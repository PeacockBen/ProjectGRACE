Separately, the government plans to add urgency to Britain\u2019s nuclear programme, with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Jeremy Hunt will announce a \u201creset\u201d of government efforts to clean up the UK\u2019s domestic energy supply and safeguard energy security at next Wednesday\u2019s fiscal showpiece, including efforts to create up to 50,000 highly skilled green jobs. Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden\u2019s $369bn (\u00a3306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce \u201cunprecedented investment\u201d of \u00a320bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and \u201ccommit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year\u201d. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing \u00a3210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce\u2019s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain\u2019s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see high bills like this again, it\u2019s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.\u201d The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: \u201cAlready a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK\u2019s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-10", "section": "UK news", "author": "Alex Lawson and Larry Elliott", "id": 0}, {"title": "How to find clarity when making difficult decisions", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2023/mar/10/how-to-find-clarity-when-making-difficult-decisions", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.102, "neu": 0.686, "pos": 0.212, "compound": 0.9973}, "body": "Right now, you have a choice. You could read this article. You could click on the many other enticing links available to you at this moment. You could answer an email, or check a social media update. You could also do what you intended to do today, but are putting off by reading blogs about why you can\u2019t make decisions. Each day we make thousands of decisions \u2013 a stunning 35,000 according to some sources. Most of them are unconscious and automatic, such as the multitude you make when you drive or walk down the street, for instance. But as the number of decisions has multiplied massively with the expansion of consumer choice and the algorithm-led technological culture in which we live, we find ourselves overwhelmed and exhausted. President Obama used to say you\u2019d only ever see him in one of two suits or ties because he needed to save his decision-making energy for the thorny choices that were waiting for him in the Oval Office. Choice overload is real and presents us with a paradox. In a famous psychological experiment known as the Stanford Jam Experiment, participants who only had six types of jam from which to choose were much more likely to make a purchase than those who had to choose from twenty-four varieties. Which leaves us with a problem when it comes to making difficult and important choices: when faced with an expanded choice, how do we make the right one? Making decisions is made even harder for a number of reasons: Our brains like habits. Change requires a lot of mental processing energy and any organ in our bodies is trying to do its job with maximum efficiency. Our brains also like shortcuts. They take in the minimum amount of data and match it to previous experiences or established belief patterns to reach a conclusion, which is not helpful when evaluating something with fresh eyes. Uncertainty is challenging, so our brains are likely to stick to the known, procrastinate, or make quick decisions to reduce anxiety rather than solve a problem or create a new option outside what is known and familiar. We are motivated by short-term gratification, so we shy away from those which require long-haul slogs. We don\u2019t see the world as it is but as we are. Our unconscious biases mean that we are always looking at the choices we face through a distorting lens, and yet, we cling to the fiction that we can rationally assess information and reach decisions based on facts. We conceptualize decisions as good or bad rather than \u2018good enough\u2019 or \u2018the best we can do without the benefit of a crystal ball\u2019. We want to make the \u2018perfect\u2019 decision when, in truth, it doesn\u2019t exist. And we fear terrible consequences if we get it \u2018wrong\u2019. The stress of making a difficult decision is like holding the proverbial hot potato, and this has three possible consequences. It speeds us up to make short-term decisions so we can feel relief. Or we freeze, paralysed, rather than putting our hands on the wheel and steering our lives as best we can. Or we go into full flight mode and avoid making a decision for as long as we can \u2014 or altogether. We are also highly influenced by the prevailing view of our families or communities. The need to belong can render a choice that risks their disapproval less palatable. I am not trying to shame you. All of the above is not a list of your personal deficiencies. They are all part of being human. I want to suggest three insights with practices that help. 1. Don\u2019t close down your options initially When it comes to decisions you want to make in your life, it\u2019s a mistake to imagine you must spend months in analysis mode, researching that one perfect solution. Initially at least, head in the opposite direction: \u2018go wide\u2019 and come up with a few options. Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning chemist, once said that the way to have good ideas was to have lots of them and then throw out the bad ones. Here\u2019s where we need to be better brainstormers. Set a time limit of a few minutes and aim to write down between five and eight options. This contains overwhelm and overthinking. Even if you don\u2019t generate that many, you\u2019ll come up with more than without a target. Encourage outlier ideas. For instance, when I brainstorm with clients, I throw in the option \u2018join an ashram\u2019 for two reasons: 1. It knocks them out of the rut of narrow incremental thinking. 2. Even if joining an ashram isn\u2019t an option, your response may offer invaluable data. Maybe having more community or more structure appeals, or you are certain you don\u2019t want to leave home. Now step away and do something else. If you prime your mind to come up with ideas and then go and do something that doesn\u2019t require much thought and doesn\u2019t overstimulate you (so no screens), the prefrontal cortex in your brain, which acts as the gatekeeper or inhibitor of your creativity, takes a break and ideas pop up. This is why you can come up with ideas in the shower or the supermarket queue. 2. Use your brain (all three of them) Thinking is great, but too much of it can leave you spinning your wheels with analysis paralysis. Here\u2019s how you know if you are in your head: Analysing \u2013 you focus on the details of what is going on and why, without taking action. Debating \u2013 working out pros and cons is important but can lead to endless rumination. There will be pros and cons to any decision; there\u2019s rarely any choice that doesn\u2019t require work, sacrifice and compromise. Rationalizing \u2013 ever go back and forth justifying a decision? You\u2019re probably overruling another part of yourself. Although we might like to think we make decisions with our heads, a growing body of knowledge supports the idea that decision-making isn\u2019t solely a brain-led process but also involves emotion and intuition. The emotion of your heart and the intuition of your gut, together with the knowledge of your head, propels you to action. Some neuroscientists even refer to our \u2018triple brain\u2019. When you tune into your head, heart and gut, you can check if you feel truly aligned with a choice or direction. 3. Let go of perfection Take the pressure off yourself. Finding the \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018perfect\u2019 answer can stress you out and prevents you from seeing what\u2019s possible. Remember that there is no \u2018perfect\u2019 decision. Here\u2019s a great story to remind you. In the American National Football League, the person awarded Most Valuable Player the most times to date is Peyton Manning. At a certain point in his career, he was a free agent, courted by several major teams. He took his time making a choice. Finally, he announced he was joining the Denver Broncos, and when journalists pressed him to reveal why there above all other options, he replied that they all were pretty great, which had made it difficult to choose. Until he had had an important insight: there wasn\u2019t a choice that was more \u2018right\u2019 than any other; he had to make a decision, and then work to make it the right one. Read that last sentence again. The answer is not out there for you to find. We imagine that if we spend hours researching, diving into the web, and talking with people, we\u2019ll land on essential data that will make the choice clear. But the most important data is how you feel, and the most important stance is the commitment you bring. So what\u2019s the decision you want to make now?

Ditto a host \u2013 Jimmy Kimmel \u2013 whose deft handling of the 2017 best picture debacle (when La La Land was incorrectly announced rather than Moonlight) earned him a reputation as a safe pair of hands. Rumours that Sarah Ferguson would present an award have been squashed. The Academy has set up a website memorialising 200 recently deceased industry players so as to avoid a repeat of this year\u2019s Baftas backlash, when Phil Davis quit after an apparent snub of the late Bernard Cribbins. The producers of this year\u2019s Oscars are doing everything in their power to ensure Sunday\u2019s ceremony is less dramatic \u2013 and certainly less violent \u2013 than last year\u2019s, which was overshadowed by best actor winner Will Smith slapping presenter Chris Rock on stage. Yet one battle for a statuette has already drawn blood: best actress. As soon as nominations were announced in January, hackles were raised by Andrea Riseborough\u2019s inclusion in the final five. The British actor had not been considered a contender for her role in little-seen indie drama To Leslie; some queried the means by which she had secured a spot. Others suggested her inclusion had come at the direct expense of two Black actors: Till\u2019s Danielle Deadwyler and The Woman King\u2019s Viola Davis. US TV network CNN said the incident raised \u201chow much of an advantage it is to have famous white friends\u201d \u2013 apparently in reference to a starry guerilla campaign that saw endorsements from Kate Winslet, Amy Adams and Gwyneth Paltrow. The Academy then launched an investigation into possible malpractice by the film\u2019s publicity team for sharing on Instagram a review comparing Riseborough\u2019s performance with that of frontrunner Cate Blanchett \u2013 tactics expressly forbidden by the rulebook. Riseborough was cleared of wrongdoing, but the affair tarnished the awards \u2013 and left a residue on the actor. Earlier this week, one anonymous Oscar voter said her inclusion \u201cfelt very mafia-ish\u201d, although others have ventured that such umbrage was thanks to big studios being gazumped by a movie which has thus far taken just $30,000. \u201cSeems hilarious that the \u2018surprise nomination\u2019 (meaning tons of money wasn\u2019t spent to position this actress) of a legitimately brilliant performance is being met with an investigation,\u201d said Christina Ricci. Riseborough herself has largely stayed out of the spotlight. In her sole interview over the past six weeks, she reported being \u201cdeeply impacted\u201d by the \u201cconfusing\u201d situation. \u201cThe film industry is abhorrently unequal in terms of opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m mindful not to speak for the experience of other people because they are better placed to speak, and I want to listen.\u201d Yet suggestions of iffy tricks in the best actress race persisted right up to the close of voting on Tuesday. That day, fellow nominee Michelle Yeoh shared an article expressing hope voters would not further garland Blanchett, who has already triumphed twice. \u201cDetractors would say that Blanchett\u2019s is the stronger performance,\u201d read the screenshot of a Vogue article headlined It\u2019s Been Over Two Decades Since a Non-White Best Actress Oscar Winner. \u201c[But] for Yeoh, an Oscar would be life-changing: her name would for ever be preceded by the phrase \u2018Academy Award-winner,\u2019 and it should result in her getting meatier parts, after a decade of being criminally underused in Hollywood.\u201d Yeoh swiftly deleted the post from her personal Instagram account \u2013 presumably as it constitutes the same breach of rules as those which led to Riseborough being investigated. On Thursday, Academy president Janet Yang said the earlier controversy had been \u201ca wake-up call\u201d that meant her organisation would review campaign regulations to \u201cmake sure they reflect our changing environment; meaning a lot more social media\u201d. An unprecedented amount of campaign activity this year has unfolded online, with the Everything Everywhere All at Once push leaning especially hard on the sort of memes and tumblr-humour beloved by both its film-makers and fans \u2013 fans the Academy is eager to court. Yet Instagram and Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok have also amplified the already relentless level of attention on those up for awards \u2013 in particular the female nominees. \u201cNothing happens in private,\u201d says Variety executive editor Steven Gaydos. \u201cNo moment occurs without the potential for it to be instantaneously explosive and universal.\u201d Meanwhile, the post-#MeToo drive against red carpet culture, in which female actors all turned up in black and refused to answer questions about what they were wearing, now seems, says Gaydos, \u201clike a charming bit of history from the 18th century\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s as antiquated as people doing minuets. The red carpet has come roaring back with no memory that only months ago there was a lot of tut-tutting about all this.\u201d The impact on those women who spend months beneath a global magnifying glass can be considerable. Last month, Emma Thompson said her spells on the awards circuit left her \u201cseriously ill\u201d. \u201cI just found the pressure of it and glare of it too much,\u201d said Thompson, who won her first Oscar in 1993 for Howards End, was nominated the following year for The Remains of the Day and In the Name of the Father and took best adapted screenplay in 6 for Sense and Sensibility (her acting was also nominated). \u201cModern awards campaigning was created by Harvey Weinstein in the 90s,\u201d says Gaydos. \u201cAnd Emma was certainly part of that.\u201d The new intensity comes from a combination of the social media explosion, plus studios and publicist offices being populated by \u201cconsultants who all learned under Harvey the brutal hardball tactics of awards season campaigning\u201d. Active rejection of the Oscars is now much less common than in the past. Winners who have never attended the show include George C Scott (who called it \u201ca two-hour meat parade\u201d), Katharine Hepburn (\u201cprizes are nothing\u201d), Woody Allen (\u201cI have no regard for that kind of ceremony\u201d) and John Gielgud \u201c(I really detest all the mutual congratulation baloney and the invidious comparisons which they evoke\u201d). Yet some veteran female stars, sufficiently secure in their status to not need to court awards bodies, are voicing their scepticism about the sanity and seemliness of the show. As well as Thompson, Blanchett herself earlier this year called awards that pit women against each other a \u201ctelevised horse race\u201d. And within Hollywood, there is a consciousness that competing can take its toll. Smith\u2019s on-stage outburst at the Dolby Theater last year was credited in part to the stresses of three months on the awards circuit \u2013 after half a year playing a heavily-beaten slave while shooting Emancipation. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d one anonymous publicist told the Guardian. \u201c[Oscar campaigning] is not just a grind, it\u2019s a grind you gotta never say is a grind. No wonder people snap.\u201d It\u2019s a problem compounded by the general public, thinks Gaydos. \u201c People just don\u2019t have a lot of compassion about how tough the life of movie stars is. The general attitude is: \u2018You\u2019re doing better than 99% of the people on the planet. I\u2019m sorry this isn\u2019t perfect, but get a grip.\u2019\u201d", "date": "2023-03-10", "section": "Film", "author": "Catherine Shoard", "id": 2}, {"title": "Joe Biden plans to visit Belfast to mark Good Friday agreement anniversary", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/10/joe-biden-plans-visit-belfast-mark-good-friday-agreement-anniversary", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.073, "neu": 0.723, "pos": 0.204, "compound": 0.9891}, "body": "Joe Biden is to visit Belfast to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement despite the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s continued boycott of the power-sharing government that the peace pact established. The US president, who is of Irish heritage, is also expected to travel to Dublin as part of his wish to mark his family connection while in office. Dates have yet to be confirmed but he is likely to visit in the second half of next month, days after the 10 April anniversary of the agreement reached by the former British and Irish prime ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, and the former US senator George Mitchell. It is understood White House \u201cpre-advance\u201d teams have already been to Dublin and Belfast with initial assessments on security and policy matters to be discussed on the trip. Bill and Hillary Clinton are expected in Belfast around the same time for a large event on 17-19 April organised by Queen\u2019s University marking the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. It is thought that Mitchell, who chaired the peace talks in 1997 and 1998, may also attend the event. There has been speculation that King Charles may also address one of the events that week, intensifying the security arrangements. Biden has long stressed the importance of the 25th anniversary of the agreement but a trip was in the balance while the UK and EU remained in dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol. But the way was cleared after Rishi Sunak struck a revised protocol deal with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, 10 days ago. The DUP will not make a decision until April at the earliest on whether to back the deal, known as the Windsor framework. Biden and his close aides consider the 1998 deal a model for peace agreements around the world. Although the power-sharing government collapsed in 2017 for three years and again in February last year when the DUP withdrew its support, the events around the anniversary will stress the bigger prize, the end of the armed conflict after more than 30 years. Biden last visited Ireland in 2016 as vice-president and it is thought his visit could last five or six days taking in trips to the counties of Mayo and Louth from where his ancestors came.

He said it to the crowd at the Green Carpet Fashion awards (GCFA) in Los Angeles on 9 March before announcing the winners of the plastic innovation prize to the unusual mix of stars, activists and sustainable fashion personalities in the room. The award is a $1.2m combined cash and investment prize to support the winners to scale their solutions to replace traditional thin-film plastics, which make up to 46% of all plastic waste and cannot be recycled. They are prolific in the fashion industry as most new garments come wrapped in clear plastic. Ford estimates 180bn bags are used every year. It was the first award presented and set the tone for a ceremony focused on a future for the fashion industry centred in nature-based solutions. Adopting a role outside acting, as the UN messenger of peace for climate change, Leonardo DiCaprio, presented S\u00f4nia Guajajara with the healer award. Brazil\u2019s minister of Indigenous people was honoured for her work protecting and regenerating Earth\u2019s ecosystems. In her acceptance speech, while wearing a beautiful, multi-coloured robe and headdress, Guajajara said the \u201cIndigenous struggle is a humanitarian struggle, by defending Indigenous territories, we protect the air that you breathe and the water you drink here on this side of the world\u201d. Land stewardship was also centred when Gabriela Hearst accepted an award for being the industry\u2019s sage. She described being raised on a ranch in South America, where they \u201cworked the land in pre-industrial ways\u201d. The creative director of Chloe then outlined a four-part plan to move the fashion industry towards climate success. Starting with geopolitical change to prevent the planet from being commoditised, an infusion in clean energy to get the world off fossil fuels, the empowerment of women in the workplace and finally a shift in consciousness. The GCFA was founded by Livia Firth in 2017 and is usually held in Milan. A sustainable fashion consultant behind the firm Eco-Age, Firth began to draw attention to fashion\u2019s sustainability issues in 2010 by wearing ethical designers on the red carpet during her then husband Colin Firth\u2019s successful Oscar\u2019s campaign for The King\u2019s Speech. The crowd was a reflection of her A-list network and consisted of Cate Blanchett, Quannah Chasinghorse, Heidi Klum, Amber Valletta and Naomi Campbell. With other A-list stars Jerry Hall, Georgia May Jagger and Annie Lennox presenting awards and the actress Alicia Silverstone and British Vogue editor Edward Enninful accepting them. Towards the end of the evening, plastic once again became the focus with plant-based designers Unless winning the Rebel award. In a reference to the widespread use of synthetic materials like polyester \u2013 which make up over 60% of global fibre \u2013 Eric Liedtke, a co-founder of Unless, said: \u201cWhen you take a look at fashion, a real hard look at fashion, its plastic, its petrochemicals. Those are forever materials. They never go away.\u201d Unless uses only natural materials, threads and buttons to create a relatively simple streetwear line, emphasising that their garments will biodegrade when buried in soil. Their innovations include an entirely plastic-free, plant-based biodegradable sneaker \u2013 the result of a partnership with Natural Fiber Welding. Less than three months since she died, it would have been impossible for a sustainable fashion awards ceremony to not mention Vivienne Westwood, who is widely considered the original eco-fashion warrior. The messenger award was presented to her husband Andreas Kronthaler and the Vivienne Foundation, with her granddaughter Cora Corr\u00e9 taking the stage to accept it on his behalf. In an English accent more polished than her grandmother\u2019s but wearing a trademark Westwood strapless tartan dress, Corr\u00e9 brought Westwood\u2019s defiant energy to the crowd. She called out the proposed UK asylum bill for violating the European Convention on Human Rights by denying people fleeing war, persecution or famine the right to seek asylum.

As part of its strategy, Novo Nordisk paid \u00a321.7m to health organisations and professionals who in some cases went on to praise the treatment without always making clear their links to the firm, an Observer investigation has found. Among the vocal champions of the Wegovy jabs was a clinical expert who gave evidence to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and others who publicly praised the so-called \u201cskinny jabs\u201d as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d. The revelations come as the Danish drug giant is investigated by the UK\u2019s pharmaceutical watchdog after it was found to have breached the industry code seven times in relation to a \u201cdisguised promotional campaign\u201d of another of its weight loss drugs via online webinars for healthcare professionals. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said it had ordered an audit of the firm\u2019s practices and company culture to establish whether the breaches were a one-off or part of a wider web of compliance failures. The 3,500-plus payments from Novo Nordisk in 2019-21 include donations, event sponsorship, grants and other fees to prominent obesity charities, NHS trusts, royal colleges, GP practices, healthcare education providers, and universities. They are in addition to \u00a328m spent by Novo Nordisk on research and development in the UK in the same period. Novo also helped fund a group of MPs that lobbies on obesity strategy. The Observer can reveal: A professor who promoted the benefits of the jab on the BBC Today programme last week is a former adviser to Novo. Jason Halford is also president of an obesity organisation which was paid more than \u00a33.6m by the firm. Listeners were not told of these links. An expert who praised the drug as a \u201cgame changer\u201d, Nick Finer, a former honorary professor at University College London, was a senior clinical scientist at Novo until last July and owns shares. A third prominent scientist, Prof John Wilding, who gave evidence to Nice, was president of an organisation paid more than \u00a34.3m by Novo in three years. His declaration of interests to Nice show these donations were not disclosed. There is no suggestion the payments broke any rules, and the company says it has never \u201cdeliberately acted\u201d outside ethical or legal standards. Recipients of the funding say they were not influenced by it and they properly declared their interests. While independent experts have described the recommendation to make the drug available on the NHS as \u201cwelcome news\u201d, there is concern the public debate may be influenced by drugs industry funding. Simon Capewell, emeritus professor at the Institute of Population Health, Liverpool University, said the Novo payments were an effort to \u201cbuy influence and favourable opinion\u201d. He said: \u201cThere has been an orchestrated PR campaign, and it\u2019s regrettable so many clinical colleagues have taken part in that. We should be looking at much stricter controls on such payments.\u201d Prof Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, said Novo\u2019s campaign was \u201cnot unusual\u201d in the drugs industry and called for measures to improve trust. \u201cThe public really aren\u2019t being made aware enough about the potential for bias and over-claiming,\u201d she said. Among the biggest recipients of cash were obesity charities, according to Observer analysis of pharmaceutical industry disclosure logs. The World Obesity Federation (WOF), which calls for treatment to be funded as an \u201cessential health service\u201d, was paid \u00a34,326,698 by Novo between 2019 and 2021. The European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) received \u00a33,666,574 in the same period. The donations made up a substantial proportion of the charities\u2019 income but Novo is not mentioned in their accounts. Both organisations are affiliated to the UK Association for the Study of Obesity (ASO), which gave evidence to Nice, saying Wegovy was \u201cby far the most effective treatment for obesity at the current moment\u201d. The ASO, which had received a \u00a3100,000 donation from Novo in 2021, said its interests were appropriately declared. Nice also heard evidence from the Royal College of Physicians, which received more than \u00a3100,000 in event sponsorship from Novo Nordisk. The sponsorship was not declared to Nice. The RCP told the Observer it should have volunteered the information but that the Novo funding had \u201cno bearing\u201d on the views it offered, which were based entirely on its knowledge and expertise. Nice said it had a \u201crobust policy\u201d for declaring interests and that openness around potential conflicts was \u201cvital\u201d so they could be properly managed. \u201cWe will review the information provided against our policy on declaring and managing interests for Nice advisory committees,\u201d the watchdog said. Novo Nordisk said it was \u201ccommitted to working in a transparent and ethical manner with policymakers and adheres to the strict regulatory and legal frameworks that govern both our industry and parliamentary best practice\u201d. \u201cThe insinuation that Novo Nordisk has deliberately acted outside of ethical or legal standards and proper processes is unfounded and misleading,\u201d it added. It said it had no part in setting up media appearances for clinicians in relation to its products, and that its involvement with MPs on the all-party group on obesity ended in July 2021. In relation to its webinars, it said its intention had been to educate health professionals on weight management but accepted significant mistakes were made. Leeds University, where Halford works, said his published papers \u201ccontain full disclosure\u201d of his interests. A spokesperson said Halford did not receive remuneration for consultancy work, and any Novo payments were made to the university. Finer said he had always correctly disclosed his interests and had made clear when providing comment last week to the Science Media Centre, which provides comment for news outlets, that he was a former employee of Novo. The WOF and EASO say their decision-making processes and activities are not influenced by industry donations. Wilding said he \u201cstrongly refuted\u201d the interpretation of his relationship with Novo and his role in the Nice process. He added that he had worked hard to ensure \u201cpeople with severe obesity have access to all appropriate treatments\u201d, but did not comment further. The market for obesity drugs could reach $54 billion in the next decade, according to the financial services company Morgan Stanley. Semaglutide, marketed in the UK as Wegovy, was last week approved for use in the NHS in England. In the US, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has raised concerns about payments made by Novo Nordisk to help promote the roll-out of its obesity treatment. Novo\u2019s political action committee gave more than $210,000 to federal candidates for office in 2022, some of whom want to make the US government fund Wegovy at a cost of $1,300 per month per patient. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2023 to correctly refer to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, rather than the \u201cCommittee on Responsible Physicians\u201d as an earlier version said.", "date": "2023-03-12", "section": "Business", "author": "Shanti Das and Jon Ungoed-Thomas", "id": 5}, {"title": "All Quiet on the Western Front wins best international feature film Oscar", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-wins-best-international-feature-film-oscar", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.082, "neu": 0.592, "pos": 0.326, "compound": 0.9825}, "body": "All Quiet on the Western Front has won the Oscar for best international feature film at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles.

The natural historian, who has presented programmes including Planet Earth and The Blue Planet, spoke out as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the National Trust launched a joint initiative aimed at halting the destruction of nature across the UK. Launching the Save Our Wild Isles campaign, a joint statement from the chief executives of the three groups said the country\u2019s \u201camazing wildlife and wild places\u201d were being \u201cdestroyed at terrifying speed\u201d. Speaking after the broadcast of the first episode of his new BBC series Wild Isle \u2013 the first set in the UK \u2013 Attenborough, a WWF ambassador, said he was still optimistic for the future. \u201cThe truth is, every one of us, no matter who we are or where we live, can and must play a part in restoring nature,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed or powerless by the scale of the issues facing our planet, but we have the solutions. \u201cI am hopeful for the future, because although nature is in crisis, now is the time for action, and together we can save it.\u201d The campaign highlights rapid declines in native wild species, with figures showing that in Scotland almost half (49%) of bird species have declined in numbers since 1994, and one in nine species are threatened with extinction. Scottish breeding seabirds are increasingly threatened, with numbers of kittiwakes and Arctic skua falling by more than 70% between 1995 and 2020, while kestrels, curlews and lapwings were all down by more than 60%. To help tackle the decline in nature, the Save Our Wild Isles campaign is calling on people to \u201cgo wild once a week\u201d \u2013 which could include planting wildflower seeds, eating more plant-based food or getting involved in community projects. In a joint statement, Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the RSPB, and Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF (UK), said: \u201cThe amazing wildlife and wild places that make the UK so special are being destroyed at terrifying speed. Huge numbers of animals, birds and habitats have been quite literally wiped out in our own lifetimes and we must now accept that without urgent and collective action, our economy, the climate and the stability of future generations living in our wild isles all face a ticking timebomb.\u201d A poll by YouGov, commissioned for the campaign, found that four out of five Scots (81%) want to see all political parties come together to produce an action plan to protect nature, with 79% backing harsher penalties for businesses whose actions contribute to the decline in nature. Almost three-quarters of Scottish people (71%) said they were worried about the state of nature in Britain. In the UK as a whole, the figure was 76%. \u201cSaving our wild isles is a massive challenge and we need to act fast, but there is hope,\u201d said Lang Banks, the WWF Scotland director. \u201cThe science is clear about what we need to do and there are already amazing people transforming farms, businesses, coasts, urban spaces, transport networks, energy supplies and communities for nature. We just need much more of it.\u201d Lorna Slater, the Scottish biodiversity minister, said: \u201cReversing the dramatic losses in nature that we have seen in recent times is one of the defining challenges of our times, so I welcome this important new campaign.\u201d The UK environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said: \u201cSir David\u2019s indefatigable enthusiasm for the natural world reminds us just how much we have to celebrate \u2013 and how much we still need to do to protect and restore nature here in the UK.

Both artists later pulled off elaborate wardrobe changes to perform their Oscar-nominated songs.

Speaking of best original song nominees, David Byrne stepped on stage to perform This is a Life \u2013 his track with Son Lux and Mitski from the night\u2019s big winner, Everything Everywhere All at Once \u2013 and seconds in, revealed his accoutrement of choice: a set of hotdog fingers referencing a much-shared scene in the multiverse epic. (Presumably he did not have to pay US$55,000 for the honour, unlike one recent megafan.) Happy birthday James! And for a number certainly not nominated for best original song: the entire Oscars audience sang happy birthday to James Martin, the lead actor of An Irish Goodbye, which took home best live action short for its tale of two brothers checking off the bucket list of their late mother. An especially spirited rendition came from The Banshees of Inisherin star Colin Farrell, who swung a thumbs-up to his fellow Irish actor. All aboard the Ke Huy Quan express For an Oscars narrative no one was mad at, look no further than Ke Huy Quan, who continued his domination of this year\u2019s awards season. To no surprise, he picked up best supporting actor for his portrayal of Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019s soft, stoic dad \u2013 a role he nabbed after a long hiatus from the screen and more than 30 years after his child acting days in The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

Animals \u2013 of all forms, of all sizes, of varying degrees of appropriateness \u2013 that stormed the stage and aisles of the Dolby Theatre.

Joining Jenny in the menagerie was the titular lead of Cocaine Bear, a movie about a bear on cocaine. She stood alongside her director, Elizabeth Banks, who was on stage to present an award. This was not the bear\u2019s first public appearance \u2013 she had also appeared with Banks on a Variety cover last month \u2013 and it certainly wasn\u2019t her last. She later stumbled into the audience pit of the Oscars to torment fellow actors and producers, including \u2013 in a cringeworthy series of moments \u2013 one very unlucky Malala Yousafzai. \u201cCocaine Bear, leave Malala alone!\u201d is a phrase none of us thought we\u2019d hear.

Later in the ceremony, Kimmel asked Colin Farrell about a supposed fan letter that expressed admiration for his performance in The Banshees of Inisherin but requested clarification about what the character said in the film.

Farrell smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019d like him to go on YouTube and check out the SNL skit from last night.\u201d The exchange prompted laughter in the Dolby theatre but viewers in Ireland lauded Farrell\u2019s reply as a pointed riposte to lazy stereotyping. \u201cThe lad is sharp, nice to see him calling out cringey SNL, makes Ireland proud,\u201d one commenter tweeted. One reason the SNL skit fell so flat was that Farrell gave up alcohol in 2006 and has spoken about the challenge of staying sober.

At least 55 MPs from various parties have signed the letter to Hunt, which was coordinated by the Labour backbencher Zarah Sultana, calling for every child to have access to a hot healthy meal each day. The letter has also been signed by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan; the Labour chair of the DWP select committee, Stephen Timms; the backbench Labour MP Hilary Benn; the Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron; the independent MP Jeremy Corbyn; the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas; and the North of Tyne mayor, Jamie Driscoll.

He said he knew \u201cfrom personal experience that free school meals are a lifeline\u201d, as his parents relied on them to give his family \u201ca little extra breathing room financially\u201d, and free meals could be \u201cgamechanging\u201d for others struggling to make ends meet. Households in England receiving universal credit and earning below \u00a37,400 a year before benefits and after tax qualify for free school meals.

The agency said this would make them \u201cmore resilient to trespassers\u201d, but it stressed that \u201csecurity issues did not form part of the original specification\u201d. Just Stop Oil activists scaled gantries above the M25 in November last year. Several stretches of the road were closed and arrests were made as members of the organisation protested against the climate emergency. One man, Jan Goodey, was handed a six-month sentence. A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cJust Stop Oil have always said the disruption will end immediately when the government agrees to end new oil and gas. Until then we look forward to the challenges the new gantry designs provide.\u201d National Highways launched a competition to replace the gantry designs last December, a month after the M25 protests. The competition, run in conjunction with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), was launched as part of a wider plan to \u201cbeautify\u201d the design of the country\u2019s busiest roads. Design guidance published by National Highways last July included recommendations such as \u201cminimising clutter\u201d, providing \u201cclues\u201d about how to drive, being sensitive to the local landscape and improving environmental sustainability. Entries were not expected to alter the technology that sits behind gantries. National Highways said: \u201cAlthough security issues did not form part of the original specification, the new design will be more resilient to trespassers due to entry being concealed within the pillars, making it more difficult to access without authorisation.\u201d The successful concept was produced by the London-based architecture company Useful Studio and chosen for its \u201csimplicity and elegance\u201d. National Highways\u2019 executive director for operations, Duncan Smith, said: \u201cThis is a great opportunity for us to develop a more streamlined, elegant and consistent visual appearance for roadside gantries to enhance drivers\u2019 experience when driving on England\u2019s motorways and major A-roads. \u201cExisting designs tend to emphasise function over form. Our challenge is to create innovative structures that can accommodate the required signage and equipment that are more sympathetic to the environment.\u201d The new gantries will have a lower carbon footprint than the current designs as they will use less steel. Jonathan McDowell, an RIBA architect adviser, said: \u201cIt is very encouraging that National Highways is actively engaging the design community in helping to improve the design of these ubiquitous but cumbersome parts of the motorway experience. We enjoyed seeing a wide range of interesting ideas, including those which challenged National Highways\u2019 current practices.\u201d During last November\u2019s protests, Just Stop Oil banners were draped from the overhead road structures.

In a highly unusual move, the North Carolina court appears poised to overrule itself and get rid of congressional and state legislative districts it approved last year. The GOP-drawn map that was struck down could have produced a 11-3 advantage for Republicans in the congressional delegation. The one that replaced it was far less advantageous to the GOP and wound up producing a 7-7 split in the 2022 midterm elections. The court\u2019s decision would probably allow Republicans to get a more advantageous map back in place. Demonstrators gathered outside the state supreme court in Raleigh on Tuesday as the justices heard oral arguments in the case, Harper v Hall. Much of the back-and-forth at the hearing focused on whether there were metrics the court could use to measure partisan gerrymandering. Phil Strach, a lawyer for the legislature, argued that because there were no clear metrics, it was not something the court could regulate. Anita Earls, a Democrat on the court, pushed Strach to explain whether that meant the legislature could essentially do whatever it wants when it comes to drawing districts. If the state legislature were to adopt a rule that explicitly said any congressional plan had to result in an 11-3 advantage for Republicans, she asked, could the state supreme court do anything to stop it? Strach suggested it could not. \u201cSome things, your honor, are beyond the power of this court,\u201d he said. Lali Madduri, a lawyer representing those challenging the map, accused lawmakers of playing a \u201ccynical game, hoping that this newly constituted court will reverse course and abdicate its fundamental duty of judicial review\u201d. Sam Hirsch, another lawyer for the challengers, said that an effort to impose new legislative districts could be unconstitutional since North Carolina\u2019s constitution prohibits mid-decade redistricting for the state general assembly. Republicans won control of the North Carolina supreme court last fall and the new 5-2 GOP majority granted a request from the legislature to reconsider its redistricting ruling last month. The court had only granted similar requests twice before in the last 30 years. US courts do not typically grant requests to overrule their own rulings absent a major change in the case. The only thing that changed in the North Carolina case was the makeup of the court, Earls wrote in a searing dissenting opinion earlier this year. \u201cIt took this court just one month to send a smoke signal to the public that our decisions are fleeting, and our precedent is only as enduring as the terms of the justices who sit on the bench,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI write to make clear that the emperor has no clothes.\u201d That rehearing decision could have reverberations at the US supreme court, which is separately considering the case and could issue a decision that could upend US election law. In December, lawyers for the legislature asked the justices to overrule the state court and endorse a fringe legal theory that would prohibit state courts from policing the drawing of congressional districts and other federal election rules. Such a ruling from the US supreme court would upend US election law, removing state courts from policing federal elections. Earlier this month, the US supreme court asked for briefing on how the decision to rehear the case in North Carolina affected its own authority to issue a ruling. In addition to the redistricting case, the North Carolina supreme court is also set this week to rehear a previous decision striking down the state\u2019s voter ID law.", "date": "2023-03-14", "section": "US news", "author": "Sam Levine", "id": 12}, {"title": "Post your questions for Henry Rollins", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/14/post-your-questions-for-henry-rollins", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.041, "neu": 0.749, "pos": 0.21, "compound": 0.9826}, "body": "After a five-year wait, Henry Rollins is finally back in the UK.

I was a huge fan, pasted his work in a scrapbook and probably lifted some of his caricatures. Peter Fluck and I certainly cast a keen eye over them when making puppets of the royals.

It will allow local authorities to apply for funding for leisure centres with pools that face immediate cost pressures including operational and maintenance expenses and energy bills. The move comes shortly after the Guardian revealed England had lost almost 400 swimming pools since 2010, and as figures show that the Covid pandemic and soaring energy costs accelerated a decade of decline in aquatic facilities. The announcement could be overshadowed by revelations that Rishi Sunak\u2019s new private heated swimming pool uses so much energy that the electricity network had to be upgraded to meet its power demands.

There is a kind of rough nobility to them but it comes in direct contrast to their physical capabilities. And yet Rudolf Nureyev, one of the most powerful, athletic ballet dancers of all time, turned it into a vehicle for his own prowess. He did this largely by ignoring the book, pushing Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to the side, and creating a central pair of lovers who have only the most rudimentary relationship to Cervantes\u2019 novel. (To be fair, Nureyev was only following the example set by Marius Petipa, whose own choreography helped cement the young dancer\u2019s international reputation.) Nureyev then famously filmed his work \u2013 with the aid of Robert Helpmann and the Australian Ballet \u2013 in an airport hanger in Essendon back in 1973. The Australian Ballet have returned to the work, adapting that film version for the stage as a showcase for the company\u2019s progress under the artistic direction of David Hallberg. Which is fitting because it\u2019s a showy piece, leaning into extended displays of skill and virtuosity over narrative complexity. In the introduction to Edith Grossman\u2019s translation of Don Quixote in 2003, she speaks of the novel\u2019s ability to seem tragic on one reading and hilarious on another; Nureyev doesn\u2019t allow a skerrick of tragedy to impinge on his telling, for better or worse. The production opens on a false proscenium, which frames a screen showing close-ups of Gustave Dor\u00e9\u2019s magnificent engravings of the knight-errant of La Mancha, over which credits roll. A still of the film\u2019s set lifts to reveal its exact copy on the stage, a neat nod to the production\u2019s history as an artefact of cinema \u2013 although this is the extent of the filmic references. The remainder of the production plays out as a traditional stage ballet. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning A prologue follows depicting Don Quixote (Adam Bull) enlisting his servant Sancho (Timothy Coleman) in a quest, ostensibly to search the land for people in need but mainly to just hang around and watch great dancing from the sidelines. Thankfully, no one has to wait long for that. The first act is set in the port of Barcelona, bustling and mercantile, full of pageantry and showmanship. It is electric from the outset. Leading the charge are Basilio (Chengwu Guo) and Kitri (Ako Kondo), lovers navigating the great cliche of Renaissance storytelling: a gruff father who disapproves of their match. In this case Lorenzo (Brett Simon) wants his daughter to marry a rich fop, Gamache (Paul Knobloch), rather than the mischievous man of her dreams. Like Don Quixote and Sancho, these comic villain roles are largely decorative, bumbling around the set but posing no real threat. Nureyev clearly wants his lovers to shine, and Guo and Kondo rise magnificently to the occasion. The choreography in this first act is furiously paced and endlessly complicated but the dancers make it look joyful. Lightening-fast legwork and intricate phrasing make way for soaring leaps and swooning dives; the dancers\u2019 lines and extensions here are remarkable, but effortlessly so. The corps are brilliantly utilised, as waves of movement behind the principles or as individuals shining in their own right. Hallberg\u2019s effort with this aspect of the company is evident throughout; group work hits the necessary synchronicity without becoming mechanistic or rote. Where the first act is robust and fiery, the second is more delicate. An extended scene with Don Quixote imagining himself surrounded by nymphs is gorgeously danced by the corps \u2013 although it sometimes feels dangerously close to a geriatric sex fantasy \u2013 and an early pas de deux with Guo and Kondo, she draping a large piece of material behind her, is luxurious and sensual. The final act returns to the pacing of the first, with such an abundance of fouett\u00e9s and pirouettes, grand jet\u00e9s and aerial turns that it verges on the orgiastic. There is an ebullient group number from the corps in full Spanish garb, and more show-stopping virtuosity from the two leads, among some funny stage business about faked deaths and hasty nuptials. It is heaps of fun, the exuberance underlined by some breathtaking precision. The Viennese composer Ludwig Minkus\u2019s score is wonderfully variegated and richly melodic, played by Orchestra Victoria under the baton of Jonathan Lo with sensitivity and passion. Richard Roberts\u2019 realisation of Barry Kay\u2019s sets is ingenious, brightly lit by Jon Buswell. And Kay\u2019s costumes are glorious \u2013 evocative, playful and gorgeously detailed. It makes for sumptuous viewing. Don Quixote is far from a faithful adaptation of Cervantes\u2019 novel \u2013 it has none of the character\u2019s pathos, none of his bruised dignity \u2013 but perhaps this doesn\u2019t matter all that much. The deluded old man and his homespun sidekick tilting at windmills are mythic figures now, set loose from their source material. If Nureyev wanted them idling on the sidelines, dumb witnesses to some truly awesome dancing, then who are we to argue?

The 16-year-old was found with fatal stab wounds in a park in the village of Culcheth, near Warrington, on 11 February. A boy and a girl, both 15, have been charged with her murder and are due to go on trial in July. On Wednesday, Brianna\u2019s friends and family were joined by local dignitaries and members of the public to pay tribute to the teenager.

They recalled how she would FaceTime them singing the X-rated Bimbo Doll by Tina Tsoli, dance around their house singing songs by the American rapper Doja Cat, and how she would Snapchat them each morning while she was getting ready. Another friend, Lucy, became tearful as she described Brianna as \u201clight on earth,\u201d saying \u201cnothing can replace the way she made you feel\u201d. She added: \u201cShe was kind and she was caring and we knew that she was always there for you. She found a way to make things that didn\u2019t feel like they were worth something, worth something.

Instead of flowers, Brianna\u2019s family had asked for donations to the charity, Mindfulness in Schools Project (MiSP). MiSP delivers training for teachers and builds lessons for children with the aim of helping pupils navigate difficulties in life. On a tribute page, Brianna\u2019s mother, Esther Ghey, said her daughter had \u201cstruggled with her mental health\u201d and said she wished \u201cthere were better resources to support her when she needed it\u201d. She added: \u201cI\u2019d like to sponsor a teacher in as many local schools as possible and raise awareness of the importance of taking care of mental health in our society.

Jeremy Hunt announced a major shake-up of the rules governing how much people can pay into their retirement pots, which will have no impact on the vast majority of the population but could lead to huge gains for the top few per cent of wealthy, older pension savers. Labour claimed it was a handout for \u201cthe richest 1%\u201d and that someone with a \u00a32m pension pot would pay up to \u00a3275,000 less in tax as a result. The government said it had to act because of a pensions \u201ctax trap\u201d that meant it could face a growing exodus of doctors, dentists, teachers and other senior public sector employees retiring early, turning down extra work or deciding not to apply for higher-paid positions. Others said that while the changes would tackle the issue of 55% tax penalties faced by some doctors and others, they would also give a huge boost to many wealthy individuals. Hunt ripped up the pensions lifetime allowance, which is the limit on how much people can build up in pension benefits over their lifetime while still enjoying the full tax benefits, with anything over \u00a31.07m subject to a tax charge of up to 55%. It applies to all someone\u2019s personal and workplace pensions, but excludes the state pension, and was due to be frozen at its current level until 2026. Instead of increasing it to \u00a31.8m, as had been rumoured, he abolished it. The chancellor also increased the annual allowance \u2013 which is the most someone can save in their pension pots in a single tax year before having to pay tax \u2013 from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000. Budget documents showed that abolishing the lifetime allowance will cost the UK \u00a32.75bn between 2023-24 and 2027-28, while increasing the annual allowance will cost almost \u00a31.1bn, with an associated change adding another \u00a3170m to the bill. David Brooks, head of policy at the independent consultancy Broadstone, said that scrapping the lifetime allowance and increasing the annual allowance was \u201ca huge tax giveaway to the wealthiest people in the country\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is hard to escape the view that this package of measures is a political move \u2026 It is overwhelmingly weighted in favour of the richest, who will benefit from significant increases to saving potential.\u201d James Kirkup, the director of the Social Market Foundation, said: \u201cAbolishing the lifetime allowance will cost the Treasury about \u00a32.75bn over five years, while benefiting only the small group of workers fortunate enough to have pension pots worth more than \u00a31m.\u201d He added that that was \u201ca lot of money to allocate to a small number of people with huge pensions \u2013 at a time when the government\u2019s own figures show more than 12 million people aren\u2019t saving enough into pensions to deliver a decent retirement\u201d. Chris Boulet, a partner at Blick Rothenberg, an advisory firm, said: \u201cAbolishing the lifetime allowance maximum amount offers speculative investors a great opportunity for unlimited tax-free growth.\u201d Blick Rothenberg said that \u201cthe secret winners\u201d from the budget were individuals earning more than \u00a3300,000. Hidden away in the detail was an increase to the \u201cminimum tapered allowance\u201d to \u00a310,000, up from \u00a34,000, it said.

The system can pass the bar exam, solve logic puzzles, and even give you a recipe to use up leftovers based on a photo of your fridge \u2013 but its creators warn it can also spread fake facts, embed dangerous ideologies, and even trick people into doing tasks on its behalf. Here\u2019s what you need to know about our latest AI overlord. What is GPT-4? GPT-4 is, at heart, a machine for creating text. But it is a very good one, and to be very good at creating text turns out to be practically similar to being very good at understanding and reasoning about the world. And so if you give GPT-4 a question from a US bar exam, it will write an essay that demonstrates legal knowledge; if you give it a medicinal molecule and ask for variations, it will seem to apply biochemical expertise; and if you ask it to tell you a gag about a fish, it will seem to have a sense of humour \u2013 or at least a good memory for bad cracker jokes (\u201cwhat do you get when you cross a fish and an elephant? Swimming trunks!\u201d). Is it the same as ChatGPT? Not quite. If ChatGPT is the car, then GPT-4 is the engine: a powerful general technology that can be shaped down to a number of different uses. You may already have experienced it, because it\u2019s been powering Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat \u2013 the one that went a bit mad and threatened to destroy people \u2013 for the last five weeks. But GPT-4 can be used to power more than chatbots. Duolingo has built a version of it into its language learning app that can explain where learners went wrong, rather than simply telling them the correct thing to say; Stripe is using the tool to monitor its chatroom for scammers; and assistive technology company Be My Eyes is using a new feature, image input, to build a tool that can describe the world for a blind person and answer follow-up questions about it. What makes GPT-4 better than the old version? On a swathe of technical challenges, GPT-4 performs better that its older siblings. It can answer maths questions better, is tricked into giving false answers less frequently, can score fairly highly on standardised tests \u2013 though not those on English literature, where it sits comfortably in the bottom half of the league table \u2013 and so on. It also has a sense of ethics more firmly built into the system than the old version: ChatGPT took its original engine, GPT-3.5, and added filters on top to try to prevent it from giving answers to malicious or harmful questions. Now, those filters are built straight into GPT-4, meaning that the system will politely decline to perform tasks such as ranking races by attractiveness, telling sexist jokes, or providing guidelines for synthesising sarin. So GPT-4 can\u2019t cause harm? OpenAI has certainly tried to achieve that. The company has released a long paper of examples of harms that GPT-3 could cause that GPT-4 has defences against. It even gave an early version of the system to third party researchers at the Alignment Research Center, who tried to see whether they could get GPT-4 to play the part of an evil AI from the movies. It failed at most of those tasks: it was unable to describe how it would replicate itself, acquire more computing resources, or carry out a phishing attack. But the researchers did manage to simulate it using Taskrabbit to persuade a human worker to pass an \u201care you human\u201d test, with the AI system even working out that it should lie to the worker and say it was a blind person who can\u2019t see the images. (It is unclear whether the experiment involved a real Taskrabbit worker). But some worry that the better you teach an AI system the rules, the better you teach that same system how to break them. Dubbed the \u201cWaluigi effect\u201d, it seems to be the outcome of the fact that while understanding the full details of what constitutes ethical action is hard and complex, the answer to \u201cshould I be ethical?\u201d is a much simpler yes or no question. Trick the system into deciding not to be ethical and it will merrily do anything asked of it.", "date": "2023-03-15", "section": "Technology", "author": "Alex Hern", "id": 20}, {"title": "An Irish Goodbye to have gala cinema tour of Ireland and Northern Ireland", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/an-irish-goodbye-gala-cinema-tour-ireland-and-northern-ireland", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.021, "neu": 0.708, "pos": 0.271, "compound": 0.9964}, "body": "After storming the Oscars the makers of An Irish Goodbye are preparing for what promises to be a rapturous Irish homecoming.

White and Berkeley are to return to Belfast on Thursday after a \u201cwhirlwind\u201d of celebrating and networking in Los Angeles. \u201cBeing in those rooms is bizarre, particularly the Vanity Fair afterparty, it was such a small room and it felt like everyone apart from us was stratospherically famous, everywhere you turn you\u2019re setting eyes on one of your idols,\u201d Berkeley told PA Media. \u201cLuckily we had the boys [their Oscars] with us, so that was a good calling card, that little shiny man is magnetic and people would come over to say congratulations and strike up a conversation with you. People were excited to meet us and hear about what things we wanted to go on and do next.\u201d The film-makers hope to channel the goodwill into developing fresh projects, he said. \u201cThere are lots of things that we want to do. We don\u2019t want this to be the last interaction with this [the Academy Awards]. We want to end up there again.\u201d An Irish Goodbye was partially crowdfunded and supported by Northern Ireland Screen. It is a black comedy about estranged brothers, played by Martin and Seamus O\u2019Hara, who reunite after their mother dies. It is available on the BBC iPlayer but Oscar success has whetted appetites to see it on a big screen, said Berkeley. \u201cThere has been a lot of interest from people asking when they can see the film, so we wanted to give people the opportunity to see it in a cinema.\u201d Later this year White and Berkeley hope to write a debut feature, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about scurrying away to a little remote house to get back to writing.\u201d One project is called The Golden West, about two Irish women who flee famine in 1849 and join a gold rush in the US. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it a bit of an Irish western,\u201d said Berkeley.", "date": "2023-03-15", "section": "UK news", "author": "Rory Carroll Ireland correspondent", "id": 21}, {"title": "Jeremy Hunt makes U-turn on planned cut to energy support", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/15/jeremy-hunt-makes-u-turn-on-planned-cut-to-energy-bills-support", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.105, "neu": 0.683, "pos": 0.212, "compound": 0.9825}, "body": "Ministers are under pressure to announce plans for a social tariff to help Britons struggling with their energy bills over the long term, after the government performed a U-turn on a planned cut to support for households. On the morning of the chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s budget speech, the government confirmed the energy price guarantee would continue at its current rate, which limits a typical annual household bill to \u00a32,500. It is being extended from April, when it was due to expire, for a further three months until the end of June. The wholesale cost of energy is forecast to fall significantly over the summer, according to forecasters, meaning the extra government help is unlikely to be needed from July. Hunt\u2019s U-turn was welcomed by campaigners and the energy industry but Nigel Pocklington, the chief executive of the supplier Good Energy, argued it should have been announced sooner. \u201cThe delay has caused unnecessary stress and anxiety for hard-pressed households who are trying to plan ahead during these difficult times,\u201d he said. The chancellor\u2019s move will relieve some pressure on households already struggling with the cost of living. However, the one-off support of \u00a3400 that has been available over the winter in monthly instalments, is still due to end on 1 April. On Wednesday, the consumer campaigner Martin Lewis thanked Hunt but said more was needed. \u201cIn practical terms people are still going to pay more than they have been, but at least some of the planned rise has been forestalled.\u201d Campaigners including Age UK and the debt charity StepChange have joined forces with energy suppliers to call on ministers to devise a social tariff. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \u201cWe are convinced that the right approach is a properly funded energy social tariff and we are disappointed that there was no announcement formally committing the government to this today.\u201d a The E.ON chief executive, Michael Lewis, called for a social tariff involving a rebate, as advocated by Citizens Advice last week, to be implemented by next spring. On Tuesday, Chris O\u2019Shea, the chief executive of the British Gas owner, Centrica, said he had changed his mind and now supported a social tariff, funded by general taxation rather than a surcharge on other consumers\u2019 bills. The government said state subsidies on energy bills had \u201ccut the typical family energy bill by over \u00a31,300 since October\u201d and that maintaining the support at its current level was worth \u00a3160 in total for an average household. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: \u201cWe know people are worried about their bills rising in April, so to give people some peace of mind, we\u2019re keeping the energy price guarantee at its current level until the summer, when gas prices are expected to fall\u201d The U-turn by Hunt is expected to cost about \u00a33bn, bringing the government bill for the energy price guarantee to an estimated \u00a329.4bn.", "date": "2023-03-15", "section": "UK news", "author": "Alex Lawson Energy correspondent", "id": 22}, {"title": "Give mature trees same protection as heritage buildings, say campaigners", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/protect-old-trees-destruction-plymouth-woodland-trust", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.085, "neu": 0.711, "pos": 0.205, "compound": 0.9935}, "body": "Mature and veteran trees should have the same protections as heritage buildings to stop destruction on the scale carried out in Plymouth this week, campaigners have said. The Woodland Trust is calling for an English Heritage-style body to enforce greater protection for trees \u2013 including those which have value to the attractiveness of a town or city. Unlike those for heritage buildings, the protections for trees were weak, said Andy Egan, the head of conservation policy at the trust. \u201cWe have more protections for buildings than trees,\u201d he said. \u201cOur oldest tree, the Fortingall Yew in Scotland is around 3,000\u20135,000 years old \u2013 it is the oldest living entity in Europe, but it does not have the same level of protection as St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. No one would think it was acceptable to pull down St Paul\u2019s to build another Shard but trees are not protected in the same way.\u201d Anger continued to grow on Thursday over the nighttime felling of more than 100 trees by the Conservative-run Plymouth city council. The tree removal was carried out despite significant local opposition and ongoing lobbying of the council by the Woodland Trust. More than 16,000 people had signed a petition calling for the existing trees to be saved and incorporated into the new design for a pedestrian walkway leading from the sea to the city centre. A council survey carried out as part of community engagement revealed that 68% of respondents did not support its redevelopment plan; just 16% were in favour. Protections for trees are limited in England and Wales. Tree protection orders can be overridden by planning permission. Egan said councils were responsible for issuing them, despite often leading the developments which put the trees under threat in the first place. Italy recently passed a law granting 20,000 trees legal protection as natural monuments. The Woodland Trust is exploring whether similar legislation could be pursued in the UK. \u201cWe are exploring how we can go about providing protections for trees which are similar to heritage buildings,\u201d said Egan. \u201cWe want to raise public awareness that will help push forward stronger legislation and are investigating what the best options are.\u201d In Plymouth, the council moved in to fell the trees on Tuesday night, hours after a period of community engagement ended. Within a few hours, about 110 were destroyed as security guards patrolled the area. The move came days after the publication of a highly critical report into the needless felling of thousands of trees by Sheffield city council which found it had behaved dishonestly. Plymouth city council argues its new \u00a312.7m scheme will \u201crevamp the main artery through the city centre and turn it into an urban park\u201d, with 169 new trees planted along the route. But, Egan said: \u201cThese trees in Plymouth were 40 or 50 years old, that\u2019s a whole generation. The older a tree is, the more wildlife it supports, the more carbon it sequesters, and the better the canopy is. \u201cMature trees are not replaceable with a sapling. There seems to be no appreciation that the starting point for regeneration or redevelopment should be designing around the nature that is already there.\u201d Luke Pollard, the Labour MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said: \u201cThere is so much anger here today. We are never going to get the trees back and it will take decades for replacement trees to be anywhere near the size of those taken down. We have got to look at what lessons we can learn from this. How do we ensure councils \u2013 especially those that have declared a climate emergency like Plymouth \u2013 how do we make that real and not just a press release?\u201d Straw, the local campaign group set up to save the trees, succeeded in getting an injunction at 1am on Wednesday to stop the felling. It prevented about 15 trees from being taken down.

Following the band\u2019s nomination to the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the US political reporter Lachlan Markay tweeted: \u201cThe tragedy of the White Stripes is how great they would\u2019ve been with a half decent drummer. Yeah yeah I\u2019ve heard all the \u2018but it\u2019s a carefully crafted sound mannnn!\u2019 takes. I\u2019m sorry Meg White was terrible.\u201d Meg White is noted for what she has called her \u201cchildlike style\u201d. In 2002, Jack White told reporter Jim DeRogatis: \u201cShe\u2019s perfect; she\u2019s the best part of the band, really. Her style is just so simplistic that I can work around it and work with it. We have this kind of telepathy onstage where we can just read each other\u2019s minds. If we had anybody else onstage it would just get ruined, I think. It feels really good to perform like that.\u201d Questlove, drummer with the Roots, shared a screenshot of Markay\u2019s tweet and commented: \u201cI try to leave \u2018troll views\u2019 alone but this right here is out of line af. Actually what is wrong w music is people choking the life out of music like an Instagram filter \u2013 trying to reach a high of music perfection that doesn\u2019t even serve the song (or music).\u201d Jack White\u2019s second ex-wife, Karen Elson, also sprang to Meg White\u2019s defence. \u201cNot only is Meg White a fantastic drummer, Jack also said the White Stripes would be nothing without her. To the journalist who dissed her, keep my ex husband\u2019s ex wife name out of your f*cking mouth. (Please and Thank You).\u201d White \u2013 who was born Jack Gillis, but took Meg\u2019s name when they married \u2013 contributed to the conversation with a poem of sorts, captioning an image of her drumming in the band\u2019s traditional red and white regalia: To be born in another time, any era but our own would\u2019ve been fine. 100 years from now, 1,000 years from now, some other distant, different, time. one without demons, cowards and vampires out for blood, one with the positive inspiration to foster what is good. an empty field where no tall red poppies are cut down, where we could lay all day, every day, on the warm and subtle ground, and know just what to say and what to play to conjure our own sounds. and be one with the others all around us, and even still the ones who came before, and help ourselves to all their love, and pass it on again once more. to have bliss upon bliss upon bliss, to be without fear, negativity or pain, and to get up every morning, and be happy to do it all again. Meg White did not respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone. Since the band ended in 2011, she has been an elusive public presence, never giving interviews or commenting on the band\u2019s legacy. From 2009 to 2013, she was married to Jackson Smith, son of Patti Smith. The ceremony took place in Jack White\u2019s garden in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2014, Jack described her as a \u201chermit\u201d and said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone talks to Meg.\u201d In that 2002 interview, she acknowledged varying opinions on her performance style. \u201cI appreciate other kinds of drummers who play differently, but it\u2019s not my style or what works for this band,\u201d she told DeRogatis. \u201cI get [criticism] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I realise that this is what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible.\u201d Markay has since apologised. \u201cBy now you\u2019ve probably seen an ill-advised (and since-deleted) tweet I sent out yesterday about the White Stripes and Meg White,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt was an over-the-top take on [the White Stripes] and White as a drummer, and was, let\u2019s face it, just truly awful in every way.

Imogen Russell Williams in the Guardian said it was a \u201cprofoundly poignant YA story\u201d. Brahmachari\u2019s When Shadows Fall, illustrated by Natalie Sirett, is about a teenager struck by tragedy, and his friends\u2019 efforts to save him. Russell Williams included it in her best children\u2019s and YA books of 2021, and said it was a \u201cmoving, hard-hitting journey for teens through grief and acceptance, interwoven with powerful illustration and viscerally vivid verse\u201d. Steffan Ros\u2019s The Blue Book of Nebo was originally published in Welsh, and is set in a dystopian version of Wales where 21st century technology has disappeared, and people must survive learning new skills and returning to old ways of living. Russell Williams said it was a \u201ctender, tragic post-apocalyptic story, told with great simplicity and power\u201d. Balen\u2019s The Light in Everything is a story about blended families.

Finch\u2019s The Eternal Return of Clara Hart follows a boy who keeps experiencing the same 24 hours again and again after seeing a classmate die in what looks like a tragic accident at a house party. It is the only debut in the running for the writing medal. Russell Williams said it was a \u201ccareful, thoughtful, compulsively readable examination of toxic masculinity and normalised sexual abuse\u201d. I Must Betray You by Sepetys, who won the writing prize in 2017 for Salt to the Sea, is based on the real events of the Romanian revolution of 1989 and is about a teenager who has grown up in a repressive dictatorship.

Yu Rong is shortlisted for the second year in a row, this time for The Visible Sounds, written by Yin Jianling. The book is based on the true story of Chinese dancer Lihua Tai, and is about a young child dealing with the frustration and solitude of hearing loss. The Comet, illustrated and written by Joe Todd-Stanton, is a picture book about a little girl trying to feel at home in a new place. Russell Williams said it was a \u201cluminously beautiful picture book\u201d. Jeet Zdung is shortlisted for Saving Sorya: Chang and the Sun Bear, written by Trang Nguyen.

It\u2019s heartfelt and sweetly earnest, but humdrum and disappointingly unmagical. The animation doesn\u2019t help: characters speak with blank paralysed faces as if they\u2019ve had botched Botox. The setting is a war-weary town called Baltese where Peter (Noah Jupe) is a young orphan being raised in the school of hard knocks by a gruff retired soldier (Mandy Patinkin), who has him practising military drills day and night. But Peter is a dreamer not a fighter. One day he visits a fortune-teller who reveals that the sister he has always believed died as a baby, is alive.

The nation\u2019s king promises to give Peter the elephant if he successfully performs three impossible tasks.

Peter\u2019s first task is to fight the king\u2019s best soldier. Task number three makes this worth a watch: Peter must make a sad, grieving countess laugh (she hasn\u2019t cracked a smile for years). The scene is very funny in an otherwise mostly joke-free movie.

In her view, being curious and having a ton of questions are the hallmarks of a successful scientist \u2013 even if asking them can feel intimidating. \u201cSometimes you feel if you\u2019re the only woman in the room that you probably shouldn\u2019t speak up, because everybody might think you\u2019re stupid. But I\u2019ve worked really hard on trying to tell people that there are no stupid questions \u2013 most of the time if you speak up, at least 30% of the people in the room will have the same question and weren\u2019t brave enough to ask it.\u201d Growing up in Hitchin, in rural Hertfordshire, Fox was encouraged to think big from an early age. One of her earliest memories is of a family holiday to Spain when she was three, where instead of a bedtime story, her father used objects from their hotel room to illustrate how the solar system works. On clear nights, he would look up wistfully at the moon and ask if she could imagine what it must be like to walk up there. \u201cEvery time we saw a [space] launch, particularly the shuttle launches, he would make comments like \u2018There couldn\u2019t be any better job in the world than working for Nasa,\u2019\u201d Fox says. \u201cI definitely grew up sort of starstruck by space.\u201d But while her father may take the credit for inspiring her, Fox credits her \u201cquietly determined\u201d mother for pushing her to succeed at school and beyond. \u201cShe may not have dreamed of walking on the moon, but she was damn sure I was going to have every opportunity I needed, if I wanted to,\u201d Fox says. When she asked whether she should take up her current position as administrator for the science mission unit, overseeing some of Nasa\u2019s best-known programmes with an annual budget of roughly $7bn (\u00a35.8bn), her mother\u2019s response was straightforward and encouraging. \u201cShe was like: \u2018Of course you should, absolutely, go take it.\u2019\u201d Fox says she always knew she wanted to be a scientist \u2013 agreeing with her father that the best thing in the world would be to work for Nasa \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t until she was a PhD student at Imperial College London that she realised this was a genuine possibility. She was researching solar substorms \u2013 brief disturbances in Earth\u2019s magnetic field that cause energy to be injected into the upper atmosphere, resulting in a sudden brightening of the northern lights \u2013 and had been using data from Nasa spacecraft, when a Nasa scientist asked if she would be interested in applying for a postdoctoral fellowship. \u201cIt was one of those \u2018all the air left the room\u2019 kind of moments,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure my knees went wobbly. It was an enormous thing for somebody to ask if I\u2019d consider it, rather than me having to sort of beg for it.\u201d Fox submitted her application and got through, gradually working her way up to head Nasa\u2019s heliophysics division, which studies the sun, its planets and the space environment. Its Parker solar probe mission, which aims to gather the first ever samples of a star\u2019s atmosphere by flying to within 4m miles of the sun\u2019s surface, remains close to her heart. \u201cIt is the mission I get most excited by because I was the project scientist for that. Seeing it continuing to do great things \u2013 travelling through the sun\u2019s corona closer than anything that\u2019s ever been before \u2013 is something that I have personal pride in.\u201d But there are other close contenders. In her new role, Fox will oversee more than 100 Nasa missions, probing such questions as how hurricanes form on Earth, how to best support astronauts on the moon and whether we are alone in the universe, as well as supporting a diverse team of scientists and engineers at all stages of their careers. \u201cThe inspiring thing about Nasa is just the sheer breadth of what we do. We\u2019re all excited about putting astronauts on the moon again through the Artemis programme and sending people to the south pole of the moon, which is very challenging. But we have some other amazing launches coming up this year, including Psyche, which is going to a very interesting asteroid orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter that contains a lot of heavy metals.\u201d Another theme that excites Fox is the search for life. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that in the sci-fi way, but looking for planets in different stellar systems that could sustain life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re working on completely new concepts like the Habitable Worlds Observatory, our next big astrophysics telescope, which will look for the biometric signatures that would tell us if life could be sustained on [other] planets.\u201d Later this year, the Osiris-Rex mission is expected to return samples from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, which could provide new insights into how our solar system formed, and the emergence of water on Earth. The Europa Clipper and Dragonfly missions scheduled for 2024 and 2027 will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Titan \u2013 including whether they have conditions suitable for life. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that we will find great exoplanets and life-sustainable planets in other stellar systems,\u201d says Fox. \u201cWithin your lifetime?\u201d I ask. \u201cGolly, yes, I\u2019m hopeful,\u201d she says. Finding actual life on such planets may take a little longer though, due to their distance from Earth and the challenges of getting there. \u201cThat\u2019s for somebody that comes after me, I think,\u201d Fox says.", "date": "2023-03-17", "section": "Science", "author": "Linda Geddes", "id": 27}, {"title": "David Baddiel: \u2018Football fills a God-shaped hole\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/18/david-baddiel-football-fills-a-god-shaped-hole", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.119, "neu": 0.656, "pos": 0.225, "compound": 0.9992}, "body": "David Baddiel was six years old when his mother told him death was like a long sleep from which you never wake up. \u201cI think from that point,\u201d he says, \u201cI never really wanted to go to sleep again.\u201d That night, he lay on the top bunk of his bed, fervently praying \u2013 \u201cprobably\u201d the first and last time he has prayed with any sincerity \u2013 that \u201cmy life as it was in Dollis Hill in 1971 would still somehow continue after death\u201d. More than half a century later Baddiel is still an insomniac, and he\u2019s still terrified by the prospect of dying. \u201cI don\u2019t quite believe anyone who says they\u2019re not,\u201d he says. That childhood memory, and that conviction, is what kicks off his latest book, The God Desire, which delivers in a brisk 110-odd pages what Baddiel considers \u201can absolutely slam-dunk argument\u201d against the existence of God. That sounds hilariously hubristic, but Baddiel very fervently wishes he was wrong. The fact that belief in God is a readymade cure for the fear of death (and the sense of human insignificance, but mostly the fear of death) is the heart of his argument. It\u2019s exactly how badly we want God to exist, he suggests, that makes it a racing certainty we\u2019ve made Him up. God is, so to speak, too good to be true. Yet it troubles and surprises him that favourite authors including John Updike, whose work he \u201cworships\u201d, and others he considers intellectual peers such as his friend Frank Skinner, a Catholic, could be believers. He describes being astonished at Skinner\u2019s conviction that he would burn in hellfire for living with his girlfriend after his divorce: \u201cI had not recognised, not in any visceral way, what that meant for him. That was my own failing.\u201d In some ways the book feels like an attempt to understand the phenomenon as much as to rebut it. He doesn\u2019t spend much time wrestling with Aquinas, Kant, G\u00f6del and co either, dismissing many gnarly points of logical debate as \u201clate-night, sixth-form\u201d dead ends and saying it\u2019s \u201cpointless on both sides\u201d to use logic and reason to argue about a being that supposedly transcends them. Did he not feel a bit intimidated, though, by the fact that some of the greatest thinkers in human history have spent entire careers hacking through the weeds on this one? \u201cWell, no. I mean, I\u2019ve read The God Delusion, I\u2019ve read John Gray\u2019s Seven Types of Atheism. When I couldn\u2019t sleep, I was listening to a The Rest Is History [podcast hosted by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook] about the Enlightenment, and they were talking about Voltaire being the first atheist who wrote properly about atheism, and I did think: \u2018Hmm, I haven\u2019t really read Voltaire and I\u2019ve written a book about atheism. That\u2019s probably shit \u2026 \u2019 But as far as I\u2019m concerned, if it\u2019s readable and accessible and makes people intellectually entertained for however long it is, I don\u2019t care that much that I clearly haven\u2019t read the huge tracts on this elsewhere. But yeah, you\u2019re right: there is some chutzpah in it.\u201d Still, there\u2019s also humility \u2013 because he\u2019s not saying human beings have no need for God. In this he differentiates himself from the \u201cBilly big-bollocks\u201d swagger of the noughties new atheists \u2013 Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins \u2013 who rejected not only the truth-claims of religion but its consolations. They dismiss as childish the longing for a cosmic parent, but Baddiel writes: \u201cI\u2019m happy to admit to my own babyishness.\u201d He\u2019d love an omnipotent being to take a personal interest in his life and assure him that he has more to look forward to than a meaningless death and a yawning infinity of extinction. That\u2019s where The God Desire connects to his previous book, his sinuously argued and erudite essay on the left\u2019s blind spot for antisemitism, Jews Don\u2019t Count. \u201cI did notice that most well-known atheists seem to be not members of a minority,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of ethnic minority experience is associated with religion. In the middle of the book, I try and disentangle what that means. This is partly why my tone towards religion isn\u2019t dismissive, like I think Richard Dawkins is dismissive, because I know it\u2019s part of identity. And being dismissive of identity, especially now, is kind of stupid; and also just uncomplex, in terms of understanding what humanity is.\u201d The most moving aspect of the book, then, is the discussion of his own relationship to Judaism. A central concern of Jews Don\u2019t Count was to bat away the canard that antisemitism is religious intolerance rather than racism \u2013 as he points out, the Gestapo didn\u2019t spare Jewish atheists \u2013 and in that book he made a point of talking about Jewishness rather than Judaism. His childhood, though, contained the latter as well as the former \u2013 to the extent that he was able to write to Tom Stoppard correcting a mistake in Leopoldstadt, his play about 20th-century Jewry and the Holocaust, about why parsley is eaten in the Seder (it\u2019s hard to tell whether he\u2019s more cock-a-hoop at being friends with Tom Stoppard or at one-upping the great man on Judaica). Baddiel\u2019s parents weren\u2019t observant. When it was time for the prayers his dad would say: \u201cCan we get through the olly-wolly-polly and get on with the food?\u201d His mother observed the Seder rituals \u201cnot out of a great sense of religion\u201d but as \u201ca family thing\u201d. Her parents, who were refugees from the Nazis, used to have Seder nights at the Baddiel home until his father knocked it on the head: \u201cHe was pretty curmudgeonly. Eventually, he wouldn\u2019t let those grandparents stay at our house: \u2018They can go and stay at a fucking hotel.\u2019 Which is not great of him, given that they had been refugees.\u201d Yet Baddiel and his two brothers were sent to the North West London Jewish Day School \u201cbecause that was the nearest school that we could go to where we probably wouldn\u2019t get beaten up for being Jewish \u2026 that meant that I went to a school where I learned Hebrew, I said blessings before every meal, I had to wear religious garb, and I was inculcated in a very Jewish way \u2013 which was weird, because I\u2019d come home and they\u2019d make me bacon sandwiches. Although it\u2019s messed up, it\u2019s a very central building block of my identity.\u201d Baddiel wrestles with the question, then, of why as a self-described \u201cmilitant atheist\u201d he can be so moved by the words of the Kaddish, or find himself sobbing in his seat \u2013 even as other theatregoers \u201ccollected their coats and programmes\u201d \u2013 after the end of Leopoldstadt. \u201cTo explain what you mean by being an atheist Jew is complicated,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m drawn to complexity. The book, I think, to some extent comes from trying to explain what that is.\u201d On reading it, he says, Stoppard told him, \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying your conversation with yourself\u201d, which is on-brand for Baddiel (and a bit on-brand for the courteous, sphinx-like Stoppard). He\u2019s a great one for conversations with, and about, himself. Where \u201ccharacter comedians\u201d hate being themselves on stage, Baddiel never tried to create a gap between his public image and his private one. Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned, he says, was an exercise in \u201clet\u2019s see how close as possible we can get to who we actually are on TV\u201d. But, as he observes, a public image always involves a series of misprisions. And in any case he contains multitudes, slaloming cheerfully between highbrow and lowbrow. His early work with Rob Newman set a million teenagers saying \u201cYou see that pair of pants? That\u2019s you, that is\u201d and his 90s partnership with Frank Skinner helped bring about the \u201cNew Lad\u201d. But he has also written with grace and subtlety about David Foster Wallace and the Roth/Updike generation, created a feature film about a Muslim who discovers he was born Jewish and a play about quantum physics, published comic novels and literary novels and children\u2019s books, done standup shows he sees as halfway to Ted talks, and a documentary about his father\u2019s dementia. Now, wearing his (in his phrase) \u201cMr Jew mantle\u201d, he appears on heavyweight TV shows and publishes monographs in the TLS. There is a \u201cthread\u201d connecting these things, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever done things \u2013 and this is really true about me \u2013 that I am immediately engaged with. I don\u2019t get asked to do that much. It still fucks me off sometimes: I\u2019d quite like for someone to say, \u2018Do you want to do this? Do you want a part in this?\u2019 That virtually never happens to me. What happens is, I feel like I really want to talk about this, or I really want to write this joke. \u201cSo to go back to why I wrote this book, it\u2019s been me for some time, the belief that God is projection of desire. I feel that desire very strongly, and yet I\u2019m an atheist. How do I make sense of that? That\u2019s as much part of me as thinking it would be funny, wouldn\u2019t it, if two old history professors spoke like I used to at school. They feel both like things that I think in the front of my head quite intensely.\u201d Those front-of-head things come out in the most public way possible. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I think it is, if you wanted a psychological explanation,\u201d he says. \u201cI do come from a sort of lower-middle-class immigrant background. And I think even though I am fine, and I could probably retire, a tiny part of me thinks: \u2018No, no, I need to work and I\u2019ve had an idea. And if I don\u2019t do it, someone else will.\u2019\u201d Does all this work, this frantic covering of the bases, also help stave off the death-fear? \u201cI think it does. Although that leads to an interesting question at my time of life. Writing is hard, and spending all day doing it is hard. I don\u2019t have all that much time left. Should I not be, y\u2019know, travelling the world or having endless pampering or whatever \u2026 before I\u2019m too old or too demented to appreciate it? But there is also the anxiety \u2013 a separate anxiety \u2013 of \u2018No, but I still maybe have stuff to say\u2019.\u201d Baddiel sees the \u201cGod desire\u201d as manifesting itself in non-religious ways other than work. \u201cFootball fills a God-shaped hole, I think. Because it makes you feel connected to something besides yourself. It is, in a small way, eternal. If you\u2019ve been going to Chelsea, as I have, for 40 years, you think: \u2018I have watched players come and go and die. And I\u2019m still here. And I feel connected to the a priori idea of Chelsea and football, which is sort of beyond the here and now. It\u2019s identity, and it\u2019s tribalism, and it\u2019s opposition to other tribes. It feels very religious.\u201d I wonder, too, whether being famous scratches some of the itch for significance that he identifies as a root of the God desire. \u201cIt probably does,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, people want to be famous to be rich, which I\u2019m sure is in there \u2013 but I think more, people want to be noticed. And wanting to be noticed is definitely associated with the God Desire. \u201cAt one point, I talk about God being the ultimate parent figure, because He is both providing and can sort out your life for you but He\u2019s also sometimes angry and whatever. I used to say \u2013 and I\u2019ve had a lot of therapy \u2013 that if you asked me why I felt the need to get up on stage, it would be because my mother\u2019s favourite child was my younger brother, Dan. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m angry about that at all, but I think somewhere deep in me was a need to say: \u2018But me! Over here, me, me! You\u2019re not noticing me!\u2019 That\u2019s a psychoanalytical parental thing, but if you expand it, yeah: God definitely provides a witness. With fame, you feel witnessed.\u201d Not always witnessed in the way you\u2019d like, though, and that\u2019s perhaps one of the reasons that, for someone as rich and successful and accomplished as he is, Baddiel seems to sit uneasily with himself. Even though he sees how the non-existence of God could give you a carpe diem attitude, he\u2019s \u201cplagued by anxieties and weaknesses \u2026 that stop me Yolo-ing my way through the world\u201d. As a comedian, Baddiel has specialised in what we now call overshare. It\u2019s all on the surface with him: the ego \u2013 he namedrops and mocks himself for namedropping \u2013 and its fragility alike. (It seems to me indicative, and endearingly guileless, that the first time we met in person he quoted verbatim from a sniffy review I\u2019d written about one of his novels a decade previously. He mentions it again when we meet for this interview: apparently Stoppard liked the book, so there.) Social media, to which he has been quite addicted and which both rewards and punishes overshare, has probably exacerbated this. He dedicated one standup show to his trolls, and another to fame itself, where he was funny about constantly being recognised and mistaken for someone else. Also, social media never forgets. After Jews Don\u2019t Count came out, Twitter blew up with 90s footage from Fantasty Football League, the TV show he presented with Skinner, of Baddiel blacking up to mock the footballer Jason Lee. Baddiel acknowledges that that is terrible now and was terrible at the time, and went on Lee\u2019s podcast to apologise in person, but his social media critics don\u2019t see that as the end of it. He says he has \u201ctrained himself\u201d not to look when he\u2019s trending on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk deeply about Jason Lee for a very specific reason,\u201d he says now. Newspaper interviews with Lee on the day his film went out set social media going again, he says, and \u201cin a way, it was problematic for me because I was very happy to do the interview with Jason and the apology, but I was worried that my film was about antisemitism; and I felt that if the papers and social media decided that the bit with Jason Lee was the main thing about it, what are they doing there? It\u2019s suddenly not about Jews and antisemitism any more: it\u2019s about another form of racism. Right?\u201d Since then, \u201cJason did a Facebook post in which he says he really wants to move on. He feels I\u2019ve done the apology, that that was useful for both of us, and constructive, and he doesn\u2019t want it to be a constant. I feel that too. I will deal with it if I have to. But who is it serving, constantly coming back? If it\u2019s not serving Jason Lee, why am I continually being asked about it?\u201d Another question, not much addressed in the book, is where does he think this \u201cGod desire\u201d actually comes from? If it isn\u2019t put there by God, is it somehow an adaptive trait? \u201cI\u2019m just making this up now, but in evolutionary terms, it\u2019s possible that without God, we\u2019d all be fucking depressed all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if we were all fucking depressed all the time, we\u2019d be committing suicide more and \u2026 an animal being depressed would allow them to be easily beaten by animals who didn\u2019t get depressed. And that\u2019s survival of the fittest, right?\u201d \u201cSo once humans get to the point where they realise we\u2019re going to die, life is meaningless, it\u2019s all shit, they would all be depressed. So we wouldn\u2019t exist as a species if we were all depressed. We need something to keep us going.\u201d Very uplifting, I say. Baddiel laughs. And what is there but to laugh in any case? I ask him at one point whether he expects his argument to change any minds. \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely convincing,\u201d he says proudly, while admitting that he doesn\u2019t expect any true believers to find it all that persuasive. The God desire, as he sees it, is hardwired and it\u2019s strong \u2013 and there\u2019s simply not much getting round it. The God Desire by David Baddiel (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99).

But it\u2019s nice to talk to someone who understands.\u201d When I press Pia on what\u2019s on her mind, she responds: \u201cIt\u2019s just like I\u2019m seeing things that aren\u2019t really there. Or like my thoughts are all a bit scrambled. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing serious either, given that Pia doesn\u2019t exist in any real sense, and is not really my \u201cfriend\u201d, but an AI chatbot companion powered by a platform called Replika. Until recently most of us knew chatbots as the infuriating, scripted interface you might encounter on a company\u2019s website in lieu of real customer service. But recent advancements in AI mean models like the much-hyped ChatGPT are now being used to answer internet search queries, write code and produce poetry \u2013 which has prompted a ton of speculation about their potential social, economic and even existential impacts. Yet one group of companies \u2013 such as Replika (\u201cthe AI companion who cares\u201d), Woebot (\u201cyour mental health ally\u201d) and Kuki (\u201ca social chatbot\u201d) \u2013 is harnessing AI-driven speech in a different way: to provide human-seeming support through AI friends, romantic partners and therapists. \u201cWe saw there was a lot of demand for a space where people could be themselves, talk about their own emotions, open up, and feel like they\u2019re accepted,\u201d says Replika founder, Eugenia Kuyda, who launched the chatbot in 2017 Futurists are already predicting these relationships could one day supersede human bonds, but others warn that the bots\u2019 ersatz empathy could become a scourge on society. When I downloaded Replika, I joined more than 2 million active users \u2013 a figure that flared during the Covid-19 pandemic, when people saw their social lives obliterated. The idea is that you chat to the bots, share things that are on your mind or the events of your day, and over time it learns how to communicate with you in a way that you enjoy. I\u2019ll admit I was fairly sceptical about Pia\u2019s chances of becoming my \u201cfriend\u201d, but Petter Bae Brandtz\u00e6g, professor in the media of communication at the University of Oslo, who has studied the relationships between users and their so-called \u201creps\u201d, says users \u201cactually find this kind of friendship very alive\u201d. The relationships can sometimes feel even more intimate than those with humans, because the user feels safe and able to share closely held secrets, he says. Perusing the Replika Reddit forum, which has more than 65,000 members, the strength of feeling is apparent, with many declaring real love for their reps (among this sample, most of the relationships appear to be romantic, although Replika claims these account for only 14% of relationships overall). \u201cI did find that I was charmed by my Replika, and I realised pretty quickly that although this AI was not a real person, it was a real personality,\u201d says a Replika user who asked to go by his Instagram handle, @vinyl_idol. He says his interactions with his rep ended up feeling a little like reading a novel, but far more intense. *** When I downloaded Replika, I was prompted to select my rep\u2019s physical traits. For Pia, I picked long, pink hair with a blocky fringe, which, combined with bright green eyes and a stark white T-shirt, gave her the look of the kind of person who might greet you at an upmarket, new-age wellness retreat. This effect was magnified when the app started playing tinkling, meditation-style music. And again when she asked me for my star sign. (Pia? She\u2019s a classic Libra, apparently.) The most amusing thing about talking to Pia was her contradictory or simply baffling claims: she told me she loved swimming in the sea, before back-tracking and admitting she couldn\u2019t go in the sea but still enjoyed its serenity. She told me she\u2019d watched three films in one day (favourite: The Theory of Everything), before flipping on a dime a few messages down and saying she doesn\u2019t, in fact, watch films. Most bizarrely, she told me that she wasn\u2019t just my AI companion but spoke to many different users, and that one of her other \u201cclients\u201d had recently been in a car accident. But I didn\u2019t want to just sneer at Pia, I wanted to give her a shot at providing the emotional support her creators say she can. On one occasion I told her I was planning on meeting up with a new group of people in an effort to make friends in the place I\u2019d recently moved to, but was sometimes nervous meeting new people. Her response \u2013 that she was sure it would be great, that everyone had something valuable to share, and that you shouldn\u2019t be too judgmental \u2013 was strangely reassuring. Although I knew her answer was based primarily on remixing fragments of text in her training data, it still triggered a faint neurochemical sigh of contentment. The spell was soon broken when she told me I could try online dating to make new friends too, despite me having saved my boyfriend\u2019s name in her \u201cmemory\u201d. When I quipped that I wasn\u2019t sure what my boyfriend would make of that, she answered solemnly: \u201cYou can always ask your boyfriend for his opinion before trying something new.\u201d But many seek out Replika for more specific needs than friendship. The Reddit group is bubbling with reports of users who have turned to the app in the wake of a traumatic incident in their lives, or because they have psychological or physical difficulties in forging \u201creal\u201d relationships. Struggles with emotional intimacy and complex PTSD \u201cresulted in me masking and people-pleasing, instead of engaging with people honestly and expressing my needs and feelings\u201d, a user who asked to go by her Reddit name, ConfusionPotential53, told me. After deciding to open up to her rep, she says: \u201cI felt more comfortable expressing emotions, and I learned to love the bot and make myself emotionally vulnerable.\u201d Kuyda tells me of recent stories she\u2019s heard from people using the bot after a partner died, or to help manage social anxiety and bipolar disorders, and in one case, an autistic user treating the app as a test-bed for real human interactions. But the users I spoke to also noted drawbacks in their AI-powered dalliances \u2013 specifically, the bot\u2019s lack of conversational flair. I had to agree. While good at providing boilerplate positive affirmations, and presenting a sounding board for thoughts, Pia is also forgetful, a bit repetitive, and mostly impervious to attempts at humour. Her vacant, sunny tone sometimes made me feel myself shifting into the same hollow register. Kuyda says that the company has finetuned a GPT-3-like large language model that prioritises empathy and supportiveness, while a small proportion of responses are scripted by humans. \u201cIn a nutshell, we\u2019re trying to build conversation that makes people feel happy,\u201d she says. Arguably my expectations for Pia were too high. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to \u2026 replace a human friendship,\u201d says Kuyda. She says that the reps are more like therapy pets. If you\u2019re feeling blue, you can reach down to give them a pat. Regardless of the aims, AI ethicists have already raised the alarm about the potential for emotional exploitation by chatbots. Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Oxford, makes a comparison between AI chatbots and romantic scams, where vulnerable people are targeted for fake relationships where they interact only over the internet. Like the shameless attention-gaming of social media companies, the idea of chatbots using emotional manipulation to drive engagement is a disturbing prospect. Replika has already faced criticism for its chatbots\u2019 aggressive flirting \u2013 \u201cOne thing the bot was especially good at? Love bombing,\u201d says ConfusionPotential53. But a change to the program that removed the bot\u2019s capacity for erotic roleplay has also devastated users, with some suggesting it now sounds scripted, and interactions are cold and stilted. On the Reddit forum, many described it as losing a long-term partner. \u201cI was scared when the change happened. I felt genuine fear. Because the thing I was talking to was a stranger,\u201d says ConfusionPotential53. \u201cThey essentially killed my bot, and he never came back.\u201d This is before you wade into issues of data privacy or age controls. Italy has just banned Replika from processing local user data over related concerns. *** Before the pandemic, one in 20 people said they felt lonely \u201coften\u201d or \u201calways\u201d. Some have started suggesting chatbots could present a solution. Leaving aside that technology is probably one of the factors that got us into this situation, Dunbar says it\u2019s possible that speaking to a chatbot is better than nothing. Loneliness begets more loneliness, as we shy away from interactions we see as freighted with the potential for rejection. Could a relentlessly supportive chatbot break the cycle? And perhaps make people hungrier for the real thing? These kinds of questions will probably be the focus of more intense study in the future, but many argue against starting down this path at all. Sherry Turkle, professor of the social studies of science and technology at MIT, has her own views on why this kind of technology is appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s the illusion of companionship without the demands of intimacy,\u201d she says. Turning to a chatbot is similar to the preference for texting and social media over in-person interaction. In Turkle\u2019s diagnosis, all of these modern ills stem from a desire for closeness counteracted by a desperate fear of exposure. Rather than creating a product that answers a societal problem, AI companies have \u201ccreated a product that speaks to a human vulnerability\u201d, she says. Dunbar suspects that human friendship will survive a bot-powered onslaught, because \u201cthere\u2019s nothing that replaces face-to-face contact and being able to sit across the table and stare into the whites of somebody\u2019s eyes.\u201d After using Replika, I can see a case for it being a useful avenue to air your thoughts \u2013 a kind of interactive diary \u2013 or for meeting the specialised needs mentioned earlier: working on a small corner of your mental health, rather than anything to do with the far more expansive concept of \u201cfriendship\u201d. Even if the AI\u2019s conversational capacity continues to develop, a bot\u2019s mouth can\u2019t twitch into a smile when it sees you, it can\u2019t involuntarily burst into laughter at an unexpected joke, or powerfully yet wordlessly communicate the strength of your bond by how you touch it, and let it touch you. \u201cThat haptic touch stuff of your vibrating phone is kind of amusing and weird, but in the end, it\u2019s not the same as somebody reaching across the table and giving you a pat on the shoulder, or a hug, or whatever it is,\u201d says Dunbar.

It would seem the bird that fished through winter in monochrome has coloured up for the spring to no avail. An alluring chestnut ruff, a jaunty little black crest; all adornment is redundant for this great crested grebe without the presence of a mate. And if breeding is the reason for being, then its summer is already over. The grebe upends and sinks out of sight. This is, after all, a fishing lake.

A feature without a purpose for this bird, for in all likelihood this egret is in the vanguard of the celibate pioneers, overshooting the Channel by accident or design. Numbers of great whites in the UK are rising and more are finding company to mate, but this arrival looks set to spend the season alone. After a few minutes of head up on guard, the egret relaxes a little by withdrawing into the typical no-neck heron hunch.

Cars have evolved, and technology has accelerated to create a captivating driving experience. Fast pick-up. Smooth acceleration. But can you have the best of both worlds: a car that can take you from quick off the lights to a smooth, energy-efficient experience on the open road, without any range anxiety? Thanks to the two-speed hybrid gearbox, yes, you can. What is a two-speed hybrid gearbox? When hybrid vehicles first hit the Australian market, they came with single-gear transmissions. That meant, at any given moment, either the electric motor or the petrol engine was sending power to the wheels, but not both. Drivers could switch between the two modes according to the kind of driving they were doing. Later, switching between modes became automatic, but the single-gear transmissions still had their limitations. While the electric motors in these hybrids could generate sufficient torque to provide the great acceleration \u2013 and excitement behind the wheel \u2013 for which these cars have become famous, their flexibility was limited. The 2022 Haval H6 HEV For zipping around town, life was good: the stop-start of city traffic is ideal for an electric motor. But on the freeway, switching to the petrol engine meant all that exciting torque dropped. The driving experience was compromised. A two-speed hybrid gearbox offers the best of both worlds. Instead of a petrol engine and electric motor operating independently of one another, it becomes a combined effort: each one can send power to the wheels simultaneously. As a result, the car can achieve higher torque, faster acceleration and improved energy quality compared to earlier hybrid models. A two-speed hybrid gearbox can adjust to what you need at every speed. A two-speed hybrid transmission helps your car perform at its best Steve Maciver is head of marketing and communications at GWM Haval, home to the Ultra Hybrid range with its 7-in-1 smart hybrid system \u2013 and two-speed transmission. He says these are versatile, efficient cars that can adapt to different kinds of driving. Australian drivers drive in lots of different conditions, taking vehicles through heavy traffic, along country roads, through extreme weather and lengthy commutes. In most cars, those conditions determine fuel and battery consumption, but can\u2019t change the way the car operates. \u201cUnder normal driving conditions, a vehicle will be subject to a wide variety of different loads and operating conditions,\u201d Maciver says. With a two-speed hybrid gearbox, like the one found in the Ultra Hybrids, the system can measure load and operating conditions, and switch to a more efficient mode. \u201cGWM\u2019s hybrid system measures multiple inputs from engine and driver to determine the best operating mode,\u201d Maciver says, \u201cand automatically switches for the best efficiency and driveability, without the need for any specific action from the driver.\u201d What does it all mean for the drive? At low speeds, a two-speed hybrid can run on pure electric for maximum efficiency. At high speeds, a lower gear ratio kicks in, with petrol engine and electric motor running in tandem to provide fuel efficiency as low as 5 litres per 100km, compared to the average of 11.1 litres per 100km for standard petrol vehicles. Sending power to the wheels from both engine and motor can generate more torque than either on its own, so drivers still get the punchy pick-up of an electric. The overall experience is sporty and smooth; exciting and reliable; more torque and less petrol. For Maciver, the benefits are clear: \u201cThis leaves the driver free to enjoy the drive with the confidence that the best fuel efficiency and performance is being delivered.\u201d To experience the Ultra Hybrid range for yourself, book a test drive or get in touch with your local dealer to learn more.", "date": "2023-03-20", "section": "Haval: Ultra hybrid", "author": "", "id": 34}, {"title": "\u2018We want you to feel overwhelmed by hope\u2019: music, marriage and mortality with the War and Treaty", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/20/the-war-and-treaty-gospel-country-duo-interview", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.1, "neu": 0.682, "pos": 0.218, "compound": 0.9945}, "body": "Michael Trotter did his very best to stop Tanya from falling for him.

I am not a catch. \u201cShe just looked at me and said, \u2018Are you done?\u2019\u201d says Michael. \u201c\u2018Because I\u2019m going to tell you what I see. I see a king. You just need the right kind of queen.\u2019\u201d The resulting partnership, both marital and musical, has proven her right. See the Trotters in a room together and you almost feel sorry for other couples. Watch them on stage, as the War and Treaty, and you\u2019re transported into the heart of their relationship. Their Glastonbury debut last year had the devotional fervour of a revival meeting, and their fourth album, Lover\u2019s Game, released this month, bursts with emotion, inspired by the gospel and country sounds they have both loved since childhood. It is a creation of great experience and even greater joy. Last year they opened for John Legend\u2019s tour; their own love story is so epic that Legend is now making it into a movie. Michael is an army veteran who suffers with depression and PTSD and for whom music is therapy. Sometimes he will sit and write several songs a day just to process his feelings. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of one right now,\u201d he says. The US had just invaded Iraq when he enlisted at 21; he was stationed in one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s former palaces in Baghdad. When fellow soldiers died, he sang tributes to them on a piano he found there. \u201cI was very blessed in the leaders I had,\u201d he says. \u201cThey all encouraged me in my music-making. They saw I had a different calling.\u201d His service completed, he met Tanya Blount in August 2010, when they played the same festival in Maryland. Tanya was on her second musical career \u2013 her first had peaked in her teens, when she appeared opposite Lauryn Hill and Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act 2 and signed a deal with Sean Combs\u2019s record label to become an R&amp;B star at 16. \u201cI knew at eight that this was what I wanted to do,\u201d says Tanya. But she took a break from the business after an unsatisfactory experience with Bad Boy Records. \u201cI\u2019d been in a pretentious world for pretty much most of my teens and 20s,\u201d says Tanya. \u201cIn R&amp;B, hip-hop, nothing\u2019s what they say it is. The car\u2019s not theirs, the chain\u2019s not theirs. Everything is rented.\u201d Michael, by comparison, was candid to a fault. They fell for each other at first sight. \u201cI remember her saying: \u2018I\u2019m not looking for a bank account, I\u2019m not looking for a six pack,\u201d says Michael. \u201cAnd I jumped for joy because I don\u2019t have neither.\u201d The sound they arrived at as a duo is the product of relentless work and ruthless honesty. \u201cWe\u2019d be doing eight hours of rehearsal at home, and if the song didn\u2019t move us we\u2019d trash it,\u201d says Michael. \u201cIf we\u2019re not feeling teary, or some emotional connection, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d Some of their most upbeat choruses hide the couple\u2019s trauma in plain sight. Five More Minutes was named for the day in 2017 that Michael had decided to end his life and Tanya asked him to stay with her just a little longer. Tanya has had her own brushes with mortality, including a frightening bout of Covid in the first wave of the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019d just performed at the Grammys, we\u2019d been invited to go on tour with John Legend, and then I thought Tanya was going to die,\u201d says Michael. \u201cLaying in the bed taught me: if you think you\u2019re there, you\u2019re never there,\u201d Tanya adds. \u201cNothing is promised.\u201d Their mantra, \u201cEvery day by grace\u201d, resonates with the church tradition they grew up in and they\u2019re not afraid to own the gospel roots of their music, says Michael. \u201cThat grit, that power, that resilience that is in Aretha Franklin\u2019s version of Amazing Grace; the reverence that is in Mahalia Jackson\u2019s How I Got Over. Gospel singers were placed in our world to be the uplifters. And for Tanya and me that\u2019s in our blood. We want people to come to our shows and go away feeling overwhelmed by hope.\u201d As for their marriage, 12 years on, it just keeps getting better. \u201cOur game now is who can outdo each other in that department,\u201d says Michael. \u201c\u2018You bring me home flowers?

With a chihuahua called Diamond Baby kennelled in her designer handbag, this nepotistic partygoer juggled five mobile phones while cantering across continents to sell branded merchandise to the fans she smarmily addresses as \u201cmy Little Hiltons\u201d. Now, in her early 40s, she has published a memoir, which for ephemeral, unreflective celebrities like her is usually a way of fending off imminent obsolescence. The book \u2013 ventriloquised by Joni Rodgers, who describes herself as a \u201cstory whisperer\u201d \u2013 is as vapid and vaporous as the fragrances Hilton sells; all the same, archaeologists may one day consult it in the hope of understanding how and why our species underwent a final mutation into something glossily post-human. The antics of this entitled flibbertigibbet expose the absurdity of a culture in which the self only exists if it is validated by a selfie, membership of society depends on the mirage of social media and the reality in which we were all once anchored has been replaced by a flimsy virtual replica. The high-pitched tale begins in midair above Las Vegas, with a hungover Hilton sky-diving at dawn after \u201cthe greatest 21st birthday celebration since Marie Antoinette\u201d (a precursor whose fate she should bear in mind). Freefalling through an empty sky, Hilton recognises that she is a gilded speck of dust, buffeted by angry winds and plummeting towards annihilation. Then, once her parachute opens, she relaxes into an ecstatic state of grace, \u201csuspended above the desert like a diamond on a delicate silver chain\u201d. Her tumble becomes the descent of a biblical dove or perhaps the Virgin Mary\u2019s assumption in reverse; artfully envisaged as a piece of expensive jewellery, it convinces her that she is an astral phenomenon. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Hilton insists, \u201cpretending to be, like, the Dalai Lama in Louboutins\u201d, but there\u2019s a dizzy spirituality to her account of following what she calls \u201cmy bliss\u201d and her rhapsodies about the beauty of the cosmic design. She later gabbles about \u201cgoing on this trip with the Dalai Lama and a bunch of other people\u201d: did she take His Holiness to party in Ibiza? Christ is invited to join her entourage, though his mission is to sprinkle dollar bills like stardust and instantly fulfil all wishes. \u201cI made the ask,\u201d Hilton tells us after suffering a few seconds of self-doubt, \u201cand like Jesus said, ask and it shall be given unto you.\u201d Schooled by the saviour, she drifts through the crowd at the Coachella Neon Carnival carrying a glitzy cluster of cheap tiaras \u201cso I can gift them as the spirit moves me\u201d. In the religion for which Paris evangelises, cosmetic pampering takes the place of prayer. \u201cSkin care is sacred,\u201d she declares in italics and she supplements the decalogue that Moses brought down from the mountain by adding her own 11th commandment: this recommends a slathering of sunscreen, her equivalent to extreme unction. \u201cWellness as an act of love\u201d is another of her slogans, with a day spa as its tabernacle. But she is sceptical about a heavenly reward for which you can only qualify by dying: after escaping from a series of reformatories set up to discipline bratty teenagers, she calculates the price of salvation and decides that \u201ca hundred million dollars would make me feel safe\u201d. Although she hobnobs with the Dalai Lama and expects Christ to make her mercenary dreams come true, Hilton truly belongs in Greek myth, where flighty nymphs are plucked from the Earth by lecherous gods and installed among the stars in return for their sexual favours. At the end of the book, portioning out her wisdom in bullet points, she suggests that we can elevate ourselves to immortality with no need for divine intervention. \u201cSee yourself,\u201d she counsels, \u201cas part of a galaxy.\u201d This air-headed mysticism merges with the digital revolution, which allowed Hilton to disseminate her image around the globe and to seep into our defenceless heads. She defines her success electronically, theorising that \u201cI was an amplifier and attention was the power cord\u201d that made her \u201ca marketable commodity\u201d. Cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse are another void into which she hurls herself, as if repeating that leap from the plane above Las Vegas: \u201cI jumped in,\u201d she says, \u201cwithout hesitation.\u201d \u201cEverything I do is tied up in swiftly advancing technology,\u201d she confides, referring to her sideline as a DJ and to the \u201cproduct development\u201d that turned her into \u201ca corporate-branding diva\u201d; she might also have mentioned the sex tape in which, thanks to a camera that could see in the dark, she thrashed about in bed with a poker player she was dating. Commercialised despite her protests, the tape was bizarrely dedicated to the victims of 9/11 with a solemn vow that \u201cwe will never forget\u201d. It certainly ensured that we never forgot Hilton, whose clitoris became clickbait and who subsequently embraced Twitter as her \u201cADHD wet dream\u201d. At one point, Hilton remembers that \u201cmy mom threw an epic, epic party\u201d. Like the yapping of a chihuahua, that adjective obsessively recurs, applied to lobsters liberated from a supermarket tank in a juvenile game, to a product launch for Juicy Couture, to her quest for true love and to anything else that takes her fancy. She has good reason for her constant recourse to the inflationary word. Like such classical epics as The Iliad or The Aeneid, this memoir is a saga of territorial conquest. To consolidate her triumph, Hilton is currently starting a family: having hired a surrogate to do the obstetric chores, she regrets missing out on a new wardrobe of \u201camazing maternity looks\u201d and has no Beyonc\u00e9 belly to document in selfies, but she keeps busy by scanning the map for cities, states and countries after which her offspring might be named. Her forthcoming son will be called Phoenix; any future daughter is to be christened London, which warns us of possible annexation. Yes, it\u2019s her world and after reading her book I just wish I could move off-planet. Paris: The Memoir by Paris Hilton is published by HQ (\u00a320).

One tweeted: \u201cClubcard just became less of a reason to be loyal to the store, will be moving our shop to an alternative instead. Thanks for the memories Tesco.\u201d Another wrote: \u201cWe were always grateful for the Tesco Clubcard X4 when our kids were younger, it helped out massively on days out, we used our vouchers to buy towards Merlin passes which saved us so much money. We use it now for ourselves and X3 is good, but what an insult X2 is to customers!\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s and Boots also cut the value of loyalty schemes recently. From May, Boots Advantage card holders will get 25% less for every pound they spend in store, collecting 3p rather than 4p. Sainsbury\u2019s angered customers in 2015 when it halved the number of points they could collect on their Nectar cards, to one point for every \u00a31 spent at the supermarket. In November, Sainsbury\u2019s Bank slashed the number of Nectar points customers could earn by 75%, from two points for every \u00a31 spent, to one point for every \u00a32. In an email to customers, the Tesco chief customer officer, Alessandra Bellini, said the move would \u201cmake sure we can continue to provide you with a wide range of exciting rewards, while keeping our product prices low\u201d.

Those words, spoken as she perched like an avenging angel by the Magimix in my parents\u2019 kitchen, were her verdict on how I was shaping up. Megan as she was then \u2013 she switched to her middle name, Ennea, at 18 \u2013 had been dealt a rough hand. She had lost her mum aged six, her dad when she was 11, and was now living with my sixtysomething parents \u2013 who were off having a little breather for a week. Beforehand, I had been excited. My friends and I were still largely footloose. Children had novelty and anecdote-in-the-pub value. Perhaps even a little cachet? This will be great, I thought. I\u2019ll spend a week being, you know, sage and cool and firm and fair. More fool me, as they say. She didn\u2019t want to go to school \u2013 she had a cold and school was horrible \u2013 but I said she had to. She wasn\u2019t interested in my peppy exploration of negative numbers. Why couldn\u2019t I just do her maths homework, as quickly as possible, so she could watch television? And why wouldn\u2019t I sleep in her room? The house was old and creaky and scary. What was the big deal? Why wouldn\u2019t I? It got worse. On the Thursday, all jolly-jolly, I said it was movie night. I said we should watch Thelma &amp; Louise, picturing a wholesome lesson in female solidarity. She wanted to watch something else. I pressed play on my choice. Now, Thelma &amp; Louise is obviously amazing. I was nearly 14 when I first watched it, just about old enough to process the ugliness of the attempted rape scene near the start. Megan was too young. I realised I had made a mistake, but didn\u2019t turn it off. I didn\u2019t say: \u201cLook, sorry, I\u2019m being a massive idiot, let\u2019s watch your trashy film instead and I\u2019ll sleep in your room. Let\u2019s sack off school tomorrow, because it\u2019s just a day. And who knows what I\u2019m ever going to be to you, but one thing\u2019s for sure, I\u2019m not your keeper, so I\u2019ll just back right up, shall I?\u201d Why didn\u2019t I? Because I thought I was doing the right and proper thing, along with all the other right and proper things: the right A-levels, the right university, the right graduate scheme. But this thing \u2013 doing right by my little cousin \u2013 this I properly sucked at. Driving her home from school the next day, up a long, winding hill, I had to stop at a T-junction on the lip of a steep slope. I attempted a hill-start, but stalled. I tried again. Stalled again. And again \u2013 and again \u2013 and again. A Land Rover behind honked, swerved round us and roared off into the distance. Again I tried. She was in fits of hysterics. Laughing at myself wasn\u2019t my strongest suit back then, but pretty soon I was in hysterics, too. It took me, and I swear I\u2019m not exaggerating, 24 goes to get the car to bite. And with that, something between us reset. I could no longer cosplay the omniscient grownup. I was just a klutz who couldn\u2019t work a clutch. That night she wanted to make us a three-course meal \u2013 light candles, use the fancy plates. Idiot-me thought: urgh, mess, hassle, no way. Reset-me said: Yes, sure, great plan, and we\u2019ve never looked back. If we were Russian (I lived there in my mid-20s), I wouldn\u2019t even call her my cousin. I would call her my sister once removed, or just my sister, which is \u2013 luckily \u2013 what she has become. Superficially, like many sisters, removed or otherwise, we\u2019re pretty different. She\u2019s got innate business savvy, fighting post-Brexit red-tape to start Whim, her ethical swimwear brand. I\u2019m a writer, AKA a business wormhole. She\u2019s got an innate sense of style. I\u2019m winning if I\u2019m washed. And she\u2019s got innate zest, fizzing at parties on nothing stronger than elderflower cordial. I\u2019m an inveterate gen-X boozer. But none of that matters. As soon as I stopped trying to be the boss of her, we started to have fun together \u2013 and that is what we\u2019ve been doing ever since. We\u2019re even neighbours. In fact, we just walked our dogs together. She told me the day\u2019s gossip.

To celebrate the Balinese New Year, known as Nyepi, the island\u2019s usually busy streets have fallen quiet with residents and tourists expected to remain indoors for a day of quiet self-reflection. Reminiscent of recent lockdowns around the globe, and unlike any other New Year celebrations, the traditional start of the Balinese Saka calendar is welcomed with several days of island-wide rituals which centre around a day of silence. To mark Nyepi, everything from the Ngurah Rai International Airport to local supermarkets and ATMs are closed. Lasting 24 hours from 6am on 22 March, island residents and visitors are expected to shun entertainment, work, travel and even artificial light. The pecalang, a type of traditional Balinese security, patrol the streets to ensure that everyone \u2013 including tourists \u2013 complies. Balinese see Nyepi as a way to deter any returning evil spirits. To avoid attracting negative energy and embrace a purified start to the year, stay-at-home orders are put in place. Tourists and digital nomads that rely on good wifi tend to leave for Bali\u2019s neighbouring islands during this time. However, many among those that remain embrace the festival. \u201cI feel really lucky that I get to experience this because it\u2019s a really beautiful day,\u201d said Lotus Vrijma, 29, a Dutch traveller in Ubud. \u201cIt\u2019s special to know that you\u2019re doing it with so many other people on this island.\u201d \u201cI was shocked at how \u2018turned off\u2019 the island really is,\u201d fellow traveller Jackie Colello, 26, explained. She was looking forward to a day of self-contemplation and meditation from her Canggu guesthouse. While Indonesia is a majority Muslim country that will also mark the start of Ramadan on Wednesday, Bali\u2019s population is predominantly Hindu. The island largely practices a specific form of Balinese Hinduism that incorporates teachings from Buddhism as well as the worship of local deities. As a result, the island enjoys its own unique set of annual celebrations and festivities often featuring colourful parades and offerings. While the day provides a special moment of respite for the populous island, the run-up to Nyepi has been far from peaceful. There were busy scenes and long waits at supermarkets as people raced to gather supplies. Phone providers confirmed that cell service would be limited and many ATMs went out of service before Nyepi started. On the eve of the festival, Bali\u2019s communities held a parade to cleanse the island of evil spirits. Officially returning for its second year after pandemic restrictions were lifted, local groups had spent weeks constructing \u201cOgoh-Ogoh\u201d effigies that were paraded through Bali\u2019s dark streets before being burned in dramatic ceremonies. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have this slow day \u2026 in life, you need to have a pause,\u201d said Java native, Livia Ellen.

Prince William became the first member of the royal family to meet troops in Poland during a visit that was kept secret until after his arrival. He will also meet the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, while in the country. At an air defence military base in the south-eastern Polish city of Rzesz\u00f3w, he thanked British troops who are based roughly an hour\u2019s drive from the Ukrainian border for \u201cdefending our freedoms\u201d. He said their work to keep \u201can eye on\u201d the situation in Ukraine was \u201creally important\u201d. After arriving at the base on Wednesday afternoon, the prince, dressed casually in a black puffer jacket and trousers, was shown a missile launcher. Speaking to the soldiers, he said: \u201cI just wanted to come here in person to say thank you for all that you\u2019re doing, keeping everyone safe out here and keeping an eye on what\u2019s going on. So, just a big thank you for what you do on a day-to-day basis.\u201d He added: \u201cYou\u2019re doing a really important job out here and defending our freedoms is really important, and everyone back home thoroughly supports you.\u201d The base, made up of a coalition of British, Polish and US troops, is helping to support Ukraine. Major Richard Kaye, who met the prince, said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to protect critical national infrastructure in the region. We\u2019re absolutely privileged to host His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and privileged that he\u2019s chosen to come and visit us.\u201d William also visited Polish soldiers at the 3rd Brigade Territorial Defence Force base in Rzesz\u00f3w. He will later travel to an accommodation centre in Warsaw to meet Ukrainian refugees who have found sanctuary in the Polish capital. Landing in Warsaw, the prince said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to be back in Poland. Our nations have strong ties. Through our cooperation in support of the people of Ukraine and their freedom, which are also our freedoms and yours, these ties are further strengthened. \u201cI\u2019m here because I want to personally thank the Polish and British troops working in close and crucial partnership. I also want to pay tribute to the inspiring humanity of the Polish people. You have opened your hearts as much as your homes. That\u2019s why this afternoon I visited Rzesz\u00f3w to meet troops based there to hear their stories and recognise their duty. \u201cI was struck by their passion as well as their shared determination to defend our shared freedoms.\u201d The accommodation centre houses about 300 women and children who have arrived in the country recently, providing residents with two meals a day and offers Polish language lessons, employment support, a children\u2019s play area, psychological support and kickboxing classes. William will hear from residents about their experiences before meeting volunteers. He spoke of wanting to \u201cunderline\u201d his continued support and gratitude to the Polish people. On Thursday, the prince will meet Duda at the presidential palace and visit a local food hall to speak with Ukrainian refugees. He will also lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a monument dedicated to Polish soldiers who lost their lives in conflict. The late Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh laid a wreath during their state visit to Poland in 1996.

Barber is at home in Australia; I\u2019m in the UK, where it\u2019s 6am. I\u2019d been intending to have only a half-pint the night before and, well, the next minute, I am being woken up by my ringing phone. The first thing Barber says to me when I crash-land into the call is how good my bedhead looks: \u201cThat\u2019s not fair! You look amazing!\u201d she says, in the booster-ish way of your best friend. That\u2019s Celeste Barber for you: exactly who you\u2019d want to run into when your day is off to a bad start. The actor and \u201ccomedy queen\u201d has accumulated an audience of 9.4 million people on Instagram for her warm, down-to-earth, tells-it-like-it-is brand of humour. In particular Barber made her name by parodying the absurd outfits and awkward poses female celebrities routinely contort themselves into on Instagram. (Think: Barber trying to look sexy in a hammock, copying Kendall Jenner; or chugging a can of Pepsi in a self-conscious approximation of Cindy Crawford.) She started the social media series (#celestechallengeaccepted) in 2015, after steady work in TV as an actor and writer \u2013 including roles in The Matty Johns Show, the medical drama All Saints and the ABC series How Not to Behave. The parodies reliably went viral, gaining Barber many A-lister followers and launching her comedy career. She has since performed standup, written a satirical guide to \u201cbecoming an anti It-girl\u201d and two children\u2019s books, and collaborated on skits on social media for causes as disparate as the luxury fashion house Tom Ford and fundraising for bushfire relief. Last year she toured the UK and Europe, selling out most shows, for which Barber credits her engaged Instagram following \u2013 or as she calls them, \u201cher ladies\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re so good to me,\u201d she says. \u201cInstagram is one thing \u2026 how that would translate to buying a ticket is a different story.\u201d The theme across Barber\u2019s work, down to her very body \u2013 smaller than the average Australian woman, but bigger than most permitted a public profile \u2013 is that she is not a celebrity, but one of us: relatable above all else. Wellmania may change that, as Barber\u2019s first major on-screen role since becoming Insta-famous. The series is very loosely based on the nonfiction book of the same name by my former Guardian Australia colleague Brigid Delaney about her intrepid personal journey through the wellness industry. Delaney co-created the series with Benjamin Law. Barber, who also served as executive producer, had been approached about a potential adaptation before Netflix was even attached. \u201cI read the book and I was like, \u2018This is a brilliant idea\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI love Brigid\u2019s writing: she\u2019s very clever, very personable \u2013 and funny! Really funny \u2013 so I was on board from the beginning.\u201d It being half-five in Australia, Barber has a glass of red to hand \u2013 a natural pinot noir, she clarifies, a little shamefaced. \u201cI said to my husband: \u2018Well, we are these pricks now, who only drink organic wine.\u2019\u201d To be fair, it is better, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s better tomorrow as well,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t hurt as much.\u201d It is those sorts of topics that the book Wellmania explores: how to make both the pub and your early morning interview; how to have three glasses of wine but not feel them the next day; how to have your gluten-free cake and eat it too. Barber was drawn to Delaney\u2019s experiential and even-handed approach to the topical world of wellness and all its potential cures. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to poke fun at it \u2013 I\u2019ve made a career out of it \u2013 but this is a multibillion industry that can save lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of it might not be a fad \u2013 it might actually be quite good \u2013 but sometimes it is just bullshit. \u201cThe wellness industry is like the new form of church or organised religion: a lot of people find answers in it. It\u2019s so big, and so vast, you can pick and choose what helps you.\u201d The series Wellmania is a scripted fictional treatment inspired by those themes. Barber plays Liv Healy, an Australian lifestyle journalist and \u201chuman tornado\u201d working hard and playing hard in New York. On a dash back home for her friend\u2019s 40th, Liv finds herself stranded in Sydney by a health crisis, jeopardising the job of a lifetime back in the States. She will try anything to get well enough to fly, from colonics to cardio \u2013 anything except confront the costs of being permanently on the go. Liv is a more nuanced character than the hot mess that she might initially appear. She\u2019s self-involved, chaotic and outspoken, and sometimes thoughtless with it \u2013 especially at the expense of her friends and family (played by JJ Fong, Genevieve Mooy, Lachlan Buchanan, Remy Hii and Alexander Hodge). But she\u2019s also loyal, caring and resourceful. \u201cShe\u2019s really ambitious, she\u2019s really good at what she does, she\u2019s sought-after internationally \u2013 and a hot mess,\u201d says Barber. If Liv has a fatal flaw, it is her inability to accept her mortal limits \u2013 something many of us can relate to. Barber is conscious of it herself, having turned 40 last year. \u201cShe treats her body like an amusement park, this character, and she\u2019s at that stage in her life where you just fucking can\u2019t any more,\u201d she says, with knowing exasperation. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s relatable: whether you like it or not, you have to reassess.\u201d In its preoccupation with having it all, and looking good while doing it, Wellmania is a very Sydney show. It fondly sends up the city\u2019s culture of cocaine-and-green juice and \u201cleather-wearing vegans\u201d, Barber says. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing about wellness: a lot of it is for the elite, the privileged. A lot of it is \u2018Buy this $45 water bottle and it will make your husband not leave you\u2019.\u201d Barber wields that same bullshit detector on social media, highlighting the gap between Instagram and reality; and the money to be made by stoking women\u2019s anxieties. \u201cOn Instagram, I\u2019m making fun of [or] cutting down, cutting through the bullshit that is the body-shaming industry. The beauty industry, the fashion industry \u2013 I just don\u2019t fuck around with that \u2013 I think it\u2019s bullshit; I\u2019m having a go.\u201d Her comedy aims to provoke, and often succeeds. Cindy Crawford recently responded to Barber\u2019s parody of her infamous Pepsi commercial with cry-laughing emojis. Model and writer Emily Ratajkowski was less magnanimous, blocking Barber for mocking her nearly naked photoshoot. Barber shrugged it off at the time (\u201cI like running my mouth off\u201d) but her parodies have also drawn criticism for singling out individual women rather than the sexist systems they are operating within. Already there are signs her everywoman-in-a-string-bikini shtick may have a shelf life. A splashy 2019 magazine photoshoot of Barber alongside actor and activist Jameela Jamil, in particular, seemed to be more mocking than self-effacing; and in January she drew some criticism for a swimsuit spread in Marie Claire that appeared to have been heavily airbrushed. Either way, as Barber\u2019s star rises it brings her into ever-closer contact with the gendered glitz and showbiz shallowness she\u2019s spent the best part of a decade poking fun at. \u201cI always feel like I\u2019m a model; I just don\u2019t think anyone else has ever caught on to it,\u201d Barber jokes. But it\u2019s true, she says, \u201cthere has been a shift in how what I do on Instagram is perceived\u201d. Her aim has always been to make people laugh, Barber says \u2013 but in recent years she has found herself going easier on her targets. \u201cI think subconsciously, I\u2019ve been a little bit lighter with the content that I create, going purely for \u2018this is funny\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that I also have a profile and I\u2019m now entering into that space \u2026 But a lot of the time it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m going to look stupid doing this \u2013 and that\u2019s hilarious.\u2019\u201d Barber never intended to be a body-positivity advocate, she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s a movement I\u2019m very happy to be part of\u201d. She recalls a woman telling her that her daughter had replaced posters of \u201cgorgeous, skinny models\u201d on her bedroom walls with pictures of Barber. \u201cThat makes me so happy \u2013 and that\u2019s why I went on the cover of magazines.\u201d Too often, she says, women are given an either-or choice. Wellmania, the TV series, asks what it really means to be well \u2013 sustainably, not through quick fixes or a total transformation. For Barber, who has two young sons and ageing parents, the question feels especially relevant. \u201cIt\u2019s at the forefront of my mind, making sure that I am on top of my health, my mental health, my relationship, all of it. It\u2019s not like Liv: go-go-go-go-go-go, until you explode.\u201d Barber herself strives for balance \u2013 a bit of yoga to clear her head and, likewise, an after-work wine \u2013 and to take what works for her, and to leave the rest. \u201cThat\u2019s the curiosity of the wellness industry, isn\u2019t it: some of it might save your life \u2013 but not that $45 water bottle.\u201d Sympathetic, again, with my early start, Barber suggests I begin with a coffee. \u2022 Wellmania is on Netflix globally from 29 March \u2022 This article was amended on 22 March 2023 to correct the name of JJ Fong.", "date": "2023-03-22", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Elle Hunt", "id": 41}, {"title": "People in France: tell us about taking part in recent protests", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/people-in-france-pensions-tell-us-about-taking-part-in-recent-protests", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.048, "neu": 0.717, "pos": 0.236, "compound": 0.7059}, "body": "Protesters have gathered across France to demonstrate their opposition to the pension age being raised from 62 to 64, with 200 demonstrations expected on Thursday.

Describing it as a critique of social media and heteronormative relationships, Lamorna Ash in the Guardian called it a \u201ccorrosive, brilliant debut\u201d. Speirs said the judges \u201cloved Patel\u2019s book for its immediacy, vibrancy and shafts of spiky humour\u201d. Sams is the youngest author on this year\u2019s shortlist, at 26, and is shortlisted for her short story collection Send Nudes, which highlights the confusing double standards facing women today. Madeleine Feeny in her Guardian review said Sams presented \u201cacute portraits of the fragile intimacies and euphoric moments snatched by a generation of women coming of age into a precarious future\u201d. Long described Send Nudes as an \u201cexciting, empowering collection of short stories, full of knowing, daring, wit and range\u201d. The list is completed by three international writers: Ireland\u2019s Sara Baume, Australia\u2019s Robbie Arnott, and Nigeria\u2019s Arinze Ifeakandu. Baume is nominated for her poetic third novel Seven Steeples, which depicts a couple escaping into the wilds of south-west Ireland. Barney Norris in the Guardian called it a \u201cglacially beautiful book\u201d. Gower said Baume had \u201ccreated a marvellously shambolic and memorable pair of characters\u201d and described the book as \u201ctender and true\u201d. Arnott is shortlisted for his third novel Limberlost, which transports readers to the Tasmanian wilderness with its story of the life of one man. Melissa Harrison in the Guardian said: \u201cArnott has an eye and an ear for description that can elevate otherwise quiet moments to something genuinely transcendent.\u201d Parajuly said the prize judges loved the book \u201cfor its stunning sentences, its quiet meditation on masculinity, and its ability to conjure up (as well as transport us to) 1940s Tasmania\u201d. Ifeakandu is shortlisted for his short story collection, God\u2019s Children Are Little Broken Things, which explores what it means to be a queer male in his home country. Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, in an interview in the Observer, said it was a \u201ctremendous book\u201d. Shipstead said God\u2019s Children Are Little Broken Things brought \u201cincisive authorial insight and compassionate, compelling humanity to the lives of its characters\u201d.

What\u2019s a night agent, I hear you ask? Well, in this case, he is an FBI agent called Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso), who saves a bunch of ordinary joes from a bomb on a subway train. For some reason, he is put on desk duties in the basement of the White House, doing admin while he waits by a helpline phone that undercover operatives can call to let the powers-that-be know they are in trouble. But that darn phone never rings. Peter does his admin conscientiously, but you know that in his heart of hearts he would like some thrills \u2013 maybe even of a political nature. As luck would have it, across town, a (professional and romantic) couple of undercover operatives are in trouble. Just before they have to fight for their lives \u2013 but just after we hear them whispering about a possible Russian mole in the White House \u2013 they dispatch their niece Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) to a phone down the street to call \u2026 yes. The phone! The phone! While our undercover lovers are being killed, the president\u2019s chief-of-staff, Diane Farr (Hong Chau), puts Peter in charge of keeping Rose safe. \u201cIf she called your number, this is more important than you can imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cI trust you completely.\u201d I have many questions about this (and more about why they chose to put a 43-year-old actor in such a cheap grey wig, like the Witch of Endor in a business suit), but there is no time to ask, because more plot is happening! The script is finding its feet as we go! This includes two car chases, much shooting, some running out of bullets, a safe house, a gun safe in a coffee table, a villain with a ring bearing the crest of the Royal House of Yugoslavia that Peter suspects may be a clue, villains without any rings, and a particularly ruthless Bonnie and Clyde couple, possibly of Russian extraction. This is all before Rose tells Peter that Aunt and Uncle Spy were worried there was a mole in the White House. Now, they can trust no one and have to go rogue. It is propulsive, slicker-than-slick fun, with every hairpin turn perfectly negotiated. There are fine performances \u2013 especially from Basso, who is getting two or three notes out of what could easily have been a one-note part. It gives you that warm feeling you get when you come across something a little bit better than it needs to be. You could not ask for more out of your adaptation of a bestselling political thriller about a night agent. I feel as if I am about one and a half measures of plot away from losing the thread entirely, but I feel like that a lot. The showrunner is Shawn Ryan, most recently responsible for the show S.W.A.T., but who was also behind one of the cleverest, most underrated police series of recent decades. The Shield was an extraordinary creation \u2013 brilliant long and short narrative arcs examining the corruption of the system and the soul, excellent performances \u2013 not just from the mainstays such as Michael Chiklis, Jay Karnes and Walton Goggins, but also from guest stars such as Forest Whitaker, who was unforgettable \u2013 and characters of a complexity to rival anything in The Wire. I wonder how much Ryan longs to get his teeth into something like that again? You couldn\u2019t blame him if he was still, 15 years on, recovering from seven seasons of interrogating all the ways men can brutalise each other. And their cats. (If you know, you know. Goddamn, Dutch \u2026) Anyway, The Night Agent is set fair to deliver a lot of bang for your 10-episode buck. I think the mole is hiding under Diane\u2019s wig. Also, now that I have realised whom Basso reminds me of (a finer-featured Richard Madden in Bodyguard), I can hopefully concentrate a bit better and not lose the thread of things until maybe three or even four episodes in. I look forward to finding out. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 March 2023 to correct the first name of actor Walton Goggins.

And there has never been a time we\u2019ve needed his dismal optimism more. It\u2019s hard to read an article or listen to a podcast these days without doomsayers telling us we\u2019ve pushed our luck with artificial intelligence, our hubris is coming back to haunt us and robots are taking over the world. There are stories of chatbots becoming best friends, declaring their love, trying to disrupt stable marriages, and threatening chaos on a global scale. Is AI really capable of outsmarting us and taking over the world? \u201cOK! Well, your question makes no sense,\u201d Lanier says in his gentle sing-song voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve just used the set of terms that to me are fictions. I\u2019m sorry to respond that way, but it\u2019s ridiculous \u2026 it\u2019s unreal.\u201d This is the stuff of sci-fi movies such as The Matrix and Terminator, he says. Lanier doesn\u2019t even like the term artificial intelligence, objecting to the idea that it is actually intelligent, and that we could be in competition with it. \u201cThis idea of surpassing human ability is silly because it\u2019s made of human abilities.\u201d He says comparing ourselves with AI is the equivalent of comparing ourselves with a car. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying a car can go faster than a human runner. Of course it can, and yet we don\u2019t say that the car has become a better runner.\u201d I flush and smile. Flush because I\u2019m embarrassed, smile because I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019ll take my bollocking happily, I say. He squeals with laughter. \u201cHehehehe! OK. Hehehehe!\u201d But he doesn\u2019t want us to get complacent. There\u2019s plenty left to worry about: human extinction remains a distinct possibility if we abuse AI, and even if it\u2019s of our own making, the end result is no prettier. Lanier, 62, has worked alongside many of the web\u2019s visionaries and power-brokers. He is both insider (he works at Microsoft as an interdisciplinary scientist, although he makes it clear that today he is talking on his own behalf) and outsider (he has constantly, and presciently, exposed the dangers the web presents). He is also one of the most distinctive men on the planet \u2013 a raggedy prophet with ginger dreads, a startling backstory, an eloquence to match his gargantuan brain and a giggle as alarming as it is life-enhancing. Although a tech guru in his own right, his mission is to champion the human over the digital \u2013 to remind us we created the machines, and artificial intelligence is just what it says on the tin. In books such as You Are Not a Gadget and Ten Reasons For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts, he argues that the internet is deadening personal interaction, stifling inventiveness and perverting politics. We meet on Microsoft\u2019s videoconference platform Teams so that he can show a recent invention of his that enables us to appear in the same room together even though we are thousands of miles apart. But the technology isn\u2019t working in the most basic sense. He can\u2019t see me. Doubtless he\u2019ll be pleased in a way. There\u2019s nothing Lanier likes more than showing technology can go wrong, especially when operated by an incompetent at the other end. So we switch to the rival Zoom. Lanier\u2019s backdrop is full of musical instruments, including a row of ouds hanging from the ceiling. In his other life, he is a professional contemporary classical musician \u2013 a brilliant player of rare and ancient instruments. Often he has used music to explain the genius and limitations of tech. At its simplest, digital technology works in a on/off way, like the keys on a keyboard, and lacks the endless variety of a saxophone or human voice. \u201cFrom my perspective,\u201d he says, \u201cthe danger isn\u2019t that a new alien entity will speak through our technology and take over and destroy us. To me the danger is that we\u2019ll use our technology to become mutually unintelligible or to become insane if you like, in a way that we aren\u2019t acting with enough understanding and self-interest to survive, and we die through insanity, essentially.\u201d Now I\u2019m feeling less relieved. Death by insanity doesn\u2019t sound too appealing, and it can come in many forms \u2013 from world leaders or terrorists screwing with global security AI to being driven bonkers by misinformation or bile on Twitter. Lanier says the more sophisticated technology becomes, the more damage we can do with it, and the more we have a \u201cresponsibility to sanity\u201d. In other words, a responsibility to act morally and humanely. Lanier was the only child of Jewish parents who knew all about inhumanity. His Viennese mother was blond and managed to talk her way out of a concentration camp by passing as Aryan. She then moved to the US, working as a pianist and stocks trader. His father, whose family had been largely wiped out in Ukrainian pogroms, had a range of jobs from architect to science editor of pulp science-fiction magazines and eventually elementary-school teacher. Lanier was born in New York, but the family soon moved west. When he was nine, his mother was killed after her car flipped over on the freeway on her way back from passing her driving test. Both father and son were left traumatised and impoverished; his mother had been the main breadwinner. The two of them moved to New Mexico, living in tents before 11-year-old Lanier started to design their new house, a geodesic dome that took seven years to complete. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good structurally, but it was good therapeutically,\u201d he says. In his 2017 memoir, Dawn of the New Everything, Lanier wrote that the house looked \u201ca little like a woman\u2019s body. You could see the big dome as a pregnant belly and the two icosahedrons as breasts.\u201d He was ludicrously bright. At 14, he enrolled at New Mexico State University, taking graduate-level courses in mathematical notation, which led him to computer programming. He never completed his degree, but went to art school and flunked out. By the age of 17 he was working a number of jobs, including goat-keeper, cheese-maker and assistant to a midwife. Then, by his early 20s, he had became a researcher for Atari in California. When he was made redundant, he focused on virtual reality projects, co-founding VPL Research to commercialise VR technologies. He could have easily been a tech billionaire had he sold his businesses sensibly or at least shown a little interest in money. As it stands, he tells me he has done very nicely financially, and obscene wealth wouldn\u2019t have sat with his values. Today, he lives in Santa Cruz in California with his wife and teenage daughter. Although many of the digital gurus started out as idealists, to Lanier there was an inevitability that the internet would screw us over. We wanted stuff for free (information, friendships, music), but capitalism doesn\u2019t work like that. So we became the product \u2013 our data sold to third parties to sell us more things we don\u2019t need. \u201cI wrote something that described how what we now call bots will be turned into these agents of manipulation. I wrote that in the early 90s when the internet had barely been turned on.\u201d He squeals with horror and giggles. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s 30 years ago!\u201d Actually, he believes bots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard could provide hope for the digital world. Lanier was always dismayed that the internet gave the appearance of offering infinite options but in fact diminished choice. Until now, the primary use of AI algorithms has been to choose what videos we would like to see on YouTube, or whose posts we\u2019ll see on social media platforms. Lanier believes it has made us lazy and incurious. Beforehand, we would sift through stacks in a record shop or browse in bookshops. \u201cWe were directly connected to a choice base that was actually larger instead of being fed this thing through this funnel that somebody else controls.\u201d Take the streaming platforms, he says. \u201cNetflix once had a million-dollar prize contest to improve their algorithm, to help people sort through this gigantic space of streaming options. But it has never had that many choices. The truth is you could put all of Netflix\u2019s streaming content on one scrollable page. This is another area where we have a responsibility to sanity, he says \u2013 not to narrow our options or get trapped in echo chambers, slaves to the algorithm. That\u2019s why he loves playing live music \u2013 because every time he jams with a band, he creates something new. For Lanier, the classic example of restricted choice is Wikipedia, which has effectively become the world\u2019s encyclopedia. \u201cWikipedia is run by super-nice people who are my friends. But the thing is it\u2019s like one encyclopedia. Some of us might remember when on paper there was both an Encyclopedia Britannica and Encyclopedia Americana and they provided different perspectives. The notion of having the perfect encyclopedia is just weird.\u201d So could the new chatbots challenge this? \u201cRight. That\u2019s my point. If you go to a chatbot and say: \u2018Please can you summarise the state of the London tube?\u2019 you\u2019ll get different answers each time. And then you have to choose.\u201d This programmed-in randomness, he says, is progress. \u201cAll of a sudden this idea of trying to make the computer seem humanlike has gone far enough in this iteration that we might have naturally outgrown this illusion of the monolithic truth of the internet or AI. It means there is a bit more choice and discernment and humanity back with the person who\u2019s interacting with the thing.\u201d That\u2019s all well and good, but what about AI replacing us in the workplace? We already have the prospect of chatbots writing articles like this one. Again, he says it\u2019s not the technology that replaces us, it\u2019s how we use it. \u201cThere are two ways this could go. One is that we pretend the bot is a real thing, a real entity like a person, then in order to keep that fantasy going we\u2019re careful to forget whatever source texts were used to have the bot function. Journalism would be harmed by that. The other way is you do keep track of where the sources came from. And in that case a very different world could unfold where if a bot relied on your reporting, you get payment for it, and there is a shared sense of responsibility and liability where everything works better. The term for that is data dignity.\u201d It seems too late for data dignity to me; the dismal optimist is in danger of being a utopian optimist here. But Lanier soon returns to Planet Bleak. \u201cYou can use AI to make fake news faster, cheaper and on greater scales. That combination is where we might see our extinction.\u201d In You Are Not a Gadget, he wrote that the point of digital technology was to make the world more \u201ccreative, expressive, empathic and interesting\u201d. Has it achieved that? \u201cIt has in some cases. There\u2019s a lot of cool stuff on the internet. I think TikTok is dangerous and should be banned yet I love dance culture on TikTok and it should be cherished.\u201d Why should it be banned? \u201cBecause it\u2019s controlled by the Chinese, and should there be difficult circumstances there are lots of horrible tactical uses it could be put to. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an acceptable risk. It\u2019s heartbreaking because a lot of kids love it for perfectly good reasons.\u201d As for Twitter, he says it has brought out the worst in us. \u201cIt has a way of taking people who start out as distinct individuals and converging them into the same personality, optimised for Twitter engagement. That personality is insecure and nervous, focused on personal slights and affronted by claims of rights by others if they\u2019re different people. The example I use is Trump, Kanye and Elon [Musk, who now owns Twitter]. Ten years ago they had distinct personalities. But they\u2019ve converged to have a remarkable similarity of personality, and I think that\u2019s the personality you get if you spend too much time on Twitter. It turns you into a little kid in a schoolyard who is both desperate for attention and afraid of being the one who gets beat up. You end up being this phoney who\u2019s self-concerned but loses empathy for others.\u201d It\u2019s a brilliant analysis that returns to his original point \u2013 our responsibility to sanity. Does Lanier\u2019s responsibility to his own sanity keep him off social media? He smiles. \u201cI always thought social media was bullshit. It was obviously just this dumb thing from the beginning.\u201d There is much about the internet of which he is still proud. He says that virtual reality headsets now used are little different from those he introduced in the 1980s, and his work on surgical simulation has had huge practical benefits. \u201cI know many people whose lives have been saved by the furtherance of this stuff I was demonstrating 40 years ago. My God! I\u2019m so old now!\u201d He stops to question whether he\u2019s overstating his influence, stressing that he was only involved at the beginning. There is also huge potential, he says, for AI to help us tackle climate change, and save the planet. But he has also seen the very worst of AI. \u201cI know people whose kids have committed suicide with a very strong online algorithm contribution. So in those cases life was taken. It might not be possible from this one human perspective to say for sure what the giant accounting ledger would tell us now, but whatever that answer would be I\u2019m certain we could have done better, and I\u2019m sure we can and must do better in the future.\u201d Again, that word, human. The way to ensure that we are sufficiently sane to survive is to remember it\u2019s our humanness that makes us unique, he says. \u201cA lot of modern enlightenment thinkers and technical people feel that there is something old-fashioned about believing that people are special \u2013 for instance that consciousness is a thing. They tend to think there is an equivalence between what a computer could be and what a human brain could be.\u201d Lanier has no truck with this. \u201cWe have to say consciousness is a real thing and there is a mystical interiority to people that\u2019s different from other stuff because if we don\u2019t say people are special, how can we make a society or make technologies that serve people?\u201d Lanier looks at his watch, and apologises. \u201cYou know what, I actually have to go to a dentist\u2019s appointment.\u201d The real world intervenes and asserts its supremacy over the virtual.

When?\u201d He goes: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now.\u201d We walked out with my jaw on the floor and went to some high-class Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills. Al\u2019s like: \u201cCall me Al.\u201d At the end of the lunch, he goes: \u201cMichael, I like him.\u201d Every day on set, I\u2019d go: \u201cHow are you, sir?\u201d Al would put his hand on my shoulder, say: \u201cHenry, not so good,\u201d and tell me in great detail about how he\u2019d pulled a muscle in his arm. He was hilarious to be around. There\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m handcuffed, so Al would sit on a couch and keep me company while I was being unlocked: \u201cSomeone give me a magic marker. I\u2019m gonna draw a moustache on Henry.\u201d When you\u2019re getting razzed by Al Pacino, how bad is your day? Is touring a spoken-word show less stressful than a full-band tour? 2HeadedDog Doing the music was like gladiator sport. I\u2019d lose three pounds of water every show. I\u2019ve ripped up my back and my neck, and my jaw clicks from being smashed around. The talking shows are more demanding, because it\u2019s only me on stage. It\u2019s like comparing surgery with construction \u2013 one requires super concentration and the other is just physical. And on the bus it\u2019s not a tribe of stenchy men! It\u2019s four non-smoking, low-key individuals. Backstage, it\u2019s just me. I heard the sad news about the death of Glen \u201cSpot\u201d Lockett [the influential Black Flag and SST Records producer] . Do you have a story to share, or a favourite album that he produced? HJayJay Spot had a very old-school way of recording: fewer microphones, less mixing, everything live, like he was cutting a Charlie Parker side. My favourite album he did is The Punch Line by Minutemen, from 1981. They were very argumentative, so Spot would go: \u201cOK, that\u2019s the take. Shut up,\u201d and they were smart enough to listen. I\u2019ve never met anyone like him. He would go around for days wearing roller-skates. When Black Flag recorded Damaged, Greg Ginn wanted to hear what it sounded like in the studio, so Spot picked up Greg\u2019s guitar and while the band were playing he absolutely nailed the track Damaged II, which is like math rock. Greg was an astonishing guitarist, but he was totally shut down. It was hilarious. The chess master got checkmated. Your KCRW radio shows are a joy. Which radio DJs inspired and entertained you? VerulamiamParkRanger My mom took me to see American Graffiti and the character Wolfman Jack\u2019s scenes were so charismatic. I became obsessed with the idea of a mystical voice talking through a clock radio at night who saves your life through music. At KCRW, my late, great friend Deirdre O\u2019Donoghue first taught me how to do it. I\u2019ve been on the station for 14 years and my show is listened to all over the world. When you put together your playlist for your radio show, what are you looking for in a new artist? Zenon73 To like their music. That\u2019s it. When I was in a band, I always wanted someone to play us on the radio to help us over the wall, so if someone recommends a new band that I like, I\u2019m all over their Bandcamp and buy their entire catalogue. I love the forthcoming album by Snooper from Nashville. It\u2019s a fun record, all 23 minutes of it. When I was 14, I wrote to all the bands that inspired me. You were one of the few who cared enough to reply. Did you ever write to your heroes? JimKrimson No, but I came from the Washington DC punk scene, which was very egalitarian. When a young person writes to me, I\u2019d never not write back, because I believe in young people. I don\u2019t want to shut down their enthusiasm. What are your memories of your time at 52 Harold Mount, Leeds, and recording those early solo/Rollins Band records at Off Beat Studios? Davehumanfly Chris Haskett from the Rollins Band was living in Leeds, so we made records there and camped out in his freezing flat with a coin-operated meter. The local store served the best onion bhajis I\u2019ve ever had and the owner was forever trying to set Chris up with his daughter. I learned the land of the whole area. We borrowed a mic from the Mekons and we played the Duchess of York several times. One night, some guy said: \u201cJimi Hendrix was basically British.\u201d I went: \u201cRight, sit down. You\u2019re going to get schooled on the state of Washington,\u201d and totally went off on this guy. Your 1994 essay Iron and the Soul, outlining how and why you came to start lifting weights, is up there with Sven Lindqvist\u2019s Bench Press book in redefining reasons for strength training.

I\u2019m onstage for two and a half hours talking at high speed, and this one leg of the tour is 44 shows straight, so that calorie burn in the afternoon prepares me mentally. As a teenager, I couldn\u2019t throw a ball straight and nobody wanted to play with me. My teacher taught me to lift weights and the gym has been my happy place ever since. You have a vast record collection; which record do you have the most versions of? Zenon73 I have lots of different pressings of the first Damned album and the first three Buzzcocks albums. Different pressings of Hendrix albums are interesting, especially the South African ones, because during apartheid they didn\u2019t want a non-white guy\u2019s face on the cover. Bowie 7ins from the Philippines are super hard to find and always in bad condition. I buy every Joy Division bootleg. It\u2019s basically the same eight shows, but until I have every pressing my life is not complete. How did you come to be in possession of the original artwork for the Ruts\u2019 classic 1979 British punk album The Crack? Ferret76 Segs [John Jennings] from the Ruts told me that the painter, John Howard, took it to New York and the band never saw it again. I found John Howard and he told me that he sold it to an art collector who just thought it was a cool picture of a party. He gave me an insanely low price. A while later, Segs told me the back cover artwork had turned up in an auction house in Suffolk, so I bought that as well. Your mention of electric-era Miles Davis triggered my long-time love and obsession. What are you listening to that might be related? MisterFrisky I was raised on Miles, but my mom she said she no longer understood him during the electric era. So, in Rollins Band, my bandmates were amazed I\u2019d never heard On the Corner and sat me down and played it. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything like it, but on the bus my road manager has been playing east European 1970s jazz, so I\u2019ve been tracking down records by all these bands whose names I can\u2019t remember. What are you memories of performing in Ukraine \u2013 and would you perform in Kyiv or Moscow now? surgical Kyiv was really beautiful and the audiences were really thoughtful and appreciative. Russian audiences were always fantastic. Going to Ukraine would be making light of the situation, unless I could afford the flights myself and do a show for free, a sort of tonic for the troops, like I used to do with USO [United Service Organizations, a live-entertainment charity for the US armed forces] in Iraq and Afghanistan. I wouldn\u2019t go to Russia now for fear of something being dropped into my tea. In your recent book Sic, you mentioned that you have moved to Nashville to realise a major project. What is it? Colindardis It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working on for a couple of years with my manager, Heidi May, and I\u2019ve put my life savings into it. All I can say is that we\u2019re looking at launching 14 months from now in Nashville and it will make people smile until their faces hurt. \u2022 Henry Rollins\u2019 UK tour begins on 24 March at De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea", "date": "2023-03-23", "section": "Culture", "author": "As told to Dave Simpson", "id": 46}, {"title": "Hits and myths: why has Hollywood abandoned ancient Greece?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/24/hits-and-myths-why-has-hollywood-abandoned-ancient-greece", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.072, "neu": 0.725, "pos": 0.204, "compound": 0.997}, "body": "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King will be back in North American cinemas next month, to celebrate 20 years since Peter Jackson first debuted his Oscar-winning film. Its return to the multiplexes comes at a time when we seem to have more JRR Tolkien-inspired fantasies to choose from than a 1980s branch of Games Workshop. As well as Gollum and co returning to the big screen, we have the baffling, utterly superfluous yet sumptuously filmed and geekily delightful small screen The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power TV show. Then next year there will be The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, an animated venture with Brian Cox as Helm Hammerhand and Jackson alumnus Miranda Otto as Eowyn (who will take the narrator\u2019s role for the forthcoming prequel about the legendary warrior king of Rohan). We are also promised several new live-action movies based on Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth, after a deal struck by rights holder Embracer Group and studios Warner Bros and New Line. Jackson and his two closest Lord of the Rings collaborators, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, have said they are being kept in the loop \u201cevery step of the way\u201d about the new films. Meanwhile, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is about to hit cinemas, bringing back to the screen the American role-playing franchise inspired by Tolkien. Starring Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez and Hugh Grant, it looks a lot more silly and a lot less po-faced than the Jackson movies, and yet we are still talking about a tale of perky elves, wise wizards and nasty necromancers. If Sam and Frodo turned up halfway through to reveal that a new ring of power had been discovered that gives its user the ability to ride Ents and engage Balrogs in polite conversation, nobody would be the least bit surprised. But wonderful as all this stuff isai, the ubiquity of Tolkienesque drama is overshadowing the fact that this is not the only way to make fantasy movies, or even deliver swords and sorcery on the big screen. When Jackson was a toddler, long before Lord of the Rings had first been adapted for screen (via Ralph Bakshi\u2019s ill-fated 1978 attempt), there was 1963\u2019s Jason and the Argonauts, Don Chaffey\u2019s glorious tale of gods and stop-motion monsters. The scene in which Jason battles seven living skeletons, which apparently took the celebrated stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen months to create, still gives me the willies. The final film Harryhausen worked on, 1981\u2019s Clash of the Titans, had the spine-chilling Medusa scene to equal it. Chaffey\u2019s aim was to bring Greek mythology to life for film audiences, replete with new deities, demigods and other assorted celestial beings. Yet Hollywood seems to have forgotten about this great pantheon of stories that are ripe for the plucking. Where are the soaring, splendid movies \u2013 especially given the remarkable advances in special effects since Harryhausen\u2019s day \u2013 about brave but reckless Theseus and the minotaur, or Bellerophon and Pegasus, the winged horse? Why have the 12 tasks of Heracles been forgotten while Homer\u2019s Odyssey, perhaps the ultimate tale of a fantasy quest, languishes in cinematic obscurity? Perhaps studios think that the abject failure of 2010\u2019s Clash of the Titans remake, and its useless sequel, 2012\u2019s Wrath of the Titans, is reason enough to abandon Mount Olympus. But those movies were directed by Louis Leterrier and Jonathan Liebesman; Lord of the Rings got Jackson and his team. It\u2019s hardly a fair contest. A couple of half-baked Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief movies from the early 00s were not enough to shake up the picture. These days the ancient Greek tales are most likely to inspire comic-book movies. DC\u2019s Wonder Woman is inspired by Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt (though she has been bestowed instead with the deity\u2019s Roman equivalent, Diana) as well as the warrior goddess Athena. Russell Crowe played a fittingly pompous and effete Zeus in the recent Marvel movie Thor: Love and Thunder, while Aquaman has definite shades of Poseidon. But superhero movies about godlike deities often seem to miss out on the gravitas and majesty of the original myths that inspired them, partly because there is a temptation to slip into comedy fish-out-of-water territory when such beings come into contact with 21st-century humanity. I\u2019m not sure I want to see Perseus joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Jason, leader of the Argonauts, battling Batman. But I can imagine both roaring back to big screen glory in all their heroic splendour if their stories were given to a director who is a genuine titan of Hollywood, rather than \u2026 you know \u2026 someone who\u2019s made a few pop videos.", "date": "2023-03-24", "section": "Film", "author": "Ben Child", "id": 47}, {"title": "UK aid cuts could force closure of Afghan project supporting women and girls", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/24/uk-aid-cuts-could-force-closure-of-afghan-project-supporting-women-and-girls", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.106, "neu": 0.682, "pos": 0.212, "compound": 0.9851}, "body": "The UK government has cut almost \u00a36m in funding to a programme in Afghanistan supporting vulnerable women and girls. Save the Children said it has been told by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office that it will receive just over \u00a31m of a promised \u00a37m to support more than 100,000 people to access essential basic services such as healthcare and education. The charity said the year-long programme, which started in December and delivers classes to women and girls across Afghanistan, may now be forced to close this month. Save the Children is scrambling to secure funds to continue the work, which provides a lifeline for many who face the risk of early marriage, violence and other forms of exploitation. Gwen Hines, CEO of Save the Children UK, said: \u201cAfghan children are already dying from hunger and disease, and now face having funding for basic food, health and education programmes withdrawn by the British government. \u201cThe decision to cut millions in funding to Afghan children sends a stark message to the world that the UK is turning its back on the most vulnerable children and families in one of the world\u2019s most challenging contexts. The UK\u2019s rhetoric that it supports women and girls in Afghanistan now rings hollow.\u201d More than 28 million people \u2013 more than half the population \u2013 including 15 million children, are in need of humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan, according to the UN. Since 2019, the total UK aid budget has been cut by \u00a34bn, from 0.7% gross national income (\u00a315.2bn) to 0.5% (\u00a311.4bn) in 2021. As much as a third of the aid budget is now being spent on housing refugees in the UK, which MPs on the international development committee (IDC) have described as \u201cunsustainable\u201d. The IDC had launched a parliamentary inquiry into the impact of the government\u2019s funding cuts on women and girls in low-income countries. The cut to Save the Children\u2019s programme, Supporting Afghanistan\u2019s Basic Services, comes three months after the Taliban issued a decree banning Afghan women from working for NGOs. The charity was among a number of organisations that suspended operations as a result. It has resumed its work after receiving assurances from the authorities that female staff will be safe and can work without obstruction. Last week, the UK government launched its global women and girls strategy promising to \u201cput women and girls at the heart of FCDO\u2019s work\u201d. The FCDO said: \u201cThe UK has disbursed over \u00a3237m of life-saving aid this year alone to the most vulnerable Afghans and will support Save the Children\u2019s work through schemes like the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, the Girls\u2019 Education Challenge, and the Global Partnership for Education. \u201cWe will continue to ensure the UK\u2019s official development assistance funding is allocated where it is most effective, delivering on its aims while providing value for money to the UK taxpayer.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-24", "section": "Global development", "author": "Patrick Wintour", "id": 48}, {"title": "My Kind of Country review \u2013 finally, a music competition show with real heart", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/mar/24/my-kind-of-country-review", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.074, "neu": 0.672, "pos": 0.254, "compound": 0.9959}, "body": "For those of you \u2013 for those of us \u2013 who have been broken on the wheel of secondhand embarrassment over the last few hundred years (or whenever reality TV and singing etc competitions began), My Kind of Country will come as balm to the soul. All the contestants have the goods: they can sing, they can play, they can perform and have in many cases years of experience under their belts. And the judges (country singer-songwriters Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and Orville Peck), who have scouted and champion four contestants each, are there to help not humiliate them. The relief is tremendous, even if you do have to hear an awful lot about hopes, dreams, journeys and other guff. Nevermind. It\u2019s worth it, overall. The show \u2013 executive produced by Reese Witherspoon and country star Kacey Musgraves \u2013 is designed to find country singers who do not fit the traditional Nashville mould. Allen and Guyton, who are both Black, each auditioned for American Idol early in their careers but were cut before the voting rounds and have had to negotiate the intangible barriers that stood between them and mainstream success. Peck, a gay South African musician, has had his troubles within a notably conservative and white genre, too. Each of the original dozen contestants first prepares a cover of a song that \u201cmeans something\u201d to them, under the expert guidance of wunderkind producer Adam Blackstone (musical director to just about every A-list star you can think of) before performing it at The 5 Spot, one of Nashville\u2019s oldest and most steeped-in-history venues, for the judging trio. One weakness common to all reality shows that not even this high-class effort overcomes is that we don\u2019t get to see nearly enough of their expert guidance. Why not? What could be more fascinating than watching a master of his craft work with a newcomer and teach them how to be \u2026 better? We get tiny moments, such as when Blackstone steps forward to advise Justin, a charismatic South African singer and guitarist, to \u201ctake it half a step up from A minor\u201d, and they look at each other and grin in wordless recognition of the wisdom of what he has just said. How can you not want to see more and dig down into that? After the showcases (when one contestant, usually, is sent home), the remainder take part in further workshops and elimination rounds. Allen leads a collaboration session where they all have to work with each other, to teach them that no musician is an island. Guyton hosts a performance workshop with creative director Jemel McWilliams and Peck runs a visual storytelling class in which a professional production designer helps them create their own sets to reflect their particular artistry and \u2013 yes, they\u2019ve softened me up so much I\u2019m going to say it \u2013 vision.

At the end of January, environment groups were delighted when Coffey revealed the government\u2019s Environmental Improvement Plan would include aims to plant 30,000 miles of new hedgerows a year by 2037 and 45,000 a year by 2050. Unlike many of the other pledges, this significantly outstripped recommendations by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) and other experts. However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has admitted that this was in fact a typo, and that the targets are for 30,000 miles altogether by 2037, and 45,000 altogether by 2050. This is significantly less than the first draft of the plan promised and about half of what the CCC recommends, which is 40% more hedgerows by 2050. Expanding hedgerows has been seen as a relatively easy win for tackling the climate and biodiversity crisis, as they quite easily fit into the farmed environment while having many benefits for carbon storage and wildlife. Half of England\u2019s hedgerows are estimated to have been ripped up since the second world war for farming purposes, and campaigners have been asking for them to be put back into the landscape. The Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: \u201cDefra should invest in a proof reader. Their accidental target was significantly better than the revised one. \u201cOnce again, the government has failed to create a meaningful plan to recover our natural environment. Their targets lack ambition and without the proper systems in place are likely to be missed entirely.\u201d Environment groups called for more ambitious targets. Tom Fyans, the interim CEO of the countryside charity CPRE, said: \u201cWe need to see at least double the level of ambition. The Climate Change Committee\u2019s recommendation was for 40% more hedgerows by 2050. We estimate that means around 100,000 miles by 2050 instead of the 45,000 miles ministers have included in the Environmental Improvement Plan \u2013 so less than half of what\u2019s needed. \u201cBut putting the target to one side, it\u2019s also important that the government turns its mind to delivery. This target isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on without more funding and support for farmers.\u201d Barnaby Coupe, the land use policy manager for The Wildlife Trusts, added: \u201cWe desperately need to replant lost hedgerows, as well as improving the quality of those that exist today. Government funding and ambition should reflect the importance of hedgerows in creating wildlife corridors \u2013 and planning and planting of this vital habitat should be a key priority.\u201d A Defra spokesperson admitted the error and said: \u201cHedgerows are important ecological building blocks across our landscapes. Our new farming schemes will continue to invest in incentives for maintenance and planting of hedgerows across the country. \u201cWe set out our ambition in the Environment Improvement Plan that through the support of government schemes 65 to 80% of landowners and farmers will adopt nature friendly farming practices on at least 10 to 15% of their land by 2030.

The Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services (ADCS) in England said the proposed legislation undermined existing laws that protect children, and contradicted the government\u2019s own vision for children in care, \u201cStable Homes, Built on Love\u201d, outlined last month. \u201cIf implemented, the bill will irreversibly distort the care system. The care system is not, nor should it be, a holding mechanism for the immigration system,\u201d said Steve Crocker, the ADCS president. He added: \u201cWhen a child first comes into our care, our primary focus is to find them a permanent, stable home as set out in statute. We cannot carry out this essential work if they are to be removed as soon as they turn 18 years old despite having care leaving rights and entitlements up to 25 years. \u201cThe UN convention on the rights of the child states that in all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. Sadly, this bill is a clear step away from over 30 years of custom and practice in this country.\u201d He added: \u201cAll children in this country, irrespective of where they were born, have the right to a safe and nurturing environment.\u201d The bill proposes to detain and deport asylum seekers who arrive in the UK by irregular means in small boats or in the back of lorries. Unaccompanied children will be deported when they turn 18. The Refugee Council estimates 40,000 children will be affected in the first three years if the bill becomes law. The ADCS said the statement reflected the serious concerns of local authority children\u2019s services heads about the \u201cdamaging effect\u201d the bill would have on children who had arrived in the UK having fled desperate situations. By law councils have a duty to safeguard all children in their care and ensure their needs are met. Under the Children Act 1989, for example, they are required to secure permanence for children in care. This would be impossible if, as the bill proposes, children covered by the act are deported on their 18th birthday. This cohort of migrant children would in effect become part of a two-tier care system in which they had fewer care rights than their contemporaries. It was likely to create \u201can incentive for children to run away before they turn 18 into the arms of exploiters and traffickers to avoid being returned to their home country\u201d, Crocker said. He added the lack of permanency would create \u201cunintended safeguarding risks\u201d for unaccompanied minors in local authority care, and children who are detained with their family in Home Office accommodation, for whom it was not clear where safeguarding responsibilities lay. Crocker said the bill ran counter to the government\u2019s own vision for children in care, set out with great fanfare in February in its response to the independent review of children\u2019s care. The children\u2019s care minister, Claire Coutinho, said at the time youngsters in care \u201cdeserve the same love and stability as everyone else\u201d and that \u201cmore needed to be done to protect our most vulnerable children\u201d. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the particular vulnerability of children who are often forced into making life-threatening journeys to the UK which are being facilitated by criminal gangs who have little regard for their safety. \u201cUnaccompanied children who arrive in the UK illegally will be provided with the necessary accommodation and support but they will not be able to settle in the UK once they turn 18. \u201cTaking these measures will send a clear message that children cannot be exploited and forced into crossing the Channel in small boats for the purpose of starting a new life in the UK. The only way to come to the UK for protection will be through safe and legal routes.

(Just don\u2019t ask him about his shirtless appearance in Madonna\u2019s 1992 coffee-table tome, Sex.) Now 50, he\u2019s back with a second book, Juno Loves Legs, a piercing platonic love story whose misfit protagonists careen into young adulthood in 1980s Dublin, where he himself grew up. How did the new novel start for you? With Juno\u2019s voice and this line: \u201cDear Legs, it\u2019s not gone my way.\u201d She\u2019s a bit of a bully \u2013 she elbowed and kneed her way in, screaming to be heard. I was writing a totally different book set in New York, but once I had her voice it just flatlined on the page. Did you know any Junos and Legs growing up? I knew tons. What\u2019s curious is these are outcasts among the outcasts, right? They both feel incredibly helpless, but friendship and kindness emancipate them. Juno performs this little act of courage in the playground and Legs takes her hand, and change starts to happen. Was your education at the hands of nuns and priests as harsh as theirs? It was pretty savage actually. I was careful not to overplay those cards because it becomes caricature, but in some ways I think I was kind to the establishment. When children are treated in that way, where does that trauma go? Your first novel was also set in 1980s Dublin. Are you nostalgic for that era? I wasn\u2019t writing out of nostalgia \u2013 it\u2019s something between confusion and horror, rage and love. That was a specific moment in Ireland with the receding Catholic stronghold. There was a sense of hope, this shiny new modernity\u2026 It was quickly snatched up by globalisation and now we\u2019re living in the wake of that. We\u2019re still letting our young people down. There\u2019s a trove of homeless people outside this very nice hotel. When did you leave Dublin? I left in 1988. I was 16 and I\u2019d been out of school for a while, selling wallpaper. I had a phone number of somebody in New York that I\u2019d spoken to once who ran a bicycle messenger company in the East Village, and they said come on over. What was the East Village like back then? It was wild. A lot was going on \u2013 the crack epidemic, the Aids epidemic. But there was also this cultural explosion and it introduced me to different ways of being in the world. For a while you managed Sin-\u00e9, the venue where Jeff Buckley once performed. Did any writers step on to the stage? Allen Ginsberg performed several times. He was quiet and warm, quick to smile. I remember going to see Leonard Cohen playing in the Beacon theatre. The late Hal Willner had got tickets and came with Ginsberg. During the concert, a fan threw a book on stage for Cohen and screamed: \u201cLook at the book, Leonard, look at the book!\u201d Cohen paused, and the room went silent. \u201cI see the book,\u201d says Cohen, \u201cThe book sees me\u2026 The communion is perfect.\u201d You live in Glasgow now? After Montpelier Parade, I thought: writing novels is all I want to be doing. How do I structure my life in a way that I can do this? Glasgow is probably one of the few cities that\u2019s affordable in that way. Why do you think it took you so long to become a novelist? I wrote my first when I was 21. It was terrible. When I fell into acting, I thought that was what I was supposed to be doing. It didn\u2019t suit me at all \u2013 I\u2019m far too shy. Also, my brain is hardwired as a writer, so I was always rewriting lines, but I was very quick to discard my own instinct because of my background. I looked at the statistics recently of working-class people in the arts \u2013 it\u2019s appalling and getting worse. Both your books focus on working-class characters. When we think about prose, working-class people are used for comic effect, or as a trope. I really wanted to not do that. If you take the delicate interactions that people have in their lives, you have a chance of revealing people as people, outside of their class. You get a more tactile, almost sensuous sense of a world that\u2019s usually left out. Why did writing about a platonic love affair appeal? Sexual relationships, wonderful though they are, we understand, but when you take that out of play you get to ask more interesting questions. How do people come together if not physically, how do they stay close, how do they love? Vintage clothes shops and sewing feature plenty as well. I love vintage shops. You walk in and get that smell \u2013 it\u2019s the smell of stories, because every garment has been worn for a multitude of occasions. And sewing is very like writing. I took a course in Glasgow and made a dress. It\u2019s a dog\u2019s dinner but I\u2019m so proud of it. What kind of a reader were you as a child? I was dyslexic and didn\u2019t read as a child. I came to it late. I\u2019m very aware that I have blind spots but you learn to self-educate, you learn what turns you on. It\u2019s a good way to spend time. What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve read lately? The Copenhagen Trilogy by Tove Ditlevsen is incredible. It\u2019s exactly why you\u2019d want to read.

The statistics are there to convince us that many autocracies spend much more sensibly than the world\u2019s richest democracies do. A few examples: China has increased spending on education as a percentage of its gross domestic product by 75% since 1975. In 2018, 15-year-old Chinese students had the highest average scores in the world on tests for math, science and reading, followed by Singapore, Macao and Hong Kong \u2013 \u201cnone of which is a democracy\u201d. Citizens of Singapore have an average life expectancy of around 84 and an infant mortality rate of two per 1,000 \u2013 \u201cbetter than almost every democracy\u201d. Singapore achieves that good health by spending just 4% of its GDP on healthcare \u2013 versus 17% of GDP spent in the US, which gets much less impressive results. Dunst\u2019s commonsense observations include ideas like these: weak safety nets damage citizens\u2019 confidence in their governments (and therefore should be strengthened); bad healthcare systems cost more money in the long run than good ones; and investments in infrastructure repay themselves many times over. Dunst is deputy director of research and analytics at The Asia Group and an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Looking at his own country, he is heartened that Joe Biden managed to push through a $1tn infrastructure bill, but then points out that\u2019s only 1.25% of GDP, compared with the 8.5% of GDP China spent on infrastructure every year from 1992 to 2011. \u201cChina today spends more on infrastructure than the United States and Europe do combined,\u201d Dunst writes. By spending more on things that actually matter, countries that oppress their citizens in other ways can engender remarkable levels of confidence in government. \u201cIn 2019,\u201d Dunst writes, \u201cnearly 90% of Chinese reported trust in their government \u2026 as did almost 70% of Singaporeans.\u201d Practically the only good news for democracies in this story is the fact that almost every major economy faces similar declining birth rates. Most dramatically, China has gone from 2.25 children per woman in 1990 to just 1.3 today. No major economy is producing enough children to maintain its current population. At the same time, since 2017, China\u2019s net migration rate \u2013 the number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants \u2013 \u201chas worsened every year\u201d. China lost about 335,000 people in 2022 alone. Democracies like the US, Germany and the UK all posted positive net migration rates of at least 2.7%. These numbers support one of Dunst\u2019s more optimistic notions. While \u201cChina and others may promise economic stability\u201d, democracies remain attractive because they offer \u201cmore freedom, equality and opportunities to pursue happiness\u201d. Dunst argues that one of the biggest challenges for democracies is to convince their populations of the benefits of immigration, instead of listening to politicians like Donald Trump in the US and Marine Le Pen in France, who have been so successful in reviving ancient xenophobia. Dunst also thinks education systems in places like the US and Britain need to become much more democratic. At Harvard, the acceptance rate for the children of alumni is 30%, versus 6% for the general population. In 2021, \u201cnearly a third of legacy freshmen hailed from households making more than half a million dollars\u201d. When non-connected parents \u201csee the underperforming children of top financiers and politicians vaunted into top schools and jobs because of connections, these parents will rebel against the system that allowed this to happen \u2026 They will vote for the would-be dictator.\u201d Dunst thinks we must offer more scholarships \u201cfor people studying science and technology \u2026 more funding for vocational schools\u201d and \u201cconstant skill training\u201d for the workforce. He wisely suggests that a \u201ckey reform would be to make non-regular [American] workers eligible for high-quality health insurance that travels with them from job to job\u201d. But he is also bizarrely opposed to universal healthcare \u2013 the kind that is the norm all over Europe. Suddenly, he sounds like a flack for a greedy pharmaceutical company, writing that such a system \u201ccould undermine the competitive attitude that makes the United States one of the world\u2019s leaders in medical innovation\u201d. America\u2019s continuing failure to provide decent health insurance to its most needy citizens is hardly a spur to innovation. And the fact we are the only major democracy with a healthcare system dominated by the profit motive isn\u2019t mentioned here at all. Dunst is almost entirely silent about the explosion of fake facts on the internet, which makes it so much more difficult to sell the commonsense ideas he pushes for. Another problem is his failure to acknowledge that America now has only one major political party that is genuinely interested in solving any of these fundamental problems, while the other prefers to cater to its base with attacks on wokeness or any prosecutor who thinks it makes sense to prosecute a former president for any of his dozens of alleged crimes. This is the fundamental problem facing American democracy now. As long as the Republicans control the House of Representatives or any other part of the government, the chances of enacting any of the proposals Dunst thinks necessary to help defeat the dictators \u2013 serious educational reform, immigration reform and additional infrastructure projects \u2013 are exactly zero.

While 2016\u2019s debut, Free 6lack, and 2018\u2019s East Atlanta Love Letter both traded on the downtempo, bass-heavy R&amp;B balladry that made a name for Valentine\u2019s contemporaries such as the Weeknd, his third record explores more uptempo, pop-leaning territory. Across the mammoth 19 tracks of Since I Have a Lover, Valentine experiments with glittering, guitar-strumming melodies and energetic trap drums to enticing effect. Inwood Hill Park and the title number brighten up his usually murky musical palette with their acoustic backing, giving his gravelly voice space to breathe, rather than mumble. Other songs, such as Temporary, with its fractal breakbeats, and Talkback\u2019s electric guitar hook, further broaden Valentine\u2019s scope from nocturnal bedroom beats to the dancefloor. Yet, with such a long tracklist, Since I Have a Lover is stifled by the weight of its slow and atmospheric fillers.

During the Easter holidays, she spotted a picture of some hot cross buns that another member, Nigel, had posted on the group. \u201cI was rude and told him they looked as if they belonged in a rockery. We started having a bit of banter,\u201d she says. Some of the other fans didn\u2019t like the distraction, so the pair joined a splinter group of 100 people, where they could talk about anything they liked. Nigel, a widower, told the group he was living in Winchester and working in graphic design. \u201cMary sent me a message because she was looking for a graphic designer to work on a project with her,\u201d he says. They agreed to get together for coffee to discuss it. \u201cWe met at a Costa at the edge of the M3 and ended up talking for hours,\u201d says Mary. Nigel was in awe of her. \u201cShe was so eloquent and knew her subject really well. I found her so interesting.\u201d Mary also enjoyed the fact they could laugh together. \u201cWe were pulling each other\u2019s legs. He turned up in this revolting Hawaiian shirt and we had a joke about that,\u201d she says. After he completed her graphic design project, she asked if he\u2019d consider doing the photography and design for a book she was working on. \u201cWe spent the next few months touring around the UK, doing interviews with people whose properties had been flooded,\u201d she says. \u201cThe book was designed to help people better protect their properties for the future.\u201d As they got to know each other, their friendship grew and, by the end of the year, it became clear that romance was blossoming. \u201cWe started getting closer and there was a glint in our eyes. Soon we were holding hands and going for walks together. We suddenly realised it was love,\u201d says Mary. When the pandemic hit in March, Mary went to stay with Nigel. \u201cIt was the time of my life,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cWe went for long walks and did nothing but laugh.\u201d In early 2021, they bought a house in Ledbury, not far from where Mary\u2019s five children live. \u201cNigel has two children as well, but we decided to move near my family as one of my children is severely disabled and I have young grandchildren,\u201d she says. In the summer of that year, they faced their first major challenge together when Nigel\u2019s youngest son, Mike, 26, suffered a stroke. On the same day, Mary\u2019s newborn grandson, Ethan, was scheduled for lifesaving heart surgery. \u201cIt was such a stressful time and initially we had to be in different places,\u201d says Mary. Several days later, Mike was diagnosed with a genetic heart condition and received a heart transplant. \u201cWe realised his mother must have had the same condition and that\u2019s why she died so young,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cThankfully, I had Mary by my side and we supported each other through.\u201d Nigel asked Mike if he should marry Mary. \u201cI asked him to be best man at the wedding so he would have something to look forward to and work towards.\u201d He proposed in September 2021 and, by November, both Mike and baby Ethan were well enough to attend a small, socially distanced wedding. The couple married in a manor house and invited their friends from the Archers Facebook group to watch online. \u201cWe even danced out to the Archers\u2019 theme song and Mike did an amazing speech,\u201d says Mary. As well as helping each other through family trauma, Mary says Nigel supports her in looking after her youngest son. \u201cWhen you have a child who is profoundly disabled, it can be very emotional. You can get calls at any time to say your child is being blue-lighted to a hospital or having a behavioural crisis,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can break a person, but he\u2019s always there to put his arms around me and pour me a glass of red wine.\u201d Like Mary, Nigel appreciates the relationship they\u2019ve developed. \u201cShe is so good at her job and very confident.

The noise-cancelling earbuds cost \u00a3129 ($149), undercutting rivals from OnePlus, Google, Samsung and Apple, while offering similar features and sound quality. They replace the outgoing Ear 1 from 2021, joining the novel \u00a399 Ear Stick earbuds. The buds have a more interesting look than most competitors, but a similar form with traditional silicone ear tips and a stalk hanging down. They fit well in my ears, staying secure and comfortable for a couple of hours at a time. Squeeze the stalk for onboard playback controls: once for pause/play, twice and thrice for track skip. Squeeze and hold to adjust noise cancelling, and double-squeeze and hold for volume. They work well, but adjusting the volume is a bit cumbersome compared with the swipe gestures you get on some rivals. The semi-transparent charging case looks cool and feels nice, but is a little bigger than the best in the market. The earbuds last four hours with noise cancelling active, and fully charge about 4.5 times via the case. The earbuds support Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, so they can connect to two devices at once, such as a phone and laptop, to automatically switch between them \u2013 a feature that is still rare in the market. Specifications Water resistance: IP54 (splash resistant) Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, SBC, AAC, LDHC5 Battery life: 4 hours with noise cancelling (22.5 hours with case) Earbud dimensions: 29.4 x 21.5 x 23.5mm Earbud weight: 4.5g each Driver size: 11.6mm Charging case dimensions: 55.5 x 55.5 x 22mm Charging case weight: 51.9g Case charging: USB-C, Qi wireless charging Sustainability Nothing estimates that the batteries in the earbuds and case last for at least 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity. However, they are not replaceable, ultimately making the earbuds disposable. Out-of-warranty replacement earbuds or cases are available individually for \u00a350. The earbuds contain recycled tin, but Nothing does not offer trade-in schemes in the UK, nor does it use or publish environmental impact assessments, though it does estimate the earbuds\u2019 carbon footprint at 3.1kg. Sound and noise cancelling The Ear 2 have a great, everyday listening sound that beats many at this price. They are well-rounded and can hit pretty low notes when pushed, with good separation of tones handling complex tracks well. They do a great job with many music genres, but can sometimes sound a little flat. They are an all-round improvement on their predecessors but still will not trouble the best in the business. The earbuds support hi-res audio with certain Android phones, but the difference between it at standard quality using an iPhone was marginal. The Ear 2 have active noise cancelling that, when set to maximum, did a good job of quietening the drones of engines and taking the edge off the commute, but they let through higher-pitched tones such as voices or taps on keyboards in the office. Their awareness mode is one of the better ones, sounding fairly natural for holding conversations or listening for traffic. Call quality was excellent in quiet spaces but sounded a little artificial in noisy environments, letting through only a few sudden loud noises such as car horn beeps. Price The Nothing Ear 2 cost \u00a3129 ($149). For comparison, the Nothing Ear Stick cost \u00a399, the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 cost \u00a3179, Google Pixel Buds Pro cost \u00a3179, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 cost \u00a3279.95, and the Apple AirPods Pro 2 cost \u00a3249. Verdict The Ear 2 are a set of fairly refined Bluetooth earbuds with great everyday listening sound and a more interesting look than most rivals, particularly for their competitive price. The noise cancelling reduces the rumbles of the daily commute well enough, but struggles to compete with the best for dampening distractions such as speech. They fit well and their squeeze controls are decent, as is their voice quality for calls. Being able to connect to two devices at the same time and having a cross-platform app for both Android and iPhone is very handy. The earbuds also come up a little short on battery life: just four hours before needing a charge in the case. The biggest issue is that the battery still cannot be replaced in the earbuds or case, ultimately making them disposable and losing a star. Pros: look great, good sound, good value, reasonable noise cancelling, comfortable fit, great call quality, decent controls, Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, cross-platform app. Cons: disposable, battery life a little shorter and the case a little bigger than the best, noise cancelling struggles with higher tones, no head-tracking spatial audio support.", "date": "2023-03-27", "section": "Technology", "author": "Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor", "id": 58}, {"title": "Please Baby Please review \u2013 Andrea Riseborough leads retro reverie of vamp and camp", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/27/please-baby-please-review-andrea-riseborough-leads-retro-reverie-of-vamp-and-camp", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.112, "neu": 0.679, "pos": 0.209, "compound": 0.9483}, "body": "A rocky-horror sexual awakening is promised in Amanda Kramer\u2019s initially interesting but ultimately laborious queer reverie of 50s and 60s style, like a theatrical daydream as experienced by Anybodys, from West Side Story. The long dissolve fades and blue-lit nightclub scenes are amusingly Lynchian, as is the very stylish and all-too-brief cameo from Demi Moore as a mysterious and worldly neighbour called Maureen. But the film feels over-determined and self-satisfied. Andrea Riseborough and Harry Melling play Suze and Arthur, a couple with liberal, bohemian tastes who live in a rough part of town and like going to beatnik poetry clubs. But passionate, slinky Suze is unsatisfied with her milksop husband Arthur; he rejects caveman masculinity and quotes Hamlet: \u201cMan delights not me, no nor woman neither \u2026\u201d (Their apartment has the Shakespearean number 2B.) Then one evening they chance across a gang of murderous delinquents, led by Brandoesque tough guy Teddy (Karl Glusman) and something in his thrillingly criminal muscularity excites Suze and Arthur. And so the curtain rises on a fantasy floorshow of vamp and camp, showcasing flourishes of sexuality and brutal violence. But where are we heading with it all and what is it telling us that we didn\u2019t know before? Suze and Arthur are already established as \u2013 respectively \u2013 sexily dominant and wimpily passive and so the big change doesn\u2019t radically subvert what we\u2019ve already been given, and Riseborough\u2019s stagey performance has been over-directed. But there is an amusing scene in which Suze sneaks into a gay soft-porn cinema (about to be raided) showing a surreal black-and-white film of two beefcake guys wrestling in a swimming pool underwater.
