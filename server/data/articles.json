He served the council for 21 years, first as Labour and later a Green party representative, as well as being a Nailsworth town councillor for 14 years, including three as mayor. Norman was first elected as a Labour councillor in 1983, for the village of Leonard Stanley and then Nailsworth. He became deputy leader of the Labour group, chief whip and chair of the housing committee. Following the Iraq war, he resigned from the Labour party and was re-elected to Stroud district council as a Green councillor in 2016. Besides being chair and vice-chair, he served on a wide range of committees. A Stroud Green party spokesperson described him as \u201cirreplaceable\u201d. Born in Bethnal Green, east London, to Sylvia (nee Sidloff) and Sidney Kay, a radical Jewish family, Norman went to Hackney Downs grammar school. He became politically active as a teenager, serving as secretary of Hackney Independent Labour party. After a spell of taxi driving in London, he studied sociology and political science under Zygmunt Bauman at Leeds University and was elected to the student union executive committee. After graduation, he became a social worker in Doncaster in 1973, then Bristol in 1976, and, finally, Gloucestershire, from the early 1980s to 2006. With his wife, Kate (nee Berry), whom he met at university and married in 1971, and some friends he established a socialist/feminist bookshop in Bristol called Full Marks. Master\u2019s degrees in social administration under Peter Townsend (Bristol University, 80s) and public administration (Birmingham University, 90s), and a degree in chemistry (Open University, 2000s) followed. By the 90s, Norman was managing his own adult and mental health social work team. He was accredited as a specialist in mental health early in his time at Bristol. A kind, gentle and principled man, Norman was widely respected across his community. He could \u201cdisagree agreeably\u201d, and worked constructively with a wide range of groups, of different political views and none. A committed member of the council\u2019s equality, diversity and inclusion working group, he was its chair in 2021. He was actively involved in Stroud\u2019s Gay Pride and Holocaust Memorial days and supported anti-slavery initiatives, including the removal of the Blackboy clock in Stroud. He also supported calls for Palestinian rights. Norman collected for the poppy appeal every year and served on the Cotswolds area of outstanding natural beauty committee. He was active in promoting the Stroud show and liked to exhibit his own rare breed Cotswold sheep locally. Norman and Kate also had a goat, horses and pigs. He was still looking after his livestock up to last year. A keen racing supporter, he was a member of Cheltenham racecourse. I met Norman at a constituency Labour party meeting in Stroud, where Kate and I shared the role of constituency secretary. He and I were friends for 40 years. Norman is survived by Kate, and his sister, Frances.", "date": "2024-01-14", "section": "Society", "author": "Joy Greenwood", "id": 0, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/932ea6e3cb1eb20b45aa0b30beffc6f32226e3f6/0_89_1262_757/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Kim\u2019s Convenience review \u2013 popcorn retail therapy spun from sitcom", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/14/kims-convenience-review-park-theatre-london-ins-choi", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.057, "neu": 0.729, "pos": 0.213, "compound": 0.9918}, "body": "Before Kim\u2019s Convenience became a hit Netflix series, it was a play on the Toronto fringe. Now, Ins Choi\u2019s comedy drama turned sitcom, about the travails of a Korean Canadian family running a convenience store, returns to theatrical form but feels like a melange of two media. The cast is not that of the TV show, and Choi himself plays outspoken father, Appa, but the production has the uncanny, slightly confusing, look and feel of a live TV studio recording. It is a smooth machine of a show nonetheless: its comedy works, its acting superb, its story warm but not too mawkish and its characters lovable even when they border on the prejudiced, like Appa. Masterfully directed by Esther Jun, this is popcorn theatre: we could go on watching and watching. The story crunches strands from across the five series into 80 minutes. Beneath the comedy are themes of immigration, parental sacrifice and the gulf between Appa and his children. There is his daughter, Janet (Jennifer Kim), whom he wants to divert from photography into running the shop, and his estranged son, Jung (Brian Law), who left home years ago. Janet feels like the focus here, her romance with police officer Alex (Miles Mitchell) lifted from the first series, and Kim plays her with feisty energy. Choi is fantastic as Appa but wife Umma (Namju Go) is shadowy, not nearly as characterful as on screen. Mona Camille\u2019s set is such an exact replica of a local supermarket, with its lotto card advert, drinks fridge and linoleum-covered aisles, it is its own wonder. The delight is in the detail, right down to the sound of the electric bell as customers enter an invisible door. For fans of the TV show, there is deja vu in some scenes which are also exact replicas, such as the skit about the Honda parked outside which reveals Appa\u2019s grudge against the Japanese (\u201cIn 1904 Japan attacked Korea\u201d), and the \u201csteal or no steal\u201d scene, involving a Black man whom Appa identifies as a thief, and is one example of the show\u2019s edgy race satire. These scenes carry the sense of a show delivering its \u201cbest bits\u201d rather than offering something entirely original. Yet it works, and is still funny the second time around \u2013 as a repeat episode of Friends might be. Theatre has increasingly started to adapt television shows or feel episodic in their script.

Warming up a largely sedate audience in Cadogan Hall for Australian guitar virtuoso Tommy Emmanuel, by the time she\u2019d finished with them, they were awakened rangers ready to grab the bull by the horns. Renowned for her acrobatic skill with the guitar, effortlessly moving from crosspicking to flatpicking and clawhammer strums (\u201cI know we\u2019re all guitar nerds here\u201d), she plays it with the ease of meeting an old friend. Though her fables of life on the open road, matters of the heart and cannabis farmers in the Blue Ridge Mountains are usually embroidered by her band Golden Highway, tonight, she plays solo \u2013 but this is far from a stripped-back performance. She mines the instrument for the bass and rhythm in remarkable self-sufficiency, galloping through the valleys of El Dorado and San Joaquin drawn from her latest album City of Gold. Tuttle may know how to sing the high lonesome, but she performs her songs grinning ear to ear as if letting you in on a secret, often throwing in a wink for good measure. Her rendition of the sprightly sing-along Side Saddle, an anthem of spirited independence defying those who say \u201ca girl can\u2019t ride\u201d, has the fun and intimacy of a campfire jam. Calling on bluegrass camaraderie, her audience, at first placid, were now all too willing to take up her invitation to whistle along.

Sixty dancers, musicians and singers, four new music and dance works and a stunning setting, formerly part of the Royal Arsenal, with a catwalk-like stage bisecting the room. It\u2019s loaded with ambition and class, not just the ingredients but the way the whole evening is designed. We start with two musical works: the hushed echoes of Andrea Balency-B\u00e9arn\u2019s Appels, then baritone Ross Ramgobin singing Yshani Perinpanayagam\u2019s setting of John Cage\u2019s love letters to Merce Cunningham. \u201cMy dearest Merce, I\u2019m writing a new piece ... and the only one I can imagine listening to it is you.\u201d The dancers are woven into the music before setting out on their own adventure, each piece follows the next without pause (or applause) building an absorbing atmosphere absolutely fitting the mood of the central feature, Les Noces. The original Les Noces \u2013 music by Stravinsky, dance by Bronislava Nijinska \u2013 premiered a century ago, the story of a Russian peasant wedding, it\u2019s a chilling picture of a forced marriage and a powerful piece of protofeminism. This new work, choreographed collectively by the performers, leans on ideas of community and its dutiful or surprising bonds, the dancers entangled or drawn together in unison, picking out rhythms from the musical layers, while individuals briefly break free from the group. The dancers of New Movement Collective are mostly veterans of Rambert, with decades of embodied knowledge between them and their movement carries weight and purpose and nothing superfluous, unfussy lines like the well-ironed seams of their nicely tailored costumes. In fleeting imagery, their bolero jackets become props, tied into a rope or a bride\u2019s veil and train. But against the power of the original Les Noces, the strength of the theme and innovation of the language feels a little pale. Stravinsky\u2019s score, played in the original arrangement for four pianos and percussion, with the chorus of Opera Holland Park, is adrenalised and ominous. Excellent soprano soloist April Koyejo-Audiger gets it: the urgency, her ringing notes that impel you, \u201cListen!\u201d There\u2019s a lot to love in this richly interesting evening. \u2022 At Woolwich Works, 14 January", "date": "2024-01-14", "section": "Stage", "author": "Lyndsey Winship", "id": 3, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a6b1bb78ca910d97a58ecb806f51b7f1d6321e17/0_224_4545_2727/500.jpg"}, {"title": "The January transfer window is open\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/14/eva-wiseman-the-january-transfer-window-is-for-life-not-just-football", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.136, "neu": 0.631, "pos": 0.233, "compound": 0.9949}, "body": "Ah January. Too many vowels, too little time, it rises baldly on the horizon, an awkward and needy wasteland. And we dash around upon it as if walking the dogs of our regrets, searching for our new selves in its bleak whiteness and swinging our dainty plastic bags of shit. We are looking for meaning or, failing that, some kind of structure within which we can enable change. A game, a routine, to help each other move forward with purpose. I have a suggestion. Forget new year resolutions, forget dry January (which mad cow came up with this, by the way, this idea that January, a month of relentless rain, anxiety and sorrow, would be a good time to face reality head on, without even a colourful cocktail to take the edge off? Without even a little paper umbrella to protect us?). Instead, embrace the January transfer window. As in football, so in life \u2013 you have one month in which to barter and negotiate to create a new identity; a better, sleeker, more winning you. The deadline for decisions is dead strict and counted down live on clocks across the internet. There is something inspiring about the urgency, the pressure. It becomes its own sport. But I am less interested in the million pound fates of Jadon Sancho or Aaron Ramsdale than I am in the urgent reshaping of mine and my friends\u2019 lives. These are the teams I support. These are the athletes who I will trek out in the rain for and stand shivering and singing for even as they lose. Their pain and their happiness and their decisions about paint colours for the bedroom, this is my sport, this is why I scroll, refresh, refresh. After a season of shared colds and bickering in Tescos along the south coast, many are eyeing relationship transfers, kissing a stranger in the smoking area, setting into motion the dramatic denouement of their current marriage. January is an excellent time to make your substitutions. Is it time? Look around. If you\u2019re ready to find a new lover, simply everybody else will look hot. That hiker in the head-to-toe waterproofs muttering there\u2019s no such thing as bad weather \u2013 yes. The suspicious checkout assistant who keeps their eyebrow fully raised when you\u2019re trying to return an unwanted gift from your cousin \u2013 yes. The delivery driver who asks if they can use your loo and fills the house with the smell of smoked meat \u2013 yes. Perhaps, instead of simply ushering in a replacement partner, you want to restructure the relationship itself and investigate polyamory, or consensual non-monogamy, or create a throuple or some other form of many syllabled entanglement. While news of such flexible experiments delights me, when I think about participating in such a relationship myself I am reminded of someone recently describing the special pain of cooking with garlic and how each clove has its own paperwork. But this admin is what the transfer window is perfect for: negotiate your terms, organise a medical and usher in a new signing, or a whole new team. I had a haircut recently, which, returning home, was a shock for a number of reasons, the most lasting being the realisation that I do not present as the person I believe I am. When I asked for a short, messy bob, I assumed the hairdresser would look at me and understand what I meant. That she would see, if not quite a mischievous young punk, then at least someone with memories of nighttimes past, rather than, as became clear when I looked in the mirror at the end after she\u2019d sculpted what she assumed was an appropriate cut, a middle-aged mum who had to rush back to get tea on. It has spurred me to pay more attention to my appearance and use this transfer window to switch out my current look, a sort of \u201cslouching towards Brent Cross\u201d and replace it with something altogether more chic and dynamic. Rather than dieting or detoxing or any of that absolute silliness, what I am planning to do is alter the look in my eyes. Out with jolly exhaustion and in with a steely gaze, alert, reckless, a certain wild suspense. I am spending January learning how to style this new haircut less cosily, I am throwing out another bag of jumpers and I am adopting a new walk, the walk of somebody taller who has made better decisions. I am using eye cream at night and tanning drops in the day. In February, I intend to return to the hairdresser and test my new squad, by which, of course, I mean, see if this fresh combination of dignity and sass will lead to me emerging with the hair of a modern Debbie Harry, rather than Debbie, Harry\u2019s mum who always wears a travel bumbag containing a massive set of keys. Join me. Switch out grand ambition for focused slog, swap tired pettiness for rich passion, untested prejudices for educated compassion, buy in the bravery to be disliked, switch in pleasure: drink, smoke, sleep, sell off abstinence, bitterness, guilt. March out on to the pitch in February transformed \u2013 bigger, better, stronger, in a chic little haircut and absolutely exquisite shorts.

She was a dancer before she was a writer and you can feel the commitment to the fire of bodily motion in her masterpieces: the shimmeringly brutal excavation of girlhood and violence in Jane, the story of her aunt\u2019s killing at the hands of a rapist; the clear-headed yet ecstatic celebration of the transformations of pregnancy and top surgery, and the new kind of family she and her trans partner brought into being in The Argonauts (2015). Her dedication to the material finds the forms it needs; I don\u2019t think she sets out to bend genres. Instead, her high-stakes eviscerations of body settle into radically new forms. Is this the energy of the rebel or the valedictorian? For decades, Nelson has parted her hair, fastened her top button, won the right grades and grants while throwing herself voluptuously into the counterculture, dreaming of being an \u201celectric ribbon of horniness and divine grace\u201d like one of her inspirations, Prince. It\u2019s an American energy \u2013 expansive, new, full of power, pleasure, change and motion; a frontier energy, even when she\u2019s writing about New York. We can hear Whitman behind her, and Emerson. \u201cPower ceases in the instant of repose,\u201d Emerson pronounces in Self-Reliance; \u201cit resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of a gulf, in the darting to an aim.\u201d A decade after The Argonauts became the bible of English graduates everywhere, the essays in Like Love arrive to help us understand Nelson\u2019s place in a culture where, to her half-delight, she has become such a powerful voice. Spanning two decades, they range from appreciations of influences including Prince and Judith Butler, to wild, freefalling conversations with figures such as Bj\u00f6rk, Wayne Koestenbaum and Jacqueline Rose. There is a passionate, wondering account of her formative half-erotic friendship with the singer Lhasa de Sela. The writing isn\u2019t consistent, any more than her books are. But I like to take my thinkers and writers whole, as she does. The essays offer a kind of composite self-portrait, and illustrate how she thinks, sometimes painstakingly, sometimes with casual jubilance, about some of the central dilemmas of our time. In the face of the climate crisis, how to avoid \u201cgiving in to the narcissistic spectacle of the slo-mo Titanic going down\u201d? In the face of the crisis in feminism, how and whether to move beyond sexual difference? The written exchanges show her interlocutors thinking it through, too. \u201cYou dare to step into the future like no one else atm,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk says. It\u2019s true. This is where all that restless energy is leading. This is why she\u2019s an Emersonian, shying away from nihilism. \u201cThere are new lands, new men, new thoughts,\u201d Emerson wrote in Nature, discarding the \u201cdry bones\u201d of his ancestors; \u201cLet us demand our own works and laws and worship.\u201d In her powerful piece on the artist Carolee Schneemann, Nelson posits her as a female incarnation of Emerson\u2019s self-reliant man. But it\u2019s Nelson herself who proffers new laws and worship \u2013 whose project amounts to a practical philosophy of contemporary American culture. In The Argonauts she offers the gift of a future we can somehow share; one that acknowledges the miseries of the present, that has space for dreams, but is obstinately material and in our world. Here, in dialogue with Jacqueline Rose, she proposes that \u201cEverybody deserves the kind of non-stultifying internal breathing space of fluidity or instability that is attributed to queers, or to women, or whatever.\u201d Like Love\u2019s title comes from theatre critic Hilton Als\u2019s vision of a group on the subway not as white women or black men but as mouths that need filling \u201cwith something wet or dry, like love, or unfamiliar and savory, like love\u201d. Nelson, too, is drawn to mouths \u2013 to orifices in general \u2013 as organs of pleasure and pain, and as portals enabling a radical openness. Because Nelson likes writing about her friends, there\u2019s a kind of homogeneity to much of the book that cumulatively left me feeling a little claustrophobic, longing especially for the roominess of time travel. With the exception of 2009\u2019s Bluets, Nelson\u2019s writing is so located in the postwar world that the past can feel entirely absent. This is her affinity with Emerson and Whitman again \u2013 her song to the future \u2013 but I wonder if I\u2019m alone in wishing that, alongside those two often acknowledged ancestors, her future could have artists, activists and libertines from earlier centuries informing it, too. Which is not to say that she\u2019s wrong to write about the people in her circle. The brutality of the present moment may require us precisely to batten down the hatches and commit to extreme solidarity. At a time when institutional life is collapsing, when the pandemic privileged family over friends, when work expands in ways that leave many too exhausted to socialise, Nelson demonstrates what it means to dedicate yourself to a cohort with seriousness and strenuousness. \u201cYou, to me, quickly became an inspiration,\u201d she tells the poet Brian Blanchfield, \u201ca brother, a support in times of seriously dark waters, an editor, a lender of excellent and pivotal books, a cheerleader, a colleague, a couch sleeper (and couch mover), a fellow swimmer \u2026 a corrupting gambler, (queer) family.\u201d Like Love may be one of the most movingly specific, the most lovingly unruly celebrations of the ethics of friendship we have. \u2022 Lara Feigel is the author of Look!

It was one of many such announcements in 2024, but this case is especially egregious because Take-Two ownsRockstar Games, which publishes Grand Theft Auto, AKA the most successful game in the history of the world, and is definitely not short of profits. Last week, Bloomberg (\u00a3) reported on internal documentation showing the likely victims of these cuts: studios Intercept Games in Seattle and Roll7 in London are set to close. Both are part of Private Division, the giant publisher\u2019s indie game label. I spent some time with Intercept\u2019s Kerbal Space Program 2 last year, when they were gearing up to launch. This exceptionally nerdy game about getting tiny green astronauts into space, which hews so closely to the real life physics of space flight that it inspired a generation of engineering students, has had a troubled time. It had been through a studio closure and a change of developer already, and its early-access launch did not exactly go without a hitch (Rock Paper Shotgun called it a \u201chot mess\u201d). Kerbal Space Program 2 deserves a chance to turn things around, but it is understandable why its developer ended up on the block. Roll7, meanwhile, was only acquired by Take-Two in 2021, and has released two successful and critically acclaimed games since. OlliOlli World is a fantastic, stylish cartoon skateboarding game with oodles of personality. And the similarly slick-looking Rollerdrome (pictured below), an arena deathmatch game on rollerskates, won a Bafta last year for best British game. Roll7 has a 15-year history of interesting and \u2013 crucially! \u2013 profitable games, most based on interesting and original ideas: Not a Hero was a 2D cover shooter where you were sent out to assassinate criminals by a purple bunny; Laser League was an arena combat-sports game inspired by Tron. Every studio closure is a tragedy for the people affected, but this one feels personally gutting. I\u2019ve played Roll7\u2019s games for more than a decade, starting with the superbly intricate 2D skateboarding game OlliOlli, which obsessed me on my PlayStation Vita for most of 2014 \u2013 and they are really good. OlliOlli World (pictured above) is tremendous. I\u2019ve also met (and interviewed) several of the people at Roll7 over the years, and it was a developer with a unique creative culture. It absolutely sucks to lose a studio like this. But it\u2019s also such an insulting rug pull for a studio that, until a few years ago, was getting by as an independent outfit. When Eurogamer interviewed the studio\u2019s leadership shortly after the 2K acquisition, co-founder John Ribbins seemed palpably relieved to have been acquired by a big publisher, because he thought it came with a certain level of safety. This news is an unwelcome reminder that there is no such thing as safety in the games industry, even if your studio is successful by any measure, making acclaimed and successful award-winning games. Most of the world\u2019s big publishers now operate on an extreme \u201cgo big or go home\u201d basis that leaves no room for anything that isn\u2019t grotesquely profitable. When even a studio like Roll7 can\u2019t count on the support of a company like Take-Two, can anyone? Take-Two still hasn\u2019t officially confirmed the closure, though. \u201cOn April 16th, Take-Two announced a cost reduction program to identify efficiencies across its business and to enhance the Company\u2019s margin profile, while still investing for growth,\u201d reads its statement. \u201cAs part of these efforts, the Company is rationalising its pipeline and eliminating several projects in development and streamlining its organisational structure, which will eliminate headcount and reduce future hiring needs. The Company is not providing additional details on this program.\u201d The kind of games and studios that are being \u201crationalised\u201d out of existence here are exactly the kind that we need in 2024: smaller, creatively interesting games that offer alternatives to the increasingly homogeneous gaming behemoths that have been hoovering up money for more than 10 years. Roll7\u2019s releases are exactly the kinds of games that should form part of an artistically as well as monetarily valuable portfolio for a publisher such as Take-Two. Grand Theft Auto prints money, and the publisher\u2019s executives take home tens of millions every year. Is it actually true now that such a publisher can\u2019t support smaller games, too \u2013 even if they win awards and turn a profit? What is the point of having an \u201cindie\u201d publishing label if you\u2019re simply going to buy good studios and shut them down after barely two years? This is another cautionary tale about the vandalism that gaming\u2019s biggest corporations can enact on the studios they acquire, and I feel as incensed by it as I did by Microsoft\u2019s closure of Lionhead in 2016. As this newsletter went to press, IGN reported the equally devastating news that Microsoft is to shutter Tango Gameworks, makers of the brilliant and interesting Hi-Fi Rush and unique Japanese ghost story Ghostwire Tokyo, along with Arkane Austin \u2013 whose latest game, Redfall, was a flop, but which previously had a hand in some of the most critically acclaimed games of the last generation. Gigantic, samey games played by tens of millions of people should not be the entire future of video games. Creative developers deserve better than this, and so do we. What to play Styled like a lost PlayStation 1 classic, Crow Country is a horror adventure game in which you explore an abandoned theme park full of mutated \u2026 guests, and it is really creepy, right down to the lo-fi rattling and squelching and creaking of all the old attractions. Even without all the mutants, this theme park itself is horrible! Why would anyone have come here? I particularly admire the dedication to the mid-90s low-poly fuzzy-around-the-edges look, which recalls the best of this era of horror games without the endless loading times, annoying controls and inventory management. If you like the sound of this game\u2019s premise but are, like me, a total coward, I have good news: you can play the game in a mode with no enemies, so you can solve the puzzles and soak up the horrible ambience without the constant threat. Available on: PC, PlayStation 5 Estimated playtime: Less than five hours What to read PlayStation has had an unpleasant week. After its breakout hit Helldivers 2 (above) sold millions on PC, the company demanded that PC players sign up for a PlayStation Network account in order to continue playing. This resulted in a player revolt, the game being removed from sale in 177 countries where PSN is not operational, more than 100,000 negative Steam reviews and, eventually, an ignominious climbdown. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning what is best for PC players,\u201d read Sony\u2019s statement. That much is blindingly obvious. The bigger Florida version of the Universal Studios Nintendo theme park is shaping up pretty well. That Donkey Kong-themed Mine Cart rollercoaster looks just the right amount of terrifying. In more \u201cbig publishers are terrible at fostering creativity\u201d news, a video from DidYouKnowGaming\u2019s Liam Robertson (via Kotaku) lays out how US studio Vicarious Visions was ultimately prevented from working on a whole bunch of interesting projects, from a Donkey Kong 3D platformer to more remasters of the Tony Hawk skateboarding games, in favour of \u2026 yet more Call of Duty.

By contrast, I was amazed how Untitled Goose Game captures an esoteric British village perfectly, with no speaking characters and relatively simple shapes. Can you recommend any other games that faithfully represent regions on a small-scale?\u201d Alba: A Wildlife Adventure is one of these for me (with the important caveat that I have never been to Valencia, where it is set). It portrays a small island community and the people, birds, colours and geography of the place feel so intimate and believable. A Highland Song, meanwhile, depicts a place with which I am intimately familiar: the mountains and austere coast of Scotland. Its perfect light and rough brushstrokes communicate the unforgiving beauty of my home country so gorgeously. And there\u2019s the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, whose perfect re-creations of Japanese cities heave with life. I\u2019d love to hear from readers on this one: what games set in real places have done a great job of conjuring their spirit?

Still in my teens, I wore through the carpet doing her workout videos in front of the TV. I also spent hours ploughing up and down the pool at the local leisure centre and honing my muscles at the gym. I always regarded fitness as my superpower. Something that I worked hard at, for sure, but something that gave me kudos. Keeping fit \u2013 I mean, really fit \u2013 seemed to me an admirable and noble pursuit. I could fit into nice clothes easily. I could push my body and trust it not to fail. Whatever other qualities I didn\u2019t possess, whatever I wasn\u2019t good enough at, I could walk into a gym or toe a start line for a race and pass muster. I trained to be a personal trainer, so I could guide others to their \u201cfitness goals\u201d. But it was running that really got me, quickly becoming part of my identity. I ran my first marathon aged 22 \u2013 and went on to become a coach, write books about running and host running retreats. Running may look like freedom, but it can also be about control. Distances must be covered, paces maintained, pounds shed, personal bests (PBs) bettered. I now see that latching on to the pursuit of fitness so young was a way of imposing control on my body, of searching for approval and bringing order to my unravelling family life. It worked, too. But it also became a habit. Like a magic suit, a fit body protects you from others\u2019 scorn, as well as worries about the usual concerns of ageing, such as weight gain and failing health. But it takes time, energy and discipline to achieve and maintain such a body, requiring rules and restraint that can be life-limiting and reek of patriarchal control. I was in thrall to fitness for three decades. But, when lockdown happened, when gyms, athletics tracks, swimming pools and running clubs closed, when sporting events were cancelled, when I was limited to solitary runs, a feeling crept over me. What was it all for? One day, in that endlessly glorious spring, I was running along the riverbank. Running had begun to feel joyless and unusually laboured. That point, a few miles in, when you can step aside from the physicality of the endeavour and just let it happen was proving elusive. I was present, every jarring, heavy-footed step of the way, my cadence spelling out what for, what for, what for? I tried to push through it \u2013 until, suddenly, neither my body nor my brain could find a reason to carry on. I slowed to a walk. I stopped my watch. I sat down and had a little cry, the sweat drying on my back. Then I walked home. It wasn\u2019t a one-off. While I continued to go through the motions, my dedication to fitness felt increasingly hollow. And, frankly, shallow. As Sarah Donaghy said, when I interviewed her about Food Bank Run: \u201cRunning can be a solitary \u2013 even selfish \u2013 endeavour, with its focus on individual performance and PBs.\u201d While I struggled on throughout that summer, squeezing myself into running like a garment that no longer fitted, I began to regard it as a ball and chain, a drain on my resources. This was a big inconvenience for someone whose career was largely built around running. Eventually, I could no longer ignore the questions my body and mind were raising. My search for answers led me to reconsider not just my attitude to my body and to running, but to life itself. To finding meaning and purpose, to achievement and ageing and to that ultimate finish line, mortality. Ageing, without doubt, played its part in this shift. I turned 50 in 2019, and I was beginning to realise that the absence of new PBs wasn\u2019t some kind of temporary blip \u2013 it was terminal. Try as you might, you cannot compete with the 30-year-old you, or the 40-year-old you. If running is no longer about improvement, achievement, what can it be, I wondered. What am I getting out of it? What am I putting in? Is there something else I should be doing instead? For many, this is the point where age grading comes to the fore \u2013 many people get great pleasure from being \u201cgood for your age\u201d. A part of me has great admiration for the 80- to 90-year-olds training for Masters competitions and pursuing every possible marginal gain. But, as the planet and its human and non-human inhabitants face climate breakdown and all the injustice, inequality, exploitation and loss that comes with it, I can\u2019t help wondering if all that energy could be put to better use. I stopped running altogether for a while, and was appalled when I could no longer fit into some of my clothes. The shame of my expanding, softening body almost lured me back in, but, once again, my body rebelled, voting, quite literally, with its feet. \u201cDon\u2019t want to slip back into being governed by running,\u201d I wrote in my diary. \u201cDo you really want to be the same person you were a year ago, five years ago, instead of moving forward?\u201d Four years on, I am less fit than I was. I cannot assume the same protective benefits of fitness on my health. I can\u2019t automatically pick up size 10 garments, nor assume that I can do parkrun in under 22 minutes. Not being able to do these things any longer feels uncomfortable \u2013 as uncomfortable as having a visible tummy. But there are benefits, too. All that energy I poured into fitness for three decades is mine again. I think more, I notice more, I write more, I have wider interests. I finished a part-time MA last year, and I volunteer in conservation work. I am more aware of the world around me, good and bad. In his essay How to Live With Dying, the philosopher and lifelong avid runner John Kaag writes how a cardiac arrest, minutes after finishing a punishing treadmill run, changed his perspective on life. \u201cAt a certain point, going the extra mile does not make you a better athlete. It just makes you an idiot,\u201d he says. There\u2019s still the odd pang for my old fitness level, my former body \u2013 and even for the rigours of the pursuit itself. But, whatever I may have lost, I\u2019ve gained so much more. \u201cIn the end,\u201d writes Kaag, \u201cmost of us wish we\u2019d spent less time on the treadmill, whatever form it might take.\u201d", "date": "2024-05-08", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Sam Pyrah", "id": 9, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/df5fb44fe28b36fb6e7a26059c2df7126034ad02/0_93_3024_1815/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Dawn of the Big Yin: rediscovered film shows Billy Connolly on the road to comedy glory", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/may/08/big-yin-billy-connolly-big-banana-feet-documentary-film-comedy", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.1, "neu": 0.671, "pos": 0.229, "compound": 0.9959}, "body": "In an age where our every selfie, photogenic breakfast and \u201cthing I\u2019m ashamed to admit\u201d is preserved eternally online, it\u2019s a shock to recall that actual art was once disposable \u2013 and prone to getting lost. Big Banana Feet, a documentary chronicling the Irish leg of Billy Connolly\u2019s 1975 UK tour, was consigned more or less to oblivion when its distributor later went bust, and director Murray Grigor left his own personal copy with a friend in the US, never to be seen again. Until now: the film was rediscovered four years ago in an archive at the University of California, and is being re-released by the BFI in a lovingly restored print. It\u2019s quite the time capsule, with its endless fag-smoking and a backstage sequence \u2013 oh, the glamour! \u2013 featuring Belfast tea ladies and their slow-pouring pot of tea. It\u2019s also an absorbing portrait of Britain\u2019s most influential comic as he teeters on the brink of megastardom. Inspired, says Grigor, by DA Pennebaker\u2019s film of Bob Dylan\u2019s 1965 UK tour, Don\u2019t Look Back, it follows the Glaswegian on what was then (shortly after his famous 1975 Parkinson appearance) the biggest domestic tour ever undertaken by a solo artist, as he performs first in Dublin then in Belfast. It\u2019s gorgeous to see him here so young and full of life, palpably a people\u2019s person \u2013 chewing the fat with squaddies, the support act, those tea ladies \u2013 even as he begins to withdraw, as you\u2019d have to, from the growing celebrity clamour. The Belfast gigs are particularly noteworthy, because the city was a dangerous one to visit at the time. Members of a touring cabaret band had been killed in an attack by the UVF months previously. Major stars had cancelled the Northern Ireland leg of their tours. Connolly\u2019s insistence that these gigs go ahead was a kind of cultural lifeline for the province, beating a path where others could follow. You can watch Big Banana Feet for the socio-politics, then, and find it fascinating. But you can watch it for the comedy, too \u2013 or for the moments where they meet. At one point, a Belfast audience member hands Connolly a red rose. He accepts with gratitude \u2013 then mimes the explosion that would ensue (\u201cboooom!\u201d) if the rose somehow concealed a bomb. A risky gag \u2013 but not as risky as had he performed his anti-army song Sergeant, Where\u2019s Mine in Belfast, which, mid-gig, he opts not to do. I\u2019m not here to remind them of the Troubles, Connolly later argues, but to make them laugh. But not just make them laugh. One of the attractions of the documentary is that it finds Connolly at a pivotal moment of self-definition. We see several interviews with journalists, trying to pin down the Big Yin phenomenon as it forms. One marvels \u2013 a sign of the times, this \u2013 that \u201cyou don\u2019t even have an exciting stage name, you sound like the boy next door\u201d. Others oblige Connolly to defend the vulgarity that supposedly characterises his routine about swearing on TV (still a novel idea in 1975), or his song toying with the delights of the Four-Letter Word. It\u2019s a plus \u00e7a change moment as Connolly \u2013 like many a comic today \u2013 advises that people who might be offended should simply stay away. Then another journo pitches in: \u201cAre you a comedian or an entertainer?\u201d And Connolly doesn\u2019t have a ready answer. Both? Neither? \u201cA comic singer,\u201d he goes for, if only to get the guy off his back. I love that he doesn\u2019t know. This was a time before \u201cstandup comedy\u201d had taken its current shape, and before everything was commodified and marketed to the point of calcification. Connolly clearly didn\u2019t feel the modern pressure to refine his brand, and onstage, he did what he liked: politics and ridiculous fruit footwear, soulful ballads like Sergeant, Where\u2019s Mine and standup about farting, all in the same show. Showing us something special in genesis, back when touring comedy was barely a thing, Big Banana Feet is a great rediscovery.

My particular experience is working with the youngest children as they begin learning to read. Since 2021, schools in England have been required to follow the highly prescriptive systematic synthetic phonics (SSP) scheme. The \u201cfully decodable\u201d books approved for SSP schemes must focus on the spelling pattern to be learned, usually at the expense of a good story or any literary merit. Right from the start of school, enjoyment of books is being squeezed out. However, your contention that the curriculum model of little blocks of tightly controlled content is \u201cmore suited to science and maths\u201d must be challenged. My other role is as a maths tutor to teenagers. I find that they have been rushed to learn ever more complicated formulas and procedures without time to investigate ideas, to make links between topics or to develop thinking skills. Mathematics is a deeply creative subject. Advances are made by finding new ways of thinking rather than by applying known formulae. Just as with English, the current fact-heavy GCSE and A-level maths curriculums squeeze out the joy of learning. A general curriculum review is needed. The soul has been knocked out of the English curriculum, but mathematics has been just as badly served. Ruth Allen Nottingham \u2022 It was so cheering to read your call for the pleasure of reading to be restored to the classroom. We all get the joy of sharing a picture book with young children, looking at the pictures, laughing together, perhaps enjoying the rhyme as we talk the words off the page. But for many children, that simple joy of reading gets lost when they learn to read. They have to work hard to sound words out, and the story can become dull and restricted by what phonic sounds they are able to recognise. Language is stripped down to its component parts, reading becomes a chore, and parents and children get trapped in a reading battle. Many schools are shifting the tide on this, and classrooms and corridors are beginning to buzz with reading-friendly spaces, brilliant books are positioned to tempt and children are encouraged to chat about their reading choices. But it\u2019s an uphill battle. Let\u2019s support schools, parents and carers to get children back to a place of sharing a book because they really want to. The benefits to all are clear. Amy Lewis Head of Coram Beanstalk \u2022 I couldn\u2019t agree more with your editorial. I have taught English at secondary level for almost 50 years. For the first 25 years or so, the text was king. We read, discussed, engaged, argued, talked about life, society, morality, emotion \u2013 literally everything writers write about. Then, gradually and insidiously, the assessment objectives and mark schemes usurped the text. Thinking and responding gave way to spotting. It became less important to discuss why Hamlet asks \u201cTo be or not to be?\u201d and what that suggests about the human condition, and more important to identify the rhetorical device Shakespeare used. Teachers became obliged to value what could be measured rather than continuing to teach what is valuable, and the subject became a shadow of its former self.

A survival horror game about the dark secrets lurking within and beneath an abandoned theme park, it is also a gorgeous homage to landmark games of the past. The look of the game is breathtaking: the thick, grainy patina over the screen gives the impression of playing on a CRT monitor in somebody\u2019s dimly lit bedroom in 1997. The chunky polygonal figure of the protagonist, the mysterious Mara Forest, serves a stark contrast against the set and landscape, which give the impression of the lush pre-rendered backgrounds of Final Fantasy VII. However, these environments are not static in the way of their predecessors, but fully and delightfully interactive \u2013 this is a game made with real attention to detail, and clear passion for the particular period of game design. It is a sublime treat to look at, and to listen to, the sound design perfectly in keeping with the aesthetic, adding even more tension to the already grungy, bleak world we must navigate. There are two modes of play on offer at the title screen \u2013 survival, or exploration. I chose the explore mode initially, which gave me about 10 engrossing hours of gameplay. Without the grotesque, Cronenbergian beasts that roam the park, the game still holds up as a chilling adventure throughout a constantly decaying theme park universe. When a player exits a room and returns to it later, they may find it littered with corpses and bloody text on the walls. At a certain point, torrential rain begins. The lights eventually go out. The environment is truly alive, and rammed with tricky puzzles that may seem oblique at first but are highly satisfying to decode. After completing this mode, I embarked on the bloodier route \u2013 faced with the guests and other grotesque creatures of the park, the horror was suitably heightened. The combat is straightforward \u2013 shoot or run, and the game thoughtfully offers a set of control options for the gunplay so that players can choose their approach. The creatures\u2019 origins are deeply tragic and strange \u2013 but with or without their presence, the game offers great suspense. Even if you know you have elected a route where Mara won\u2019t get harmed, there is still the sense that there is something terrible lurking around every corner. This game is something of a corridor horror, and as we tunnel our way behind and below the park, things only get worse. The mystery of Crow Country was far richer than I had anticipated: the story is very completely drawn, and isn\u2019t without a little levity and playfulness in the face of the darkness. I found the final sequences really bold \u2013 committed to the strange and unsettling all the way through, it certainly sticks the landing.

Last year, Guardian Australia revealed the widespread use of stay applications to permanently halt civil cases brought by survivors where perpetrators had died. The Catholic church and other institutions effectively used the passage of time to block survivors from having their cases heard by arguing a fair trial was no longer possible. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The tactic was adopted despite clear evidence before the royal commission that significant barriers meant survivors took, on average, 22 years to come forward, and that institutions had themselves hindered justice by concealing abuse from law enforcement and destroying records. The high court delivered a significant blow to the use of stays in November, finding they must only be allowed in rare and exceptional circumstances or risk bringing \u201cthe administration of justice into disrepute\u201d. Legalise Cannabis Party upper house MLC Jeremy Buckingham is preparing to introduce a bill to state parliament to enshrine the high court findings into statute law and remove any uncertainty around the way stay applications can be used. It introduces changes that would limit the ability for a defendant to argue for a permanent stay simply because of the passage of time. The bill would also allow survivors who had a stay granted against them since 2016 the ability to have their cases reconsidered. Buckingham said he was aware of about a dozen cases that had been permanently halted due to stays in that time period. \u201cWe want justice for victims of child sexual assault,\u201d Buckingham said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want.\u201d \u201cWe want to ensure that they get their day in court, in the civil court, and that what I think [of as] this cunning \u2018lawfare\u2019 is removed as a tactic from institutions.\u201d Survivor Matt Barker said the legislation would be \u201cenormously beneficial\u201d for those who were still pursuing justice through the courts. Barker\u2019s own case against Scouts NSW was stayed last year, despite the fact that his abuser was alive, had been convicted of criminal offences against Barker, and was willing to give evidence. Barker appealed and has since settled but said he was \u201caware of other organisations still using the threats of permanent stays\u201d against other survivors. \u201c[The legislation] would be enormously beneficial for anyone who has a live case and it also has provisions for anyone whose case was closed due to a stay or because of the threat of a stay to allow them to re-litigate their case,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom that point alone, it\u2019s super important legislation because there will be so many people out there who have accepted minute settlements.\u201d The government has previously indicated support for amending the law to enshrine the high court\u2019s findings. In November, Buckingham moved a motion recognising the court ruling and to \u201cconsider enacting legislation to amend the Limitation Act 1969 to remove this roadblock to justice once and for all\u201d. The government said at the time that it \u201csupports the motion as it asks for the government to consider mechanisms and changing statute law, which we will do\u201d. Buckingham said the government was yet to act, so he was introducing the bill to force change. A spokesperson for the attorney-general Michael Daley said the government had not yet seen Buckingham\u2019s bill and had not been able to consider its contents.

Over the course of a week in June, SXSW London will take over dozens of venues, galleries, clubs and spaces in Shoreditch, east London. It will feature speeches, music, tech, gaming and screen showcases, as well as host arts, design and fashion exhibitions and immersive experiences. \u201cAs a lifelong fan of SXSW, I truly believe that it\u2019s more than an event \u2013 it\u2019s a movement, a platform where the world\u2019s greatest minds, musicians and motivators come to share their passion and their vision of the future,\u201d said Randel Bryan, the managing director of SXSW London. \u201cSXSW London will build on Austin\u2019s incredible legacy, presenting an event that underpins why SXSW is the go-to destination for professionals and creatives seeking meaningful connections, unexpected experiences and ideas that can help shape the world. \u201cSXSW London will also provide a platform for the next generation of creative talent and we will be working hard to ensure that opportunities for learning, employment and community uplift are at the heart of everything we do.\u201d Since its founding in 1987, SXSW has hosted leading speakers and participants across a multitude of disciplines, including Christiane Amanpour, Deepak Chopra, Mark Cuban, Melinda Gates, Dave Grohl, Sadiq Khan, Steven Spielberg, the Duchess of Sussex and Tilda Swinton. It has also provided opportunities for new musicians and film-makers to showcase their work, with global cultural icons such as Winehouse, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran, Skepta and Stormzy making early appearances there. Startups such as X and Uber had their first outings at the festival. SXSW London marks only the second iteration of the festival outside Austin after SXSW Sydney launched in 2023. It will be SXSW\u2019s European debut, with a particular emphasis on creative talent from across Europe. It is hoped the event will build on London\u2019s place within the community of more than 20 million people working in the creative and technology sectors across the continent, which generate billions for the economy. In the UK, the cultural and creative industries contribute \u00a3125bn, with London accounting for more than half of the country\u2019s entire creative economic output. Jann Baskett, the co-president and chief brand officer of SXSW, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to bring the SXSW experience to London. Following the success of SXSW Sydney, this is an incredible new opportunity to highlight the elements that make SXSW unique in one of the most vibrant cities in Europe. \u201cWe look forward to forming deeper connections with our overseas community and bringing the conversations that start in Austin all the way to Shoreditch.\u201d Jo Twist, the chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), said the move was \u201ca wonderful endorsement of the UK as a world-leading centre of human creativity and tech-led innovation\u201d. Tom Kiehl, the interim chief executive at UK Music, said SXSW London was \u201cnot only fantastic news for the capital and the music industry, but more generally for the UK as a whole\u201d.

The energy boss, who has come under fire after British Gas was revealed to have used debt collectors to force-fit prepayment meters in vulnerable customers\u2019 homes, said the company would be willing to install smart meters on behalf of other energy suppliers. O\u2019Shea was speaking at a parliamentary hearing on how to make energy bills more affordable just weeks after government data revealed that almost 4m smart meters have stopped working properly. He told MPs: \u201cIn order to have the proper smart grid \u2013 that is required to keep costs low in the future and have a responsive grid \u2013 everyone should have a smart meter. One of the things we should consider is whether this should be a voluntary programme or a mandatory programme. \u201cWe have 1,700 smart meter installers and we would be happy to install smart meters for Octopus, for E.On, for anybody. We would split the UK up street by street, rather than customer by customer. If you mandated it, then we could have that change in programme. It could be done within the next five years or so.\u201d O\u2019Shea\u2019s proposal was rebuffed by Rachel Fletcher, a director at the rival energy company Octopus and a veteran utilities regulator, in the same committee hearing. Fletcher said: \u201cThis should not be done to consumers. What we see [at Octopus] is people queueing up asking for a smart meter where we are offering tariffs or tools which allow them to save \u2026 hundreds of pounds a year.\u201d The government launched its smart meter programme in 2011 and had hoped to install smart meters in households across the UK before 2020 to help reach its net zero ambitions. About 60% of homes have a smart meter, according to government data. Smart meters are considered a key tool in helping households reduce their energy use. They use real-time data to make better use of renewable energy when it is available and cut the need for fossil fuels, as well as relaying instant data on households\u2019 energy use. But the programme, which is being carried out by energy suppliers, has been dogged by delays and technical faults. The government\u2019s recent data suggested that customers with smart meters may have been overcharged on their gas and electricity bills.

This form of dying comprises the withdrawal of active support, drugs and machines in patients whose further treatment is deemed futile. These patients are invariably incompetent to give consent by virtue of an impaired level of consciousness, caused by their illness and drugs. This decision is made by doctors and is legal. It is always discussed in detail with the patient\u2019s family, but the decision is not theirs to make. In law, only an individual can give consent.

Everything intangible we depend on \u2013 democracy, the rule of law, policing by trust, yadda yadda yadda \u2013 is going terrifyingly wrong. Reality has become disorientating enough without the world of entertainment spinning me out into multiple universes too. But the multiverse is having a moment (or technically many moments), what with the Marvel Cinematic Universe providing such fertile and lucrative ground for its heroes and the Oscar-winning likes of Everything Everywhere All At Once or Constellation. I\u2019ll throw Netflix\u2019s 3 Body Problem in too, because a fictional past, present and future Earth in the same storyline feels close enough. Now we have Blake Crouch\u2019s nine-part adaptation of his own book of the same name, Dark Matter. Physics professor Jason Dessen (Joel Edgerton) \u2013 hereafter known as Jason 1 \u2013 is leading a quiet life teaching then coming home each night to his loving wife, Daniela (Jennifer Connelly), and engaging teenage son Charlie (Oakes Fegley). If there is a flicker behind his eyes when his friend and college contemporary Ryan (Jimmi Simpson) wins a prestigious physics prize, well, we\u2019ve all had moments of wondering about the road not taken, have we not. It turns out that if you\u2019re a physics genius, you don\u2019t have to wonder. You can find out. So it is that Jason 1 is kidnapped and drugged by Jason 2 (Edgerton also), the version of himself that dedicated his life to science, became rich and famous, and secretly developed a way of hopping across universes to substitute himself for Jason 1 so he could enjoy all the blessings of family life and leave his other self apparently amnesiac in Jason 2\u2019s world. From there, two very enjoyable storylines unfold. One is a domestic thriller, as Jason 2 tries to avoid being unmasked as an impostor by looking up the dinner party guests he is supposed to have known for years and working out how to parent responsibly. The other is the science-fiction fun, as Jason 1 gradually deduces what has happened and sets out like a hi-tech Odysseus to journey through the multiverse to get home to Daniela 1 (even though Daniela 2, who is single in her universe, is quite the temptation to stay). Jason 1 is accompanied by Jason 2\u2019s partner Amanda (Alice Braga), a psychiatrist who has prepped previous time-travelling subjects (we don\u2019t know how well she did, as they haven\u2019t managed to return). She displays an impressive willingness to step outside her professional box and into the quantum superpositioning cube Jason 1 abandoned in its early stages but which Jason 2 went on to perfect, and to ingest the pretty much untested psychoactive compounds necessary to see and choose all available universes. Crouch and Edgerton do a fine job of making the Jasons distinct from each other yet recognisably related \u2013 two people who have evolved from the same source. This allows questions about identity, nature v nurture and whether good angels can drive the bad out to be much more intriguing than if we were simply presented with hero and villain. Alas, we viewers exist in a universe where the advice to writers that\u2019s popularly attributed to William Faulkner \u2013 \u201cKill all your darlings\u201d \u2013 is largely ignored. Crouch has made a few improvements to character arcs and closed a few loopholes from his page-turner of a book, but he has also stretched a propulsive plot that kept the physics accessible to more than nine hours that make you feel every minute. There is a lot of wheelspinning and longueurs that make you wish it was either a six-parter or perhaps a really good, tight four.

We\u2019ve had requests for Taylor Swift on a stage with a microphone in fondant, Taylor Swift riding a unicorn, Taylor Swift album covers, cakes with her face on them \u2026 The orders are very specific in the details.\u201d Beji said her team at the bakery on rue Greneta, near Les Halles shopping mall, were getting into the spirit of things. And as the countdown begins in the French capital to the arrival of the singer\u2019s Eras tour on Thursday \u2013 her first performance of a three-month European trip \u2013 they are not the only ones. Honor McWilliams, 24, a Swiftie from Glasgow who lives in Paris teaching English at the Sorbonne, can hardly contain her excitement over attending the opening concert at La D\u00e9fense, the first of four long-sold-out gigs on 9-12 May. She will also attend on Saturday with her sister Grace and two friends who are flying in from Glasgow, and will be travelling to Milan for a third concert in July. After previously seeing Swift perform in London, Glasgow, New York and Dublin \u2013 and meeting her briefly in London after being picked out of the crowd by Swift\u2019s mother \u2013 McWilliams has spent a total of \u20ac255 for the Paris tickets and has been babysitting to pay for them. \u201cTo this day my love of Taylor Swift has been a cornerstone of many of my personal, and even professional, relationships,\u201d she said. \u201cI connect so much with the French university students I teach here because of our shared love of Taylor Swift. Each week they\u2019ll ask me for my opinion on the latest Taylor Swift news, and I will find any way I can to make reference to her in lessons. One student even termed me the \u2018Taylor Swift of the Sorbonne\u2019, which may very well be the best professional compliment I will ever get.\u201d What is the core of Swift\u2019s appeal? McWilliams cites \u201cthe eloquence of the lyrics in her songs, her work ethic, gravitas, her intelligence and captivating ability to tell stories, connect with others and generate such enthusiasm.\u201d Swift\u2019s popularity has been a slow burn in France, where she gave her first concert in 2010. There was a touch of Emily in Paris to the official video for Begin Again, a 2012 song from her fourth studio album Red. Shot in Paris, it shows her as the quintessential American in Paris, writing postcards, walking on the Pont des Arts and visiting a patisserie as she meets a handsome stranger who approaches her in a cafe. She continued to associate the city with romance. The only concert to promote her 2019 album Lover, a wondrously lovestruck album written amid her relationship with the actor Joe Alwyn, was performed in Paris \u2013 a show entitled City of Lover, performed at the relatively intimate Olympia venue. She then wrote a song entitled Paris for her 2023 album Midnights, where Swift, \u201cso in love that I might stop breathing\u201d, imagines being with her partner in the city. \u201cI wanna transport you to somewhere the culture\u2019s clever\u201d, she sings, adding \u201clet the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight\u201d \u2013 a reference to the glittering light show put on by the Eiffel Tower. It all adds a certain frisson to her tour opener this week, but Prof Linda Bloss-Baum, an assistant director of the business and entertainment programme at American University\u2019s Kogod School of Business in Washington, says Swift\u2019s arrival is a big deal for any city. \u201cIt has an incredible economic impact. I know many American people who have opted to take a trip to Europe to see Taylor Swift because the tickets were more affordable. They\u2019re making a holiday of it, so it\u2019s not just the tickets, it has an economic benefit for the whole city with people staying in hotels, eating in restaurants. The ripple effect with Taylor Swift is amazing, unprecedented.\u201d She added: \u201cFrance has always been a bit of an anomaly in terms of the music business, with perhaps a little less appetite for US pop as a genre, but Taylor Swift is an exception. She seems to generate an emotional reaction from people who don\u2019t necessarily even speak English but want to be part of the phenomenon. I think what has happened is that, post-Covid pandemic, people are seeking an experience and this is the experience people want this year. It\u2019s top of their list. The average concertgoer is not holding back in spending. They\u2019re forging a lifetime marker.\u201d The Paris concerts are especially anticipated because they are the first following the release of Swift\u2019s enormously successful new album The Tortured Poets Department, which has broken a series of streaming records since its April 19 release. Fans are hoping that she will append material from the album to the Eras setlist. The conservative newspaper Le Figaro has even got in on the Swift act with an article advising desperate, ticketless Swifties on how to avoid being ripped off with fake tickets. The official price was between \u20ac69.50 and \u20ac245.50 for seats and up to \u20ac827.40 for VIP packages. Warning that resale prices were likely to be higher and could involve counterfeits, the paper warned: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t bought your ticket on an official site there\u2019s no way to easily verify the authenticity or validity of a ticket.\u201d At Clove Bakery, the team is working flat out to have all their orders ready on time. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, and not what we set out to do when we opened the bakery seven years ago, but it\u2019s also a lot of fun for the bakery team who are all young and getting involved in the excitement too,\u201d Beji said.", "date": "2024-05-08", "section": "World news", "author": "Kim Willsher in Paris", "id": 20, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4a743f69f8c1f47d7ec6fa6a3a4e4d4152fd2aaa/0_0_2767_1661/500.jpg"}]
