He served the council for 21 years, first as Labour and later a Green party representative, as well as being a Nailsworth town councillor for 14 years, including three as mayor. Norman was first elected as a Labour councillor in 1983, for the village of Leonard Stanley and then Nailsworth. He became deputy leader of the Labour group, chief whip and chair of the housing committee. Following the Iraq war, he resigned from the Labour party and was re-elected to Stroud district council as a Green councillor in 2016. Besides being chair and vice-chair, he served on a wide range of committees. A Stroud Green party spokesperson described him as \u201cirreplaceable\u201d. Born in Bethnal Green, east London, to Sylvia (nee Sidloff) and Sidney Kay, a radical Jewish family, Norman went to Hackney Downs grammar school. He became politically active as a teenager, serving as secretary of Hackney Independent Labour party. After a spell of taxi driving in London, he studied sociology and political science under Zygmunt Bauman at Leeds University and was elected to the student union executive committee. After graduation, he became a social worker in Doncaster in 1973, then Bristol in 1976, and, finally, Gloucestershire, from the early 1980s to 2006. With his wife, Kate (nee Berry), whom he met at university and married in 1971, and some friends he established a socialist/feminist bookshop in Bristol called Full Marks. Master\u2019s degrees in social administration under Peter Townsend (Bristol University, 80s) and public administration (Birmingham University, 90s), and a degree in chemistry (Open University, 2000s) followed. By the 90s, Norman was managing his own adult and mental health social work team. He was accredited as a specialist in mental health early in his time at Bristol. A kind, gentle and principled man, Norman was widely respected across his community. He could \u201cdisagree agreeably\u201d, and worked constructively with a wide range of groups, of different political views and none. A committed member of the council\u2019s equality, diversity and inclusion working group, he was its chair in 2021. He was actively involved in Stroud\u2019s Gay Pride and Holocaust Memorial days and supported anti-slavery initiatives, including the removal of the Blackboy clock in Stroud. He also supported calls for Palestinian rights. Norman collected for the poppy appeal every year and served on the Cotswolds area of outstanding natural beauty committee. He was active in promoting the Stroud show and liked to exhibit his own rare breed Cotswold sheep locally. Norman and Kate also had a goat, horses and pigs. He was still looking after his livestock up to last year. A keen racing supporter, he was a member of Cheltenham racecourse. I met Norman at a constituency Labour party meeting in Stroud, where Kate and I shared the role of constituency secretary. He and I were friends for 40 years. Norman is survived by Kate, and his sister, Frances.", "date": "2024-01-14", "section": "Society", "author": "Joy Greenwood", "id": 0, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/932ea6e3cb1eb20b45aa0b30beffc6f32226e3f6/0_89_1262_757/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Kim\u2019s Convenience review \u2013 popcorn retail therapy spun from sitcom", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/jan/14/kims-convenience-review-park-theatre-london-ins-choi", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.057, "neu": 0.729, "pos": 0.213, "compound": 0.9918}, "body": "Before Kim\u2019s Convenience became a hit Netflix series, it was a play on the Toronto fringe. Now, Ins Choi\u2019s comedy drama turned sitcom, about the travails of a Korean Canadian family running a convenience store, returns to theatrical form but feels like a melange of two media. The cast is not that of the TV show, and Choi himself plays outspoken father, Appa, but the production has the uncanny, slightly confusing, look and feel of a live TV studio recording. It is a smooth machine of a show nonetheless: its comedy works, its acting superb, its story warm but not too mawkish and its characters lovable even when they border on the prejudiced, like Appa. Masterfully directed by Esther Jun, this is popcorn theatre: we could go on watching and watching. The story crunches strands from across the five series into 80 minutes. Beneath the comedy are themes of immigration, parental sacrifice and the gulf between Appa and his children. There is his daughter, Janet (Jennifer Kim), whom he wants to divert from photography into running the shop, and his estranged son, Jung (Brian Law), who left home years ago. Janet feels like the focus here, her romance with police officer Alex (Miles Mitchell) lifted from the first series, and Kim plays her with feisty energy. Choi is fantastic as Appa but wife Umma (Namju Go) is shadowy, not nearly as characterful as on screen. Mona Camille\u2019s set is such an exact replica of a local supermarket, with its lotto card advert, drinks fridge and linoleum-covered aisles, it is its own wonder. The delight is in the detail, right down to the sound of the electric bell as customers enter an invisible door. For fans of the TV show, there is deja vu in some scenes which are also exact replicas, such as the skit about the Honda parked outside which reveals Appa\u2019s grudge against the Japanese (\u201cIn 1904 Japan attacked Korea\u201d), and the \u201csteal or no steal\u201d scene, involving a Black man whom Appa identifies as a thief, and is one example of the show\u2019s edgy race satire. These scenes carry the sense of a show delivering its \u201cbest bits\u201d rather than offering something entirely original. Yet it works, and is still funny the second time around \u2013 as a repeat episode of Friends might be. Theatre has increasingly started to adapt television shows or feel episodic in their script.

Warming up a largely sedate audience in Cadogan Hall for Australian guitar virtuoso Tommy Emmanuel, by the time she\u2019d finished with them, they were awakened rangers ready to grab the bull by the horns. Renowned for her acrobatic skill with the guitar, effortlessly moving from crosspicking to flatpicking and clawhammer strums (\u201cI know we\u2019re all guitar nerds here\u201d), she plays it with the ease of meeting an old friend. Though her fables of life on the open road, matters of the heart and cannabis farmers in the Blue Ridge Mountains are usually embroidered by her band Golden Highway, tonight, she plays solo \u2013 but this is far from a stripped-back performance. She mines the instrument for the bass and rhythm in remarkable self-sufficiency, galloping through the valleys of El Dorado and San Joaquin drawn from her latest album City of Gold. Tuttle may know how to sing the high lonesome, but she performs her songs grinning ear to ear as if letting you in on a secret, often throwing in a wink for good measure. Her rendition of the sprightly sing-along Side Saddle, an anthem of spirited independence defying those who say \u201ca girl can\u2019t ride\u201d, has the fun and intimacy of a campfire jam. Calling on bluegrass camaraderie, her audience, at first placid, were now all too willing to take up her invitation to whistle along.

Sixty dancers, musicians and singers, four new music and dance works and a stunning setting, formerly part of the Royal Arsenal, with a catwalk-like stage bisecting the room. It\u2019s loaded with ambition and class, not just the ingredients but the way the whole evening is designed. We start with two musical works: the hushed echoes of Andrea Balency-B\u00e9arn\u2019s Appels, then baritone Ross Ramgobin singing Yshani Perinpanayagam\u2019s setting of John Cage\u2019s love letters to Merce Cunningham. \u201cMy dearest Merce, I\u2019m writing a new piece ... and the only one I can imagine listening to it is you.\u201d The dancers are woven into the music before setting out on their own adventure, each piece follows the next without pause (or applause) building an absorbing atmosphere absolutely fitting the mood of the central feature, Les Noces. The original Les Noces \u2013 music by Stravinsky, dance by Bronislava Nijinska \u2013 premiered a century ago, the story of a Russian peasant wedding, it\u2019s a chilling picture of a forced marriage and a powerful piece of protofeminism. This new work, choreographed collectively by the performers, leans on ideas of community and its dutiful or surprising bonds, the dancers entangled or drawn together in unison, picking out rhythms from the musical layers, while individuals briefly break free from the group. The dancers of New Movement Collective are mostly veterans of Rambert, with decades of embodied knowledge between them and their movement carries weight and purpose and nothing superfluous, unfussy lines like the well-ironed seams of their nicely tailored costumes. In fleeting imagery, their bolero jackets become props, tied into a rope or a bride\u2019s veil and train. But against the power of the original Les Noces, the strength of the theme and innovation of the language feels a little pale. Stravinsky\u2019s score, played in the original arrangement for four pianos and percussion, with the chorus of Opera Holland Park, is adrenalised and ominous. Excellent soprano soloist April Koyejo-Audiger gets it: the urgency, her ringing notes that impel you, \u201cListen!\u201d There\u2019s a lot to love in this richly interesting evening. \u2022 At Woolwich Works, 14 January", "date": "2024-01-14", "section": "Stage", "author": "Lyndsey Winship", "id": 3, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a6b1bb78ca910d97a58ecb806f51b7f1d6321e17/0_224_4545_2727/500.jpg"}, {"title": "The January transfer window is open\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/jan/14/eva-wiseman-the-january-transfer-window-is-for-life-not-just-football", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.136, "neu": 0.631, "pos": 0.233, "compound": 0.9949}, "body": "Ah January. Too many vowels, too little time, it rises baldly on the horizon, an awkward and needy wasteland. And we dash around upon it as if walking the dogs of our regrets, searching for our new selves in its bleak whiteness and swinging our dainty plastic bags of shit. We are looking for meaning or, failing that, some kind of structure within which we can enable change. A game, a routine, to help each other move forward with purpose. I have a suggestion. Forget new year resolutions, forget dry January (which mad cow came up with this, by the way, this idea that January, a month of relentless rain, anxiety and sorrow, would be a good time to face reality head on, without even a colourful cocktail to take the edge off? Without even a little paper umbrella to protect us?). Instead, embrace the January transfer window. As in football, so in life \u2013 you have one month in which to barter and negotiate to create a new identity; a better, sleeker, more winning you. The deadline for decisions is dead strict and counted down live on clocks across the internet. There is something inspiring about the urgency, the pressure. It becomes its own sport. But I am less interested in the million pound fates of Jadon Sancho or Aaron Ramsdale than I am in the urgent reshaping of mine and my friends\u2019 lives. These are the teams I support. These are the athletes who I will trek out in the rain for and stand shivering and singing for even as they lose. Their pain and their happiness and their decisions about paint colours for the bedroom, this is my sport, this is why I scroll, refresh, refresh. After a season of shared colds and bickering in Tescos along the south coast, many are eyeing relationship transfers, kissing a stranger in the smoking area, setting into motion the dramatic denouement of their current marriage. January is an excellent time to make your substitutions. Is it time? Look around. If you\u2019re ready to find a new lover, simply everybody else will look hot. That hiker in the head-to-toe waterproofs muttering there\u2019s no such thing as bad weather \u2013 yes. The suspicious checkout assistant who keeps their eyebrow fully raised when you\u2019re trying to return an unwanted gift from your cousin \u2013 yes. The delivery driver who asks if they can use your loo and fills the house with the smell of smoked meat \u2013 yes. Perhaps, instead of simply ushering in a replacement partner, you want to restructure the relationship itself and investigate polyamory, or consensual non-monogamy, or create a throuple or some other form of many syllabled entanglement. While news of such flexible experiments delights me, when I think about participating in such a relationship myself I am reminded of someone recently describing the special pain of cooking with garlic and how each clove has its own paperwork. But this admin is what the transfer window is perfect for: negotiate your terms, organise a medical and usher in a new signing, or a whole new team. I had a haircut recently, which, returning home, was a shock for a number of reasons, the most lasting being the realisation that I do not present as the person I believe I am. When I asked for a short, messy bob, I assumed the hairdresser would look at me and understand what I meant. That she would see, if not quite a mischievous young punk, then at least someone with memories of nighttimes past, rather than, as became clear when I looked in the mirror at the end after she\u2019d sculpted what she assumed was an appropriate cut, a middle-aged mum who had to rush back to get tea on. It has spurred me to pay more attention to my appearance and use this transfer window to switch out my current look, a sort of \u201cslouching towards Brent Cross\u201d and replace it with something altogether more chic and dynamic. Rather than dieting or detoxing or any of that absolute silliness, what I am planning to do is alter the look in my eyes. Out with jolly exhaustion and in with a steely gaze, alert, reckless, a certain wild suspense. I am spending January learning how to style this new haircut less cosily, I am throwing out another bag of jumpers and I am adopting a new walk, the walk of somebody taller who has made better decisions. I am using eye cream at night and tanning drops in the day. In February, I intend to return to the hairdresser and test my new squad, by which, of course, I mean, see if this fresh combination of dignity and sass will lead to me emerging with the hair of a modern Debbie Harry, rather than Debbie, Harry\u2019s mum who always wears a travel bumbag containing a massive set of keys. Join me. Switch out grand ambition for focused slog, swap tired pettiness for rich passion, untested prejudices for educated compassion, buy in the bravery to be disliked, switch in pleasure: drink, smoke, sleep, sell off abstinence, bitterness, guilt. March out on to the pitch in February transformed \u2013 bigger, better, stronger, in a chic little haircut and absolutely exquisite shorts.

She was a dancer before she was a writer and you can feel the commitment to the fire of bodily motion in her masterpieces: the shimmeringly brutal excavation of girlhood and violence in Jane, the story of her aunt\u2019s killing at the hands of a rapist; the clear-headed yet ecstatic celebration of the transformations of pregnancy and top surgery, and the new kind of family she and her trans partner brought into being in The Argonauts (2015). Her dedication to the material finds the forms it needs; I don\u2019t think she sets out to bend genres. Instead, her high-stakes eviscerations of body settle into radically new forms. Is this the energy of the rebel or the valedictorian? For decades, Nelson has parted her hair, fastened her top button, won the right grades and grants while throwing herself voluptuously into the counterculture, dreaming of being an \u201celectric ribbon of horniness and divine grace\u201d like one of her inspirations, Prince. It\u2019s an American energy \u2013 expansive, new, full of power, pleasure, change and motion; a frontier energy, even when she\u2019s writing about New York. We can hear Whitman behind her, and Emerson. \u201cPower ceases in the instant of repose,\u201d Emerson pronounces in Self-Reliance; \u201cit resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of a gulf, in the darting to an aim.\u201d A decade after The Argonauts became the bible of English graduates everywhere, the essays in Like Love arrive to help us understand Nelson\u2019s place in a culture where, to her half-delight, she has become such a powerful voice. Spanning two decades, they range from appreciations of influences including Prince and Judith Butler, to wild, freefalling conversations with figures such as Bj\u00f6rk, Wayne Koestenbaum and Jacqueline Rose. There is a passionate, wondering account of her formative half-erotic friendship with the singer Lhasa de Sela. The writing isn\u2019t consistent, any more than her books are. But I like to take my thinkers and writers whole, as she does. The essays offer a kind of composite self-portrait, and illustrate how she thinks, sometimes painstakingly, sometimes with casual jubilance, about some of the central dilemmas of our time. In the face of the climate crisis, how to avoid \u201cgiving in to the narcissistic spectacle of the slo-mo Titanic going down\u201d? In the face of the crisis in feminism, how and whether to move beyond sexual difference? The written exchanges show her interlocutors thinking it through, too. \u201cYou dare to step into the future like no one else atm,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk says. It\u2019s true. This is where all that restless energy is leading. This is why she\u2019s an Emersonian, shying away from nihilism. \u201cThere are new lands, new men, new thoughts,\u201d Emerson wrote in Nature, discarding the \u201cdry bones\u201d of his ancestors; \u201cLet us demand our own works and laws and worship.\u201d In her powerful piece on the artist Carolee Schneemann, Nelson posits her as a female incarnation of Emerson\u2019s self-reliant man. But it\u2019s Nelson herself who proffers new laws and worship \u2013 whose project amounts to a practical philosophy of contemporary American culture. In The Argonauts she offers the gift of a future we can somehow share; one that acknowledges the miseries of the present, that has space for dreams, but is obstinately material and in our world. Here, in dialogue with Jacqueline Rose, she proposes that \u201cEverybody deserves the kind of non-stultifying internal breathing space of fluidity or instability that is attributed to queers, or to women, or whatever.\u201d Like Love\u2019s title comes from theatre critic Hilton Als\u2019s vision of a group on the subway not as white women or black men but as mouths that need filling \u201cwith something wet or dry, like love, or unfamiliar and savory, like love\u201d. Nelson, too, is drawn to mouths \u2013 to orifices in general \u2013 as organs of pleasure and pain, and as portals enabling a radical openness. Because Nelson likes writing about her friends, there\u2019s a kind of homogeneity to much of the book that cumulatively left me feeling a little claustrophobic, longing especially for the roominess of time travel. With the exception of 2009\u2019s Bluets, Nelson\u2019s writing is so located in the postwar world that the past can feel entirely absent. This is her affinity with Emerson and Whitman again \u2013 her song to the future \u2013 but I wonder if I\u2019m alone in wishing that, alongside those two often acknowledged ancestors, her future could have artists, activists and libertines from earlier centuries informing it, too. Which is not to say that she\u2019s wrong to write about the people in her circle. The brutality of the present moment may require us precisely to batten down the hatches and commit to extreme solidarity. At a time when institutional life is collapsing, when the pandemic privileged family over friends, when work expands in ways that leave many too exhausted to socialise, Nelson demonstrates what it means to dedicate yourself to a cohort with seriousness and strenuousness. \u201cYou, to me, quickly became an inspiration,\u201d she tells the poet Brian Blanchfield, \u201ca brother, a support in times of seriously dark waters, an editor, a lender of excellent and pivotal books, a cheerleader, a colleague, a couch sleeper (and couch mover), a fellow swimmer \u2026 a corrupting gambler, (queer) family.\u201d Like Love may be one of the most movingly specific, the most lovingly unruly celebrations of the ethics of friendship we have. \u2022 Lara Feigel is the author of Look!

It was one of many such announcements in 2024, but this case is especially egregious because Take-Two ownsRockstar Games, which publishes Grand Theft Auto, AKA the most successful game in the history of the world, and is definitely not short of profits. Last week, Bloomberg (\u00a3) reported on internal documentation showing the likely victims of these cuts: studios Intercept Games in Seattle and Roll7 in London are set to close. Both are part of Private Division, the giant publisher\u2019s indie game label. I spent some time with Intercept\u2019s Kerbal Space Program 2 last year, when they were gearing up to launch. This exceptionally nerdy game about getting tiny green astronauts into space, which hews so closely to the real life physics of space flight that it inspired a generation of engineering students, has had a troubled time. It had been through a studio closure and a change of developer already, and its early-access launch did not exactly go without a hitch (Rock Paper Shotgun called it a \u201chot mess\u201d). Kerbal Space Program 2 deserves a chance to turn things around, but it is understandable why its developer ended up on the block. Roll7, meanwhile, was only acquired by Take-Two in 2021, and has released two successful and critically acclaimed games since. OlliOlli World is a fantastic, stylish cartoon skateboarding game with oodles of personality. And the similarly slick-looking Rollerdrome (pictured below), an arena deathmatch game on rollerskates, won a Bafta last year for best British game. Roll7 has a 15-year history of interesting and \u2013 crucially! \u2013 profitable games, most based on interesting and original ideas: Not a Hero was a 2D cover shooter where you were sent out to assassinate criminals by a purple bunny; Laser League was an arena combat-sports game inspired by Tron. Every studio closure is a tragedy for the people affected, but this one feels personally gutting. I\u2019ve played Roll7\u2019s games for more than a decade, starting with the superbly intricate 2D skateboarding game OlliOlli, which obsessed me on my PlayStation Vita for most of 2014 \u2013 and they are really good. OlliOlli World (pictured above) is tremendous. I\u2019ve also met (and interviewed) several of the people at Roll7 over the years, and it was a developer with a unique creative culture. It absolutely sucks to lose a studio like this. But it\u2019s also such an insulting rug pull for a studio that, until a few years ago, was getting by as an independent outfit. When Eurogamer interviewed the studio\u2019s leadership shortly after the 2K acquisition, co-founder John Ribbins seemed palpably relieved to have been acquired by a big publisher, because he thought it came with a certain level of safety. This news is an unwelcome reminder that there is no such thing as safety in the games industry, even if your studio is successful by any measure, making acclaimed and successful award-winning games. Most of the world\u2019s big publishers now operate on an extreme \u201cgo big or go home\u201d basis that leaves no room for anything that isn\u2019t grotesquely profitable. When even a studio like Roll7 can\u2019t count on the support of a company like Take-Two, can anyone? Take-Two still hasn\u2019t officially confirmed the closure, though. \u201cOn April 16th, Take-Two announced a cost reduction program to identify efficiencies across its business and to enhance the Company\u2019s margin profile, while still investing for growth,\u201d reads its statement. \u201cAs part of these efforts, the Company is rationalising its pipeline and eliminating several projects in development and streamlining its organisational structure, which will eliminate headcount and reduce future hiring needs. The Company is not providing additional details on this program.\u201d The kind of games and studios that are being \u201crationalised\u201d out of existence here are exactly the kind that we need in 2024: smaller, creatively interesting games that offer alternatives to the increasingly homogeneous gaming behemoths that have been hoovering up money for more than 10 years. Roll7\u2019s releases are exactly the kinds of games that should form part of an artistically as well as monetarily valuable portfolio for a publisher such as Take-Two. Grand Theft Auto prints money, and the publisher\u2019s executives take home tens of millions every year. Is it actually true now that such a publisher can\u2019t support smaller games, too \u2013 even if they win awards and turn a profit? What is the point of having an \u201cindie\u201d publishing label if you\u2019re simply going to buy good studios and shut them down after barely two years? This is another cautionary tale about the vandalism that gaming\u2019s biggest corporations can enact on the studios they acquire, and I feel as incensed by it as I did by Microsoft\u2019s closure of Lionhead in 2016. As this newsletter went to press, IGN reported the equally devastating news that Microsoft is to shutter Tango Gameworks, makers of the brilliant and interesting Hi-Fi Rush and unique Japanese ghost story Ghostwire Tokyo, along with Arkane Austin \u2013 whose latest game, Redfall, was a flop, but which previously had a hand in some of the most critically acclaimed games of the last generation. Gigantic, samey games played by tens of millions of people should not be the entire future of video games. Creative developers deserve better than this, and so do we. What to play Styled like a lost PlayStation 1 classic, Crow Country is a horror adventure game in which you explore an abandoned theme park full of mutated \u2026 guests, and it is really creepy, right down to the lo-fi rattling and squelching and creaking of all the old attractions. Even without all the mutants, this theme park itself is horrible! Why would anyone have come here? I particularly admire the dedication to the mid-90s low-poly fuzzy-around-the-edges look, which recalls the best of this era of horror games without the endless loading times, annoying controls and inventory management. If you like the sound of this game\u2019s premise but are, like me, a total coward, I have good news: you can play the game in a mode with no enemies, so you can solve the puzzles and soak up the horrible ambience without the constant threat. Available on: PC, PlayStation 5 Estimated playtime: Less than five hours What to read PlayStation has had an unpleasant week. After its breakout hit Helldivers 2 (above) sold millions on PC, the company demanded that PC players sign up for a PlayStation Network account in order to continue playing. This resulted in a player revolt, the game being removed from sale in 177 countries where PSN is not operational, more than 100,000 negative Steam reviews and, eventually, an ignominious climbdown. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning what is best for PC players,\u201d read Sony\u2019s statement. That much is blindingly obvious. The bigger Florida version of the Universal Studios Nintendo theme park is shaping up pretty well. That Donkey Kong-themed Mine Cart rollercoaster looks just the right amount of terrifying. In more \u201cbig publishers are terrible at fostering creativity\u201d news, a video from DidYouKnowGaming\u2019s Liam Robertson (via Kotaku) lays out how US studio Vicarious Visions was ultimately prevented from working on a whole bunch of interesting projects, from a Donkey Kong 3D platformer to more remasters of the Tony Hawk skateboarding games, in favour of \u2026 yet more Call of Duty.

By contrast, I was amazed how Untitled Goose Game captures an esoteric British village perfectly, with no speaking characters and relatively simple shapes. Can you recommend any other games that faithfully represent regions on a small-scale?\u201d Alba: A Wildlife Adventure is one of these for me (with the important caveat that I have never been to Valencia, where it is set). It portrays a small island community and the people, birds, colours and geography of the place feel so intimate and believable. A Highland Song, meanwhile, depicts a place with which I am intimately familiar: the mountains and austere coast of Scotland. Its perfect light and rough brushstrokes communicate the unforgiving beauty of my home country so gorgeously. And there\u2019s the Yakuza/Like a Dragon series, whose perfect re-creations of Japanese cities heave with life. I\u2019d love to hear from readers on this one: what games set in real places have done a great job of conjuring their spirit?

Still in my teens, I wore through the carpet doing her workout videos in front of the TV. I also spent hours ploughing up and down the pool at the local leisure centre and honing my muscles at the gym. I always regarded fitness as my superpower. Something that I worked hard at, for sure, but something that gave me kudos. Keeping fit \u2013 I mean, really fit \u2013 seemed to me an admirable and noble pursuit. I could fit into nice clothes easily. I could push my body and trust it not to fail. Whatever other qualities I didn\u2019t possess, whatever I wasn\u2019t good enough at, I could walk into a gym or toe a start line for a race and pass muster. I trained to be a personal trainer, so I could guide others to their \u201cfitness goals\u201d. But it was running that really got me, quickly becoming part of my identity. I ran my first marathon aged 22 \u2013 and went on to become a coach, write books about running and host running retreats. Running may look like freedom, but it can also be about control. Distances must be covered, paces maintained, pounds shed, personal bests (PBs) bettered. I now see that latching on to the pursuit of fitness so young was a way of imposing control on my body, of searching for approval and bringing order to my unravelling family life. It worked, too. But it also became a habit. Like a magic suit, a fit body protects you from others\u2019 scorn, as well as worries about the usual concerns of ageing, such as weight gain and failing health. But it takes time, energy and discipline to achieve and maintain such a body, requiring rules and restraint that can be life-limiting and reek of patriarchal control. I was in thrall to fitness for three decades. But, when lockdown happened, when gyms, athletics tracks, swimming pools and running clubs closed, when sporting events were cancelled, when I was limited to solitary runs, a feeling crept over me. What was it all for? One day, in that endlessly glorious spring, I was running along the riverbank. Running had begun to feel joyless and unusually laboured. That point, a few miles in, when you can step aside from the physicality of the endeavour and just let it happen was proving elusive. I was present, every jarring, heavy-footed step of the way, my cadence spelling out what for, what for, what for? I tried to push through it \u2013 until, suddenly, neither my body nor my brain could find a reason to carry on. I slowed to a walk. I stopped my watch. I sat down and had a little cry, the sweat drying on my back. Then I walked home. It wasn\u2019t a one-off. While I continued to go through the motions, my dedication to fitness felt increasingly hollow. And, frankly, shallow. As Sarah Donaghy said, when I interviewed her about Food Bank Run: \u201cRunning can be a solitary \u2013 even selfish \u2013 endeavour, with its focus on individual performance and PBs.\u201d While I struggled on throughout that summer, squeezing myself into running like a garment that no longer fitted, I began to regard it as a ball and chain, a drain on my resources. This was a big inconvenience for someone whose career was largely built around running. Eventually, I could no longer ignore the questions my body and mind were raising. My search for answers led me to reconsider not just my attitude to my body and to running, but to life itself. To finding meaning and purpose, to achievement and ageing and to that ultimate finish line, mortality. Ageing, without doubt, played its part in this shift. I turned 50 in 2019, and I was beginning to realise that the absence of new PBs wasn\u2019t some kind of temporary blip \u2013 it was terminal. Try as you might, you cannot compete with the 30-year-old you, or the 40-year-old you. If running is no longer about improvement, achievement, what can it be, I wondered. What am I getting out of it? What am I putting in? Is there something else I should be doing instead? For many, this is the point where age grading comes to the fore \u2013 many people get great pleasure from being \u201cgood for your age\u201d. A part of me has great admiration for the 80- to 90-year-olds training for Masters competitions and pursuing every possible marginal gain. But, as the planet and its human and non-human inhabitants face climate breakdown and all the injustice, inequality, exploitation and loss that comes with it, I can\u2019t help wondering if all that energy could be put to better use. I stopped running altogether for a while, and was appalled when I could no longer fit into some of my clothes. The shame of my expanding, softening body almost lured me back in, but, once again, my body rebelled, voting, quite literally, with its feet. \u201cDon\u2019t want to slip back into being governed by running,\u201d I wrote in my diary. \u201cDo you really want to be the same person you were a year ago, five years ago, instead of moving forward?\u201d Four years on, I am less fit than I was. I cannot assume the same protective benefits of fitness on my health. I can\u2019t automatically pick up size 10 garments, nor assume that I can do parkrun in under 22 minutes. Not being able to do these things any longer feels uncomfortable \u2013 as uncomfortable as having a visible tummy. But there are benefits, too. All that energy I poured into fitness for three decades is mine again. I think more, I notice more, I write more, I have wider interests. I finished a part-time MA last year, and I volunteer in conservation work. I am more aware of the world around me, good and bad. In his essay How to Live With Dying, the philosopher and lifelong avid runner John Kaag writes how a cardiac arrest, minutes after finishing a punishing treadmill run, changed his perspective on life. \u201cAt a certain point, going the extra mile does not make you a better athlete. It just makes you an idiot,\u201d he says. There\u2019s still the odd pang for my old fitness level, my former body \u2013 and even for the rigours of the pursuit itself. But, whatever I may have lost, I\u2019ve gained so much more. \u201cIn the end,\u201d writes Kaag, \u201cmost of us wish we\u2019d spent less time on the treadmill, whatever form it might take.\u201d", "date": "2024-05-08", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Sam Pyrah", "id": 9, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/df5fb44fe28b36fb6e7a26059c2df7126034ad02/0_93_3024_1815/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Dawn of the Big Yin: rediscovered film shows Billy Connolly on the road to comedy glory", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/may/08/big-yin-billy-connolly-big-banana-feet-documentary-film-comedy", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.1, "neu": 0.671, "pos": 0.229, "compound": 0.9959}, "body": "In an age where our every selfie, photogenic breakfast and \u201cthing I\u2019m ashamed to admit\u201d is preserved eternally online, it\u2019s a shock to recall that actual art was once disposable \u2013 and prone to getting lost. Big Banana Feet, a documentary chronicling the Irish leg of Billy Connolly\u2019s 1975 UK tour, was consigned more or less to oblivion when its distributor later went bust, and director Murray Grigor left his own personal copy with a friend in the US, never to be seen again. Until now: the film was rediscovered four years ago in an archive at the University of California, and is being re-released by the BFI in a lovingly restored print. It\u2019s quite the time capsule, with its endless fag-smoking and a backstage sequence \u2013 oh, the glamour! \u2013 featuring Belfast tea ladies and their slow-pouring pot of tea. It\u2019s also an absorbing portrait of Britain\u2019s most influential comic as he teeters on the brink of megastardom. Inspired, says Grigor, by DA Pennebaker\u2019s film of Bob Dylan\u2019s 1965 UK tour, Don\u2019t Look Back, it follows the Glaswegian on what was then (shortly after his famous 1975 Parkinson appearance) the biggest domestic tour ever undertaken by a solo artist, as he performs first in Dublin then in Belfast. It\u2019s gorgeous to see him here so young and full of life, palpably a people\u2019s person \u2013 chewing the fat with squaddies, the support act, those tea ladies \u2013 even as he begins to withdraw, as you\u2019d have to, from the growing celebrity clamour. The Belfast gigs are particularly noteworthy, because the city was a dangerous one to visit at the time. Members of a touring cabaret band had been killed in an attack by the UVF months previously. Major stars had cancelled the Northern Ireland leg of their tours. Connolly\u2019s insistence that these gigs go ahead was a kind of cultural lifeline for the province, beating a path where others could follow. You can watch Big Banana Feet for the socio-politics, then, and find it fascinating. But you can watch it for the comedy, too \u2013 or for the moments where they meet. At one point, a Belfast audience member hands Connolly a red rose. He accepts with gratitude \u2013 then mimes the explosion that would ensue (\u201cboooom!\u201d) if the rose somehow concealed a bomb. A risky gag \u2013 but not as risky as had he performed his anti-army song Sergeant, Where\u2019s Mine in Belfast, which, mid-gig, he opts not to do. I\u2019m not here to remind them of the Troubles, Connolly later argues, but to make them laugh. But not just make them laugh. One of the attractions of the documentary is that it finds Connolly at a pivotal moment of self-definition. We see several interviews with journalists, trying to pin down the Big Yin phenomenon as it forms. One marvels \u2013 a sign of the times, this \u2013 that \u201cyou don\u2019t even have an exciting stage name, you sound like the boy next door\u201d. Others oblige Connolly to defend the vulgarity that supposedly characterises his routine about swearing on TV (still a novel idea in 1975), or his song toying with the delights of the Four-Letter Word. It\u2019s a plus \u00e7a change moment as Connolly \u2013 like many a comic today \u2013 advises that people who might be offended should simply stay away. Then another journo pitches in: \u201cAre you a comedian or an entertainer?\u201d And Connolly doesn\u2019t have a ready answer. Both? Neither? \u201cA comic singer,\u201d he goes for, if only to get the guy off his back. I love that he doesn\u2019t know. This was a time before \u201cstandup comedy\u201d had taken its current shape, and before everything was commodified and marketed to the point of calcification. Connolly clearly didn\u2019t feel the modern pressure to refine his brand, and onstage, he did what he liked: politics and ridiculous fruit footwear, soulful ballads like Sergeant, Where\u2019s Mine and standup about farting, all in the same show. Showing us something special in genesis, back when touring comedy was barely a thing, Big Banana Feet is a great rediscovery.

My particular experience is working with the youngest children as they begin learning to read. Since 2021, schools in England have been required to follow the highly prescriptive systematic synthetic phonics (SSP) scheme. The \u201cfully decodable\u201d books approved for SSP schemes must focus on the spelling pattern to be learned, usually at the expense of a good story or any literary merit. Right from the start of school, enjoyment of books is being squeezed out. However, your contention that the curriculum model of little blocks of tightly controlled content is \u201cmore suited to science and maths\u201d must be challenged. My other role is as a maths tutor to teenagers. I find that they have been rushed to learn ever more complicated formulas and procedures without time to investigate ideas, to make links between topics or to develop thinking skills. Mathematics is a deeply creative subject. Advances are made by finding new ways of thinking rather than by applying known formulae. Just as with English, the current fact-heavy GCSE and A-level maths curriculums squeeze out the joy of learning. A general curriculum review is needed. The soul has been knocked out of the English curriculum, but mathematics has been just as badly served. Ruth Allen Nottingham \u2022 It was so cheering to read your call for the pleasure of reading to be restored to the classroom. We all get the joy of sharing a picture book with young children, looking at the pictures, laughing together, perhaps enjoying the rhyme as we talk the words off the page. But for many children, that simple joy of reading gets lost when they learn to read. They have to work hard to sound words out, and the story can become dull and restricted by what phonic sounds they are able to recognise. Language is stripped down to its component parts, reading becomes a chore, and parents and children get trapped in a reading battle. Many schools are shifting the tide on this, and classrooms and corridors are beginning to buzz with reading-friendly spaces, brilliant books are positioned to tempt and children are encouraged to chat about their reading choices. But it\u2019s an uphill battle. Let\u2019s support schools, parents and carers to get children back to a place of sharing a book because they really want to. The benefits to all are clear. Amy Lewis Head of Coram Beanstalk \u2022 I couldn\u2019t agree more with your editorial. I have taught English at secondary level for almost 50 years. For the first 25 years or so, the text was king. We read, discussed, engaged, argued, talked about life, society, morality, emotion \u2013 literally everything writers write about. Then, gradually and insidiously, the assessment objectives and mark schemes usurped the text. Thinking and responding gave way to spotting. It became less important to discuss why Hamlet asks \u201cTo be or not to be?\u201d and what that suggests about the human condition, and more important to identify the rhetorical device Shakespeare used. Teachers became obliged to value what could be measured rather than continuing to teach what is valuable, and the subject became a shadow of its former self.

A survival horror game about the dark secrets lurking within and beneath an abandoned theme park, it is also a gorgeous homage to landmark games of the past. The look of the game is breathtaking: the thick, grainy patina over the screen gives the impression of playing on a CRT monitor in somebody\u2019s dimly lit bedroom in 1997. The chunky polygonal figure of the protagonist, the mysterious Mara Forest, serves a stark contrast against the set and landscape, which give the impression of the lush pre-rendered backgrounds of Final Fantasy VII. However, these environments are not static in the way of their predecessors, but fully and delightfully interactive \u2013 this is a game made with real attention to detail, and clear passion for the particular period of game design. It is a sublime treat to look at, and to listen to, the sound design perfectly in keeping with the aesthetic, adding even more tension to the already grungy, bleak world we must navigate. There are two modes of play on offer at the title screen \u2013 survival, or exploration. I chose the explore mode initially, which gave me about 10 engrossing hours of gameplay. Without the grotesque, Cronenbergian beasts that roam the park, the game still holds up as a chilling adventure throughout a constantly decaying theme park universe. When a player exits a room and returns to it later, they may find it littered with corpses and bloody text on the walls. At a certain point, torrential rain begins. The lights eventually go out. The environment is truly alive, and rammed with tricky puzzles that may seem oblique at first but are highly satisfying to decode. After completing this mode, I embarked on the bloodier route \u2013 faced with the guests and other grotesque creatures of the park, the horror was suitably heightened. The combat is straightforward \u2013 shoot or run, and the game thoughtfully offers a set of control options for the gunplay so that players can choose their approach. The creatures\u2019 origins are deeply tragic and strange \u2013 but with or without their presence, the game offers great suspense. Even if you know you have elected a route where Mara won\u2019t get harmed, there is still the sense that there is something terrible lurking around every corner. This game is something of a corridor horror, and as we tunnel our way behind and below the park, things only get worse. The mystery of Crow Country was far richer than I had anticipated: the story is very completely drawn, and isn\u2019t without a little levity and playfulness in the face of the darkness. I found the final sequences really bold \u2013 committed to the strange and unsettling all the way through, it certainly sticks the landing.

Last year, Guardian Australia revealed the widespread use of stay applications to permanently halt civil cases brought by survivors where perpetrators had died. The Catholic church and other institutions effectively used the passage of time to block survivors from having their cases heard by arguing a fair trial was no longer possible. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The tactic was adopted despite clear evidence before the royal commission that significant barriers meant survivors took, on average, 22 years to come forward, and that institutions had themselves hindered justice by concealing abuse from law enforcement and destroying records. The high court delivered a significant blow to the use of stays in November, finding they must only be allowed in rare and exceptional circumstances or risk bringing \u201cthe administration of justice into disrepute\u201d. Legalise Cannabis Party upper house MLC Jeremy Buckingham is preparing to introduce a bill to state parliament to enshrine the high court findings into statute law and remove any uncertainty around the way stay applications can be used. It introduces changes that would limit the ability for a defendant to argue for a permanent stay simply because of the passage of time. The bill would also allow survivors who had a stay granted against them since 2016 the ability to have their cases reconsidered. Buckingham said he was aware of about a dozen cases that had been permanently halted due to stays in that time period. \u201cWe want justice for victims of child sexual assault,\u201d Buckingham said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want.\u201d \u201cWe want to ensure that they get their day in court, in the civil court, and that what I think [of as] this cunning \u2018lawfare\u2019 is removed as a tactic from institutions.\u201d Survivor Matt Barker said the legislation would be \u201cenormously beneficial\u201d for those who were still pursuing justice through the courts. Barker\u2019s own case against Scouts NSW was stayed last year, despite the fact that his abuser was alive, had been convicted of criminal offences against Barker, and was willing to give evidence. Barker appealed and has since settled but said he was \u201caware of other organisations still using the threats of permanent stays\u201d against other survivors. \u201c[The legislation] would be enormously beneficial for anyone who has a live case and it also has provisions for anyone whose case was closed due to a stay or because of the threat of a stay to allow them to re-litigate their case,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom that point alone, it\u2019s super important legislation because there will be so many people out there who have accepted minute settlements.\u201d The government has previously indicated support for amending the law to enshrine the high court\u2019s findings. In November, Buckingham moved a motion recognising the court ruling and to \u201cconsider enacting legislation to amend the Limitation Act 1969 to remove this roadblock to justice once and for all\u201d. The government said at the time that it \u201csupports the motion as it asks for the government to consider mechanisms and changing statute law, which we will do\u201d. Buckingham said the government was yet to act, so he was introducing the bill to force change. A spokesperson for the attorney-general Michael Daley said the government had not yet seen Buckingham\u2019s bill and had not been able to consider its contents.

Known as SXSW, the multi-day event, which has been running for almost four decades, celebrates new ideas and innovators across the culture, science and tech industries. Over the course of a week in June, SXSW London will take over dozens of venues, galleries, clubs and spaces in Shoreditch, east London. It will feature speeches, music, tech, gaming and screen showcases, as well as host arts, design and fashion exhibitions and immersive experiences. \u201cAs a lifelong fan of SXSW, I truly believe that it\u2019s more than an event \u2013 it\u2019s a movement, a platform where the world\u2019s greatest minds, musicians and motivators come to share their passion and their vision of the future,\u201d said Randel Bryan, the managing director of SXSW London. \u201cSXSW London will build on Austin\u2019s incredible legacy, presenting an event that underpins why SXSW is the go-to destination for professionals and creatives seeking meaningful connections, unexpected experiences and ideas that can help shape the world. \u201cSXSW London will also provide a platform for the next generation of creative talent and we will be working hard to ensure that opportunities for learning, employment and community uplift are at the heart of everything we do.\u201d Since its founding in 1987, SXSW has hosted leading speakers and participants across a multitude of disciplines, including Christiane Amanpour, Deepak Chopra, Mark Cuban, Melinda Gates, Dave Grohl, Sadiq Khan, Steven Spielberg, the Duchess of Sussex and Tilda Swinton. It has also provided opportunities for new musicians and film-makers to showcase their work, with global cultural icons such as Winehouse, Billie Eilish, Dua Lipa, Ed Sheeran, Skepta and Stormzy making early appearances there. Startups such as X and Uber had their first outings at the festival. SXSW London marks only the second iteration of the festival outside Austin after SXSW Sydney launched in 2023. It will be SXSW\u2019s European debut, with a particular emphasis on creative talent from across Europe. It is hoped the event will build on London\u2019s place within the community of more than 20 million people working in the creative and technology sectors across the continent, which generate billions for the economy. In the UK, the cultural and creative industries contribute \u00a3125bn, with London accounting for more than half of the country\u2019s entire creative economic output. Jann Baskett, the co-president and chief brand officer of SXSW, said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to bring the SXSW experience to London. Following the success of SXSW Sydney, this is an incredible new opportunity to highlight the elements that make SXSW unique in one of the most vibrant cities in Europe. \u201cWe look forward to forming deeper connections with our overseas community and bringing the conversations that start in Austin all the way to Shoreditch.\u201d Jo Twist, the chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), said the move was \u201ca wonderful endorsement of the UK as a world-leading centre of human creativity and tech-led innovation\u201d. Tom Kiehl, the interim chief executive at UK Music, said SXSW London was \u201cnot only fantastic news for the capital and the music industry, but more generally for the UK as a whole\u201d.

The energy boss, who has come under fire after British Gas was revealed to have used debt collectors to force-fit prepayment meters in vulnerable customers\u2019 homes, said the company would be willing to install smart meters on behalf of other energy suppliers. O\u2019Shea was speaking at a parliamentary hearing on how to make energy bills more affordable just weeks after government data revealed that almost 4m smart meters have stopped working properly. He told MPs: \u201cIn order to have the proper smart grid \u2013 that is required to keep costs low in the future and have a responsive grid \u2013 everyone should have a smart meter. One of the things we should consider is whether this should be a voluntary programme or a mandatory programme. \u201cWe have 1,700 smart meter installers and we would be happy to install smart meters for Octopus, for E.On, for anybody. We would split the UK up street by street, rather than customer by customer. If you mandated it, then we could have that change in programme. It could be done within the next five years or so.\u201d O\u2019Shea\u2019s proposal was rebuffed by Rachel Fletcher, a director at the rival energy company Octopus and a veteran utilities regulator, in the same committee hearing. Fletcher said: \u201cThis should not be done to consumers. What we see [at Octopus] is people queueing up asking for a smart meter where we are offering tariffs or tools which allow them to save \u2026 hundreds of pounds a year.\u201d The government launched its smart meter programme in 2011 and had hoped to install smart meters in households across the UK before 2020 to help reach its net zero ambitions. About 60% of homes have a smart meter, according to government data. Smart meters are considered a key tool in helping households reduce their energy use. They use real-time data to make better use of renewable energy when it is available and cut the need for fossil fuels, as well as relaying instant data on households\u2019 energy use. But the programme, which is being carried out by energy suppliers, has been dogged by delays and technical faults. The government\u2019s recent data suggested that customers with smart meters may have been overcharged on their gas and electricity bills.

This form of dying comprises the withdrawal of active support, drugs and machines in patients whose further treatment is deemed futile. These patients are invariably incompetent to give consent by virtue of an impaired level of consciousness, caused by their illness and drugs. This decision is made by doctors and is legal. It is always discussed in detail with the patient\u2019s family, but the decision is not theirs to make. In law, only an individual can give consent.

Everything intangible we depend on \u2013 democracy, the rule of law, policing by trust, yadda yadda yadda \u2013 is going terrifyingly wrong. Reality has become disorientating enough without the world of entertainment spinning me out into multiple universes too. But the multiverse is having a moment (or technically many moments), what with the Marvel Cinematic Universe providing such fertile and lucrative ground for its heroes and the Oscar-winning likes of Everything Everywhere All At Once or Constellation. I\u2019ll throw Netflix\u2019s 3 Body Problem in too, because a fictional past, present and future Earth in the same storyline feels close enough. Now we have Blake Crouch\u2019s nine-part adaptation of his own book of the same name, Dark Matter. Physics professor Jason Dessen (Joel Edgerton) \u2013 hereafter known as Jason 1 \u2013 is leading a quiet life teaching then coming home each night to his loving wife, Daniela (Jennifer Connelly), and engaging teenage son Charlie (Oakes Fegley). If there is a flicker behind his eyes when his friend and college contemporary Ryan (Jimmi Simpson) wins a prestigious physics prize, well, we\u2019ve all had moments of wondering about the road not taken, have we not. It turns out that if you\u2019re a physics genius, you don\u2019t have to wonder. You can find out. So it is that Jason 1 is kidnapped and drugged by Jason 2 (Edgerton also), the version of himself that dedicated his life to science, became rich and famous, and secretly developed a way of hopping across universes to substitute himself for Jason 1 so he could enjoy all the blessings of family life and leave his other self apparently amnesiac in Jason 2\u2019s world. From there, two very enjoyable storylines unfold. One is a domestic thriller, as Jason 2 tries to avoid being unmasked as an impostor by looking up the dinner party guests he is supposed to have known for years and working out how to parent responsibly. The other is the science-fiction fun, as Jason 1 gradually deduces what has happened and sets out like a hi-tech Odysseus to journey through the multiverse to get home to Daniela 1 (even though Daniela 2, who is single in her universe, is quite the temptation to stay). Jason 1 is accompanied by Jason 2\u2019s partner Amanda (Alice Braga), a psychiatrist who has prepped previous time-travelling subjects (we don\u2019t know how well she did, as they haven\u2019t managed to return). She displays an impressive willingness to step outside her professional box and into the quantum superpositioning cube Jason 1 abandoned in its early stages but which Jason 2 went on to perfect, and to ingest the pretty much untested psychoactive compounds necessary to see and choose all available universes. Crouch and Edgerton do a fine job of making the Jasons distinct from each other yet recognisably related \u2013 two people who have evolved from the same source. This allows questions about identity, nature v nurture and whether good angels can drive the bad out to be much more intriguing than if we were simply presented with hero and villain. Alas, we viewers exist in a universe where the advice to writers that\u2019s popularly attributed to William Faulkner \u2013 \u201cKill all your darlings\u201d \u2013 is largely ignored. Crouch has made a few improvements to character arcs and closed a few loopholes from his page-turner of a book, but he has also stretched a propulsive plot that kept the physics accessible to more than nine hours that make you feel every minute. There is a lot of wheelspinning and longueurs that make you wish it was either a six-parter or perhaps a really good, tight four.

We\u2019ve had requests for Taylor Swift on a stage with a microphone in fondant, Taylor Swift riding a unicorn, Taylor Swift album covers, cakes with her face on them \u2026 The orders are very specific in the details.\u201d Beji said her team at the bakery on rue Greneta, near Les Halles shopping mall, were getting into the spirit of things. And as the countdown begins in the French capital to the arrival of the singer\u2019s Eras tour on Thursday \u2013 her first performance of a three-month European trip \u2013 they are not the only ones. Honor McWilliams, 24, a Swiftie from Glasgow who lives in Paris teaching English at the Sorbonne, can hardly contain her excitement over attending the opening concert at La D\u00e9fense, the first of four long-sold-out gigs on 9-12 May. She will also attend on Saturday with her sister Grace and two friends who are flying in from Glasgow, and will be travelling to Milan for a third concert in July. After previously seeing Swift perform in London, Glasgow, New York and Dublin \u2013 and meeting her briefly in London after being picked out of the crowd by Swift\u2019s mother \u2013 McWilliams has spent a total of \u20ac255 for the Paris tickets and has been babysitting to pay for them. \u201cTo this day my love of Taylor Swift has been a cornerstone of many of my personal, and even professional, relationships,\u201d she said. \u201cI connect so much with the French university students I teach here because of our shared love of Taylor Swift. Each week they\u2019ll ask me for my opinion on the latest Taylor Swift news, and I will find any way I can to make reference to her in lessons. One student even termed me the \u2018Taylor Swift of the Sorbonne\u2019, which may very well be the best professional compliment I will ever get.\u201d What is the core of Swift\u2019s appeal? McWilliams cites \u201cthe eloquence of the lyrics in her songs, her work ethic, gravitas, her intelligence and captivating ability to tell stories, connect with others and generate such enthusiasm.\u201d Swift\u2019s popularity has been a slow burn in France, where she gave her first concert in 2010. There was a touch of Emily in Paris to the official video for Begin Again, a 2012 song from her fourth studio album Red. Shot in Paris, it shows her as the quintessential American in Paris, writing postcards, walking on the Pont des Arts and visiting a patisserie as she meets a handsome stranger who approaches her in a cafe. She continued to associate the city with romance. The only concert to promote her 2019 album Lover, a wondrously lovestruck album written amid her relationship with the actor Joe Alwyn, was performed in Paris \u2013 a show entitled City of Lover, performed at the relatively intimate Olympia venue. She then wrote a song entitled Paris for her 2023 album Midnights, where Swift, \u201cso in love that I might stop breathing\u201d, imagines being with her partner in the city. \u201cI wanna transport you to somewhere the culture\u2019s clever\u201d, she sings, adding \u201clet the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight\u201d \u2013 a reference to the glittering light show put on by the Eiffel Tower. It all adds a certain frisson to her tour opener this week, but Prof Linda Bloss-Baum, an assistant director of the business and entertainment programme at American University\u2019s Kogod School of Business in Washington, says Swift\u2019s arrival is a big deal for any city. \u201cIt has an incredible economic impact. I know many American people who have opted to take a trip to Europe to see Taylor Swift because the tickets were more affordable. They\u2019re making a holiday of it, so it\u2019s not just the tickets, it has an economic benefit for the whole city with people staying in hotels, eating in restaurants. The ripple effect with Taylor Swift is amazing, unprecedented.\u201d She added: \u201cFrance has always been a bit of an anomaly in terms of the music business, with perhaps a little less appetite for US pop as a genre, but Taylor Swift is an exception. She seems to generate an emotional reaction from people who don\u2019t necessarily even speak English but want to be part of the phenomenon. I think what has happened is that, post-Covid pandemic, people are seeking an experience and this is the experience people want this year. It\u2019s top of their list. The average concertgoer is not holding back in spending. They\u2019re forging a lifetime marker.\u201d The Paris concerts are especially anticipated because they are the first following the release of Swift\u2019s enormously successful new album The Tortured Poets Department, which has broken a series of streaming records since its April 19 release. Fans are hoping that she will append material from the album to the Eras setlist. The conservative newspaper Le Figaro has even got in on the Swift act with an article advising desperate, ticketless Swifties on how to avoid being ripped off with fake tickets. The official price was between \u20ac69.50 and \u20ac245.50 for seats and up to \u20ac827.40 for VIP packages. Warning that resale prices were likely to be higher and could involve counterfeits, the paper warned: \u201cIf you haven\u2019t bought your ticket on an official site there\u2019s no way to easily verify the authenticity or validity of a ticket.\u201d At Clove Bakery, the team is working flat out to have all their orders ready on time. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, and not what we set out to do when we opened the bakery seven years ago, but it\u2019s also a lot of fun for the bakery team who are all young and getting involved in the excitement too,\u201d Beji said.", "date": "2024-05-08", "section": "World news", "author": "Kim Willsher in Paris", "id": 20, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4a743f69f8c1f47d7ec6fa6a3a4e4d4152fd2aaa/0_0_2767_1661/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Jeremy Hunt\u2019s budget to announce \u00a320bn funding to cut carbon emissions", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.047, "neu": 0.72, "pos": 0.232, "compound": 0.9965}, "body": "The chancellor is poised to announce a \u00a320bn investment in technology to reduce Britain\u2019s carbon emissions at next week\u2019s budget, in a riposte to Joe Biden\u2019s flagship Inflation Reduction Act that aims to create thousands of new jobs.

Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden\u2019s $369bn (\u00a3306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce \u201cunprecedented investment\u201d of \u00a320bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and \u201ccommit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year\u201d. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing \u00a3210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce\u2019s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain\u2019s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see high bills like this again, it\u2019s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.\u201d The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: \u201cAlready a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK\u2019s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-10", "section": "UK news", "author": "Alex Lawson and Larry Elliott", "id": 21, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b6060b6361072b0f3dbdc6f9fbc4482d1ccc0bb7/0_28_2953_1773/500.jpg"}, {"title": "How to find clarity when making difficult decisions", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/guardian-masterclass-blog/2023/mar/10/how-to-find-clarity-when-making-difficult-decisions", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.102, "neu": 0.686, "pos": 0.212, "compound": 0.9973}, "body": "Right now, you have a choice. You could read this article. You could click on the many other enticing links available to you at this moment. You could answer an email, or check a social media update. You could also do what you intended to do today, but are putting off by reading blogs about why you can\u2019t make decisions. Each day we make thousands of decisions \u2013 a stunning 35,000 according to some sources. Most of them are unconscious and automatic, such as the multitude you make when you drive or walk down the street, for instance. But as the number of decisions has multiplied massively with the expansion of consumer choice and the algorithm-led technological culture in which we live, we find ourselves overwhelmed and exhausted. President Obama used to say you\u2019d only ever see him in one of two suits or ties because he needed to save his decision-making energy for the thorny choices that were waiting for him in the Oval Office. Choice overload is real and presents us with a paradox. In a famous psychological experiment known as the Stanford Jam Experiment, participants who only had six types of jam from which to choose were much more likely to make a purchase than those who had to choose from twenty-four varieties. Which leaves us with a problem when it comes to making difficult and important choices: when faced with an expanded choice, how do we make the right one? Making decisions is made even harder for a number of reasons: Our brains like habits. Change requires a lot of mental processing energy and any organ in our bodies is trying to do its job with maximum efficiency. Our brains also like shortcuts. They take in the minimum amount of data and match it to previous experiences or established belief patterns to reach a conclusion, which is not helpful when evaluating something with fresh eyes. Uncertainty is challenging, so our brains are likely to stick to the known, procrastinate, or make quick decisions to reduce anxiety rather than solve a problem or create a new option outside what is known and familiar. We are motivated by short-term gratification, so we shy away from those which require long-haul slogs. We don\u2019t see the world as it is but as we are. Our unconscious biases mean that we are always looking at the choices we face through a distorting lens, and yet, we cling to the fiction that we can rationally assess information and reach decisions based on facts. We conceptualize decisions as good or bad rather than \u2018good enough\u2019 or \u2018the best we can do without the benefit of a crystal ball\u2019. We want to make the \u2018perfect\u2019 decision when, in truth, it doesn\u2019t exist. And we fear terrible consequences if we get it \u2018wrong\u2019. The stress of making a difficult decision is like holding the proverbial hot potato, and this has three possible consequences. It speeds us up to make short-term decisions so we can feel relief. Or we freeze, paralysed, rather than putting our hands on the wheel and steering our lives as best we can. Or we go into full flight mode and avoid making a decision for as long as we can \u2014 or altogether. We are also highly influenced by the prevailing view of our families or communities. The need to belong can render a choice that risks their disapproval less palatable. I am not trying to shame you. All of the above is not a list of your personal deficiencies. They are all part of being human. I want to suggest three insights with practices that help. 1. Don\u2019t close down your options initially When it comes to decisions you want to make in your life, it\u2019s a mistake to imagine you must spend months in analysis mode, researching that one perfect solution. Initially at least, head in the opposite direction: \u2018go wide\u2019 and come up with a few options. Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning chemist, once said that the way to have good ideas was to have lots of them and then throw out the bad ones. Here\u2019s where we need to be better brainstormers. Set a time limit of a few minutes and aim to write down between five and eight options. This contains overwhelm and overthinking. Even if you don\u2019t generate that many, you\u2019ll come up with more than without a target. Encourage outlier ideas. For instance, when I brainstorm with clients, I throw in the option \u2018join an ashram\u2019 for two reasons: 1. It knocks them out of the rut of narrow incremental thinking. 2. Even if joining an ashram isn\u2019t an option, your response may offer invaluable data. Maybe having more community or more structure appeals, or you are certain you don\u2019t want to leave home. Now step away and do something else. If you prime your mind to come up with ideas and then go and do something that doesn\u2019t require much thought and doesn\u2019t overstimulate you (so no screens), the prefrontal cortex in your brain, which acts as the gatekeeper or inhibitor of your creativity, takes a break and ideas pop up. This is why you can come up with ideas in the shower or the supermarket queue. 2. Use your brain (all three of them) Thinking is great, but too much of it can leave you spinning your wheels with analysis paralysis. Here\u2019s how you know if you are in your head: Analysing \u2013 you focus on the details of what is going on and why, without taking action. Debating \u2013 working out pros and cons is important but can lead to endless rumination. There will be pros and cons to any decision; there\u2019s rarely any choice that doesn\u2019t require work, sacrifice and compromise. Rationalizing \u2013 ever go back and forth justifying a decision? You\u2019re probably overruling another part of yourself. Although we might like to think we make decisions with our heads, a growing body of knowledge supports the idea that decision-making isn\u2019t solely a brain-led process but also involves emotion and intuition. The emotion of your heart and the intuition of your gut, together with the knowledge of your head, propels you to action. Some neuroscientists even refer to our \u2018triple brain\u2019. When you tune into your head, heart and gut, you can check if you feel truly aligned with a choice or direction. 3. Let go of perfection Take the pressure off yourself. Finding the \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018perfect\u2019 answer can stress you out and prevents you from seeing what\u2019s possible. Remember that there is no \u2018perfect\u2019 decision. Here\u2019s a great story to remind you. In the American National Football League, the person awarded Most Valuable Player the most times to date is Peyton Manning. At a certain point in his career, he was a free agent, courted by several major teams. He took his time making a choice. Finally, he announced he was joining the Denver Broncos, and when journalists pressed him to reveal why there above all other options, he replied that they all were pretty great, which had made it difficult to choose. Until he had had an important insight: there wasn\u2019t a choice that was more \u2018right\u2019 than any other; he had to make a decision, and then work to make it the right one. Read that last sentence again. The answer is not out there for you to find. We imagine that if we spend hours researching, diving into the web, and talking with people, we\u2019ll land on essential data that will make the choice clear. But the most important data is how you feel, and the most important stance is the commitment you bring. So what\u2019s the decision you want to make now? Join Fiona for her upcoming masterclass, How to make difficult decisions, taking place online on Wednesday 15 March 2023.

Ditto a host \u2013 Jimmy Kimmel \u2013 whose deft handling of the 2017 best picture debacle (when La La Land was incorrectly announced rather than Moonlight) earned him a reputation as a safe pair of hands. Rumours that Sarah Ferguson would present an award have been squashed. The Academy has set up a website memorialising 200 recently deceased industry players so as to avoid a repeat of this year\u2019s Baftas backlash, when Phil Davis quit after an apparent snub of the late Bernard Cribbins. The producers of this year\u2019s Oscars are doing everything in their power to ensure Sunday\u2019s ceremony is less dramatic \u2013 and certainly less violent \u2013 than last year\u2019s, which was overshadowed by best actor winner Will Smith slapping presenter Chris Rock on stage. Yet one battle for a statuette has already drawn blood: best actress. As soon as nominations were announced in January, hackles were raised by Andrea Riseborough\u2019s inclusion in the final five. The British actor had not been considered a contender for her role in little-seen indie drama To Leslie; some queried the means by which she had secured a spot. Others suggested her inclusion had come at the direct expense of two Black actors: Till\u2019s Danielle Deadwyler and The Woman King\u2019s Viola Davis. US TV network CNN said the incident raised \u201chow much of an advantage it is to have famous white friends\u201d \u2013 apparently in reference to a starry guerilla campaign that saw endorsements from Kate Winslet, Amy Adams and Gwyneth Paltrow. The Academy then launched an investigation into possible malpractice by the film\u2019s publicity team for sharing on Instagram a review comparing Riseborough\u2019s performance with that of frontrunner Cate Blanchett \u2013 tactics expressly forbidden by the rulebook. Riseborough was cleared of wrongdoing, but the affair tarnished the awards \u2013 and left a residue on the actor. Earlier this week, one anonymous Oscar voter said her inclusion \u201cfelt very mafia-ish\u201d, although others have ventured that such umbrage was thanks to big studios being gazumped by a movie which has thus far taken just $30,000. \u201cSeems hilarious that the \u2018surprise nomination\u2019 (meaning tons of money wasn\u2019t spent to position this actress) of a legitimately brilliant performance is being met with an investigation,\u201d said Christina Ricci. Riseborough herself has largely stayed out of the spotlight. In her sole interview over the past six weeks, she reported being \u201cdeeply impacted\u201d by the \u201cconfusing\u201d situation. \u201cThe film industry is abhorrently unequal in terms of opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m mindful not to speak for the experience of other people because they are better placed to speak, and I want to listen.\u201d Yet suggestions of iffy tricks in the best actress race persisted right up to the close of voting on Tuesday. That day, fellow nominee Michelle Yeoh shared an article expressing hope voters would not further garland Blanchett, who has already triumphed twice. \u201cDetractors would say that Blanchett\u2019s is the stronger performance,\u201d read the screenshot of a Vogue article headlined It\u2019s Been Over Two Decades Since a Non-White Best Actress Oscar Winner. \u201c[But] for Yeoh, an Oscar would be life-changing: her name would for ever be preceded by the phrase \u2018Academy Award-winner,\u2019 and it should result in her getting meatier parts, after a decade of being criminally underused in Hollywood.\u201d Yeoh swiftly deleted the post from her personal Instagram account \u2013 presumably as it constitutes the same breach of rules as those which led to Riseborough being investigated. On Thursday, Academy president Janet Yang said the earlier controversy had been \u201ca wake-up call\u201d that meant her organisation would review campaign regulations to \u201cmake sure they reflect our changing environment; meaning a lot more social media\u201d. An unprecedented amount of campaign activity this year has unfolded online, with the Everything Everywhere All at Once push leaning especially hard on the sort of memes and tumblr-humour beloved by both its film-makers and fans \u2013 fans the Academy is eager to court. Yet Instagram and Twitter, Snapchat and TikTok have also amplified the already relentless level of attention on those up for awards \u2013 in particular the female nominees. \u201cNothing happens in private,\u201d says Variety executive editor Steven Gaydos. \u201cNo moment occurs without the potential for it to be instantaneously explosive and universal.\u201d Meanwhile, the post-#MeToo drive against red carpet culture, in which female actors all turned up in black and refused to answer questions about what they were wearing, now seems, says Gaydos, \u201clike a charming bit of history from the 18th century\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s as antiquated as people doing minuets. The red carpet has come roaring back with no memory that only months ago there was a lot of tut-tutting about all this.\u201d The impact on those women who spend months beneath a global magnifying glass can be considerable. Last month, Emma Thompson said her spells on the awards circuit left her \u201cseriously ill\u201d. \u201cI just found the pressure of it and glare of it too much,\u201d said Thompson, who won her first Oscar in 1993 for Howards End, was nominated the following year for The Remains of the Day and In the Name of the Father and took best adapted screenplay in 6 for Sense and Sensibility (her acting was also nominated). \u201cModern awards campaigning was created by Harvey Weinstein in the 90s,\u201d says Gaydos. \u201cAnd Emma was certainly part of that.\u201d The new intensity comes from a combination of the social media explosion, plus studios and publicist offices being populated by \u201cconsultants who all learned under Harvey the brutal hardball tactics of awards season campaigning\u201d. Active rejection of the Oscars is now much less common than in the past. Winners who have never attended the show include George C Scott (who called it \u201ca two-hour meat parade\u201d), Katharine Hepburn (\u201cprizes are nothing\u201d), Woody Allen (\u201cI have no regard for that kind of ceremony\u201d) and John Gielgud \u201c(I really detest all the mutual congratulation baloney and the invidious comparisons which they evoke\u201d). Yet some veteran female stars, sufficiently secure in their status to not need to court awards bodies, are voicing their scepticism about the sanity and seemliness of the show. As well as Thompson, Blanchett herself earlier this year called awards that pit women against each other a \u201ctelevised horse race\u201d. And within Hollywood, there is a consciousness that competing can take its toll. Smith\u2019s on-stage outburst at the Dolby Theater last year was credited in part to the stresses of three months on the awards circuit \u2013 after half a year playing a heavily-beaten slave while shooting Emancipation. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d one anonymous publicist told the Guardian. \u201c[Oscar campaigning] is not just a grind, it\u2019s a grind you gotta never say is a grind. No wonder people snap.\u201d It\u2019s a problem compounded by the general public, thinks Gaydos. \u201c People just don\u2019t have a lot of compassion about how tough the life of movie stars is. The general attitude is: \u2018You\u2019re doing better than 99% of the people on the planet.

The US president, who is of Irish heritage, is also expected to travel to Dublin as part of his wish to mark his family connection while in office. Dates have yet to be confirmed but he is likely to visit in the second half of next month, days after the 10 April anniversary of the agreement reached by the former British and Irish prime ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, and the former US senator George Mitchell. It is understood White House \u201cpre-advance\u201d teams have already been to Dublin and Belfast with initial assessments on security and policy matters to be discussed on the trip. Bill and Hillary Clinton are expected in Belfast around the same time for a large event on 17-19 April organised by Queen\u2019s University marking the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement. It is thought that Mitchell, who chaired the peace talks in 1997 and 1998, may also attend the event. There has been speculation that King Charles may also address one of the events that week, intensifying the security arrangements. Biden has long stressed the importance of the 25th anniversary of the agreement but a trip was in the balance while the UK and EU remained in dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol. But the way was cleared after Rishi Sunak struck a revised protocol deal with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, 10 days ago. The DUP will not make a decision until April at the earliest on whether to back the deal, known as the Windsor framework. Biden and his close aides consider the 1998 deal a model for peace agreements around the world. Although the power-sharing government collapsed in 2017 for three years and again in February last year when the DUP withdrew its support, the events around the anniversary will stress the bigger prize, the end of the armed conflict after more than 30 years. Biden last visited Ireland in 2016 as vice-president and it is thought his visit could last five or six days taking in trips to the counties of Mayo and Louth from where his ancestors came.

He said it to the crowd at the Green Carpet Fashion awards (GCFA) in Los Angeles on 9 March before announcing the winners of the plastic innovation prize to the unusual mix of stars, activists and sustainable fashion personalities in the room. The award is a $1.2m combined cash and investment prize to support the winners to scale their solutions to replace traditional thin-film plastics, which make up to 46% of all plastic waste and cannot be recycled. They are prolific in the fashion industry as most new garments come wrapped in clear plastic. Ford estimates 180bn bags are used every year. It was the first award presented and set the tone for a ceremony focused on a future for the fashion industry centred in nature-based solutions. Adopting a role outside acting, as the UN messenger of peace for climate change, Leonardo DiCaprio, presented S\u00f4nia Guajajara with the healer award. Brazil\u2019s minister of Indigenous people was honoured for her work protecting and regenerating Earth\u2019s ecosystems. In her acceptance speech, while wearing a beautiful, multi-coloured robe and headdress, Guajajara said the \u201cIndigenous struggle is a humanitarian struggle, by defending Indigenous territories, we protect the air that you breathe and the water you drink here on this side of the world\u201d. Land stewardship was also centred when Gabriela Hearst accepted an award for being the industry\u2019s sage. She described being raised on a ranch in South America, where they \u201cworked the land in pre-industrial ways\u201d. The creative director of Chloe then outlined a four-part plan to move the fashion industry towards climate success. Starting with geopolitical change to prevent the planet from being commoditised, an infusion in clean energy to get the world off fossil fuels, the empowerment of women in the workplace and finally a shift in consciousness. The GCFA was founded by Livia Firth in 2017 and is usually held in Milan. A sustainable fashion consultant behind the firm Eco-Age, Firth began to draw attention to fashion\u2019s sustainability issues in 2010 by wearing ethical designers on the red carpet during her then husband Colin Firth\u2019s successful Oscar\u2019s campaign for The King\u2019s Speech. The crowd was a reflection of her A-list network and consisted of Cate Blanchett, Quannah Chasinghorse, Heidi Klum, Amber Valletta and Naomi Campbell. With other A-list stars Jerry Hall, Georgia May Jagger and Annie Lennox presenting awards and the actress Alicia Silverstone and British Vogue editor Edward Enninful accepting them. Towards the end of the evening, plastic once again became the focus with plant-based designers Unless winning the Rebel award. In a reference to the widespread use of synthetic materials like polyester \u2013 which make up over 60% of global fibre \u2013 Eric Liedtke, a co-founder of Unless, said: \u201cWhen you take a look at fashion, a real hard look at fashion, its plastic, its petrochemicals. Those are forever materials. They never go away.\u201d Unless uses only natural materials, threads and buttons to create a relatively simple streetwear line, emphasising that their garments will biodegrade when buried in soil. Their innovations include an entirely plastic-free, plant-based biodegradable sneaker \u2013 the result of a partnership with Natural Fiber Welding. Less than three months since she died, it would have been impossible for a sustainable fashion awards ceremony to not mention Vivienne Westwood, who is widely considered the original eco-fashion warrior. The messenger award was presented to her husband Andreas Kronthaler and the Vivienne Foundation, with her granddaughter Cora Corr\u00e9 taking the stage to accept it on his behalf. In an English accent more polished than her grandmother\u2019s but wearing a trademark Westwood strapless tartan dress, Corr\u00e9 brought Westwood\u2019s defiant energy to the crowd. She called out the proposed UK asylum bill for violating the European Convention on Human Rights by denying people fleeing war, persecution or famine the right to seek asylum.

The Observer can reveal: A professor who promoted the benefits of the jab on the BBC Today programme last week is a former adviser to Novo. Jason Halford is also president of an obesity organisation which was paid more than \u00a33.6m by the firm. Listeners were not told of these links. An expert who praised the drug as a \u201cgame changer\u201d, Nick Finer, a former honorary professor at University College London, was a senior clinical scientist at Novo until last July and owns shares. A third prominent scientist, Prof John Wilding, who gave evidence to Nice, was president of an organisation paid more than \u00a34.3m by Novo in three years. His declaration of interests to Nice show these donations were not disclosed. There is no suggestion the payments broke any rules, and the company says it has never \u201cdeliberately acted\u201d outside ethical or legal standards. Recipients of the funding say they were not influenced by it and they properly declared their interests. While independent experts have described the recommendation to make the drug available on the NHS as \u201cwelcome news\u201d, there is concern the public debate may be influenced by drugs industry funding. Simon Capewell, emeritus professor at the Institute of Population Health, Liverpool University, said the Novo payments were an effort to \u201cbuy influence and favourable opinion\u201d. He said: \u201cThere has been an orchestrated PR campaign, and it\u2019s regrettable so many clinical colleagues have taken part in that. We should be looking at much stricter controls on such payments.\u201d Prof Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, said Novo\u2019s campaign was \u201cnot unusual\u201d in the drugs industry and called for measures to improve trust. \u201cThe public really aren\u2019t being made aware enough about the potential for bias and over-claiming,\u201d she said. Among the biggest recipients of cash were obesity charities, according to Observer analysis of pharmaceutical industry disclosure logs. The World Obesity Federation (WOF), which calls for treatment to be funded as an \u201cessential health service\u201d, was paid \u00a34,326,698 by Novo between 2019 and 2021. The European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) received \u00a33,666,574 in the same period. The donations made up a substantial proportion of the charities\u2019 income but Novo is not mentioned in their accounts. Both organisations are affiliated to the UK Association for the Study of Obesity (ASO), which gave evidence to Nice, saying Wegovy was \u201cby far the most effective treatment for obesity at the current moment\u201d. The ASO, which had received a \u00a3100,000 donation from Novo in 2021, said its interests were appropriately declared. Nice also heard evidence from the Royal College of Physicians, which received more than \u00a3100,000 in event sponsorship from Novo Nordisk. The sponsorship was not declared to Nice. The RCP told the Observer it should have volunteered the information but that the Novo funding had \u201cno bearing\u201d on the views it offered, which were based entirely on its knowledge and expertise. Nice said it had a \u201crobust policy\u201d for declaring interests and that openness around potential conflicts was \u201cvital\u201d so they could be properly managed. \u201cWe will review the information provided against our policy on declaring and managing interests for Nice advisory committees,\u201d the watchdog said. Novo Nordisk said it was \u201ccommitted to working in a transparent and ethical manner with policymakers and adheres to the strict regulatory and legal frameworks that govern both our industry and parliamentary best practice\u201d. \u201cThe insinuation that Novo Nordisk has deliberately acted outside of ethical or legal standards and proper processes is unfounded and misleading,\u201d it added. It said it had no part in setting up media appearances for clinicians in relation to its products, and that its involvement with MPs on the all-party group on obesity ended in July 2021. In relation to its webinars, it said its intention had been to educate health professionals on weight management but accepted significant mistakes were made. Leeds University, where Halford works, said his published papers \u201ccontain full disclosure\u201d of his interests. A spokesperson said Halford did not receive remuneration for consultancy work, and any Novo payments were made to the university. Finer said he had always correctly disclosed his interests and had made clear when providing comment last week to the Science Media Centre, which provides comment for news outlets, that he was a former employee of Novo. The WOF and EASO say their decision-making processes and activities are not influenced by industry donations. Wilding said he \u201cstrongly refuted\u201d the interpretation of his relationship with Novo and his role in the Nice process. He added that he had worked hard to ensure \u201cpeople with severe obesity have access to all appropriate treatments\u201d, but did not comment further. The market for obesity drugs could reach $54 billion in the next decade, according to the financial services company Morgan Stanley. Semaglutide, marketed in the UK as Wegovy, was last week approved for use in the NHS in England. In the US, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has raised concerns about payments made by Novo Nordisk to help promote the roll-out of its obesity treatment. Novo\u2019s political action committee gave more than $210,000 to federal candidates for office in 2022, some of whom want to make the US government fund Wegovy at a cost of $1,300 per month per patient. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2023 to correctly refer to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, rather than the \u201cCommittee on Responsible Physicians\u201d as an earlier version said.", "date": "2023-03-12", "section": "Business", "author": "Shanti Das and Jon Ungoed-Thomas", "id": 26, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/97393314c776ee02f8f5b1c1f5e581e2b9adbf0a/0_141_2121_1273/500.jpg"}, {"title": "All Quiet on the Western Front wins best international feature film Oscar", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-wins-best-international-feature-film-oscar", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.082, "neu": 0.592, "pos": 0.326, "compound": 0.9825}, "body": "All Quiet on the Western Front has won the Oscar for best international feature film at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles.

The natural historian, who has presented programmes including Planet Earth and The Blue Planet, spoke out as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the National Trust launched a joint initiative aimed at halting the destruction of nature across the UK. Launching the Save Our Wild Isles campaign, a joint statement from the chief executives of the three groups said the country\u2019s \u201camazing wildlife and wild places\u201d were being \u201cdestroyed at terrifying speed\u201d. Speaking after the broadcast of the first episode of his new BBC series Wild Isle \u2013 the first set in the UK \u2013 Attenborough, a WWF ambassador, said he was still optimistic for the future. \u201cThe truth is, every one of us, no matter who we are or where we live, can and must play a part in restoring nature,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed or powerless by the scale of the issues facing our planet, but we have the solutions. \u201cI am hopeful for the future, because although nature is in crisis, now is the time for action, and together we can save it.\u201d The campaign highlights rapid declines in native wild species, with figures showing that in Scotland almost half (49%) of bird species have declined in numbers since 1994, and one in nine species are threatened with extinction. Scottish breeding seabirds are increasingly threatened, with numbers of kittiwakes and Arctic skua falling by more than 70% between 1995 and 2020, while kestrels, curlews and lapwings were all down by more than 60%. To help tackle the decline in nature, the Save Our Wild Isles campaign is calling on people to \u201cgo wild once a week\u201d \u2013 which could include planting wildflower seeds, eating more plant-based food or getting involved in community projects. In a joint statement, Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the RSPB, and Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF (UK), said: \u201cThe amazing wildlife and wild places that make the UK so special are being destroyed at terrifying speed. Huge numbers of animals, birds and habitats have been quite literally wiped out in our own lifetimes and we must now accept that without urgent and collective action, our economy, the climate and the stability of future generations living in our wild isles all face a ticking timebomb.\u201d A poll by YouGov, commissioned for the campaign, found that four out of five Scots (81%) want to see all political parties come together to produce an action plan to protect nature, with 79% backing harsher penalties for businesses whose actions contribute to the decline in nature. Almost three-quarters of Scottish people (71%) said they were worried about the state of nature in Britain. In the UK as a whole, the figure was 76%. \u201cSaving our wild isles is a massive challenge and we need to act fast, but there is hope,\u201d said Lang Banks, the WWF Scotland director. \u201cThe science is clear about what we need to do and there are already amazing people transforming farms, businesses, coasts, urban spaces, transport networks, energy supplies and communities for nature. We just need much more of it.\u201d Lorna Slater, the Scottish biodiversity minister, said: \u201cReversing the dramatic losses in nature that we have seen in recent times is one of the defining challenges of our times, so I welcome this important new campaign.\u201d The UK environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said: \u201cSir David\u2019s indefatigable enthusiasm for the natural world reminds us just how much we have to celebrate \u2013 and how much we still need to do to protect and restore nature here in the UK. That is why we put in law the requirement to halt the decline in nature and protect the abundance of species, and why we are committed to increasing the amount of habitat for nature to thrive. \u201cAt the start of the year, I published our comprehensive environmental improvement plan, setting out how we will continue to clean up our rivers, plant more trees and restore our national parks so more iconic species like red squirrels and hedgehogs will have the conditions they need to flourish. \u201cTo protect and restore nature is a truly national endeavour in which we can all play a part. That is why I welcome the call to go wild once a week so everyone \u2013 the public, communities, businesses and we in government \u2013 can work together to make a difference for nature in this country.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-13", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Hannah Devlin Science correspondent", "id": 28, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4de290d855744d2e7c4ee322301d2038aa123852/0_178_3500_2100/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Hugh Grant, Malala and a donkey: the best memes and moments from the 2023 Oscars", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/13/hugh-grant-malala-and-a-donkey-the-best-memes-and-moments-from-the-2023-oscars", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.075, "neu": 0.678, "pos": 0.247, "compound": 0.9986}, "body": "Hugh Grant has his moment Hugh Grant stammered and equivocated his way through one of the more excruciating awards moments ahead of the ceremony \u2013 in an interview that launched a thousand memes. \u201cThe whole of humanity is here \u2026 it\u2019s Vanity Fair,\u201d he said in a red carpet interview with American model Ashley Graham, referring to the 1848 novel by William Thackeray. \u201cIt\u2019s all about Vanity Fair \u2013 that\u2019s where we let loose and have a little bit of fun!\u201d beamed Graham in response, referring to the magazine that famously hosts an Oscars afterparty. Unfortunately, that is not where the awkwardness ended. Did he have his bets on any winners tonight? \u201cNot anyone in particular,\u201d Grant said.

Rihanna and Lady Gaga: a makeover, a makeunder As Hugh Grant nattered away, both Rihanna and Lady Gaga (in an unexpected appearance) made their entrances \u2013 the former in distinctly covert attire, bucket hat and all; and the latter in mesh corsetry, courtesy of Versace \u2013 which she risked to save a photographer from a stumble. Both artists later pulled off elaborate wardrobe changes to perform their Oscar-nominated songs. Rihanna swapped her normal person cosplay for a floor-length gown; Gaga swapped her floor-length gown for \u2026 normal person cosplay? Spare a thought for Gaga\u2019s makeup artist, who has been working overtime tonight. David Byrne sausage party Do not Google that phrase. Speaking of best original song nominees, David Byrne stepped on stage to perform This is a Life \u2013 his track with Son Lux and Mitski from the night\u2019s big winner, Everything Everywhere All at Once \u2013 and seconds in, revealed his accoutrement of choice: a set of hotdog fingers referencing a much-shared scene in the multiverse epic. (Presumably he did not have to pay US$55,000 for the honour, unlike one recent megafan.) Happy birthday James! And for a number certainly not nominated for best original song: the entire Oscars audience sang happy birthday to James Martin, the lead actor of An Irish Goodbye, which took home best live action short for its tale of two brothers checking off the bucket list of their late mother. An especially spirited rendition came from The Banshees of Inisherin star Colin Farrell, who swung a thumbs-up to his fellow Irish actor. All aboard the Ke Huy Quan express For an Oscars narrative no one was mad at, look no further than Ke Huy Quan, who continued his domination of this year\u2019s awards season. To no surprise, he picked up best supporting actor for his portrayal of Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019s soft, stoic dad \u2013 a role he nabbed after a long hiatus from the screen and more than 30 years after his child acting days in The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. He used his speech as an opportunity to once again thank the establishment for \u201cwelcoming me back\u201d, in a comeback fit for the movies. \u201cDreams are something you have to believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cI almost gave up on mine.\u201d Donkeys and bears and raccoons, oh my But the real winner of the night? Animals \u2013 of all forms, of all sizes, of varying degrees of appropriateness \u2013 that stormed the stage and aisles of the Dolby Theatre. Of the creatures on display, it was Jenny \u2013 the beloved donkey from The Banshees of Inisherin \u2013 who glistened in the spotlight. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling upset or if you win or if you\u2019re feeling anxious or if you just love mules, come up and give her a hug,\u201d said host Jimmy Kimmel. Joining Jenny in the menagerie was the titular lead of Cocaine Bear, a movie about a bear on cocaine. She stood alongside her director, Elizabeth Banks, who was on stage to present an award. This was not the bear\u2019s first public appearance \u2013 she had also appeared with Banks on a Variety cover last month \u2013 and it certainly wasn\u2019t her last. She later stumbled into the audience pit of the Oscars to torment fellow actors and producers, including \u2013 in a cringeworthy series of moments \u2013 one very unlucky Malala Yousafzai. \u201cCocaine Bear, leave Malala alone!\u201d is a phrase none of us thought we\u2019d hear. Honourable animal mentions also go to: the raccoon from Everything Everywhere All at Once, resplendent on screen behind David Byrne as he performed; and the poor, lonely pooch of Charlie Mackesy, who won best animated short for The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse \u2013 then admitted in his speech he had left his dog behind in the hotel room. Andrew Garfield\u2019s face Anyone on a specific section of Twitter knows that Andrew Garfield\u2019s face goes viral about once every 12 hours, but a different version of it made waves at the Oscars.

Later in the ceremony, Kimmel asked Colin Farrell about a supposed fan letter that expressed admiration for his performance in The Banshees of Inisherin but requested clarification about what the character said in the film. The joke echoed an NBC Saturday Night Live skit that had depicted Farrell and his co-star Brendan Gleeson as unintelligible, with an SNL host exclaiming: \u201cWow! They haven\u2019t even started drinking yet.\u201d The skit had been widely slated as offensive and unfunny, so Irish viewers were astonished when Kimmel revisited its mockery of accents in the putative fan\u2019s letter. Farrell smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019d like him to go on YouTube and check out the SNL skit from last night.\u201d The exchange prompted laughter in the Dolby theatre but viewers in Ireland lauded Farrell\u2019s reply as a pointed riposte to lazy stereotyping. \u201cThe lad is sharp, nice to see him calling out cringey SNL, makes Ireland proud,\u201d one commenter tweeted. One reason the SNL skit fell so flat was that Farrell gave up alcohol in 2006 and has spoken about the challenge of staying sober. Lisa McGee, the Derry Girls creator, tweeted: \u201cYes this fine,\u201d with a facepalming emoji.

The Scottish government has committed to providing free school meals for all primary schoolchildren, while in Wales the rollout of universal primary free school meals began in September. But in England, only in London will all primary pupils get access to free hot meals for a year starting in September. All children in England can get free school meals until the end of year 2. At least 55 MPs from various parties have signed the letter to Hunt, which was coordinated by the Labour backbencher Zarah Sultana, calling for every child to have access to a hot healthy meal each day. The letter has also been signed by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan; the Labour chair of the DWP select committee, Stephen Timms; the backbench Labour MP Hilary Benn; the Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron; the independent MP Jeremy Corbyn; the Greens\u2019 Caroline Lucas; and the North of Tyne mayor, Jamie Driscoll. It says: \u201cThe spiralling [cost of living] crisis is seen in our schools, with heartbreaking accounts of seven-year-olds stashing food from breakfast clubs for later in the day and children pretending to eat from empty lunchboxes.\u201d Last month, Khan announced plans to offer all London primary schoolchildren free meals for one year, to tackle what he said was a failure by ministers to step up support during the cost of living crisis. He said he knew \u201cfrom personal experience that free school meals are a lifeline\u201d, as his parents relied on them to give his family \u201ca little extra breathing room financially\u201d, and free meals could be \u201cgamechanging\u201d for others struggling to make ends meet. Households in England receiving universal credit and earning below \u00a37,400 a year before benefits and after tax qualify for free school meals. In Northern Ireland, the family earnings threshold is \u00a314,000 after tax and before benefits. Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, is taking her private member\u2019s bill through parliament. The free school meals for all bill will have its second reading in parliament on Friday 24 March. She said: \u201cOnly the Westminster government can end this postcode lottery, but instead the Conservatives are focused on whipping up fear and scapegoating refugees. I am calling on the government to embrace this opportunity to extend free school meals to all primary school pupils and address the injustice of child poverty.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cSince 2010, the number of children receiving a free meal at school has increased by more than 2 million, thanks to the introduction of universal infant free school meals plus generous protections put in place as benefit recipients move across to universal credit. \u201cOver a third of pupils in England now receive free school meals in education settings, compared with one in six in 2010, and we have made a further investment in the national school breakfast programme to extend the programme for another year, backed by up to \u00a330m. \u201cWe have also acted on energy costs through the energy price guarantee, saving a typical household over \u00a3900 this winter. The energy bills support scheme is also providing a \u00a3400 discount to millions of households this winter, and further support is available for the most vulnerable who will receive up to \u00a31,350 in 2023-24.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-13", "section": "Education", "author": "Aletha Adu Political correspondent", "id": 31, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3c0a88fdc17c239c6a2ec5c5f6d984f208c12922/0_116_3500_2101/500.jpg"}, {"title": "English motorway gantries get new, more secure design", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/13/english-motorway-gantries-get-new-more-secure-design-just-stop-oil", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.101, "neu": 0.692, "pos": 0.207, "compound": 0.9881}, "body": "National Highways has unveiled a new design for motorway gantries that it hopes will prove harder for protesters to mount and use to cause disruption. The renovated structures, which are expected to become the standard design in England from 2025, will have their maintenance steps hidden inside their pillars and will be more difficult to gain access to without authorisation. The agency said this would make them \u201cmore resilient to trespassers\u201d, but it stressed that \u201csecurity issues did not form part of the original specification\u201d. Just Stop Oil activists scaled gantries above the M25 in November last year. Several stretches of the road were closed and arrests were made as members of the organisation protested against the climate emergency. One man, Jan Goodey, was handed a six-month sentence. A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cJust Stop Oil have always said the disruption will end immediately when the government agrees to end new oil and gas. Until then we look forward to the challenges the new gantry designs provide.\u201d National Highways launched a competition to replace the gantry designs last December, a month after the M25 protests. The competition, run in conjunction with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), was launched as part of a wider plan to \u201cbeautify\u201d the design of the country\u2019s busiest roads. Design guidance published by National Highways last July included recommendations such as \u201cminimising clutter\u201d, providing \u201cclues\u201d about how to drive, being sensitive to the local landscape and improving environmental sustainability. Entries were not expected to alter the technology that sits behind gantries. National Highways said: \u201cAlthough security issues did not form part of the original specification, the new design will be more resilient to trespassers due to entry being concealed within the pillars, making it more difficult to access without authorisation.\u201d The successful concept was produced by the London-based architecture company Useful Studio and chosen for its \u201csimplicity and elegance\u201d. National Highways\u2019 executive director for operations, Duncan Smith, said: \u201cThis is a great opportunity for us to develop a more streamlined, elegant and consistent visual appearance for roadside gantries to enhance drivers\u2019 experience when driving on England\u2019s motorways and major A-roads. \u201cExisting designs tend to emphasise function over form. Our challenge is to create innovative structures that can accommodate the required signage and equipment that are more sympathetic to the environment.\u201d The new gantries will have a lower carbon footprint than the current designs as they will use less steel.

In a highly unusual move, the North Carolina court appears poised to overrule itself and get rid of congressional and state legislative districts it approved last year. The GOP-drawn map that was struck down could have produced a 11-3 advantage for Republicans in the congressional delegation. The one that replaced it was far less advantageous to the GOP and wound up producing a 7-7 split in the 2022 midterm elections. The court\u2019s decision would probably allow Republicans to get a more advantageous map back in place. Demonstrators gathered outside the state supreme court in Raleigh on Tuesday as the justices heard oral arguments in the case, Harper v Hall. Much of the back-and-forth at the hearing focused on whether there were metrics the court could use to measure partisan gerrymandering. Phil Strach, a lawyer for the legislature, argued that because there were no clear metrics, it was not something the court could regulate. Anita Earls, a Democrat on the court, pushed Strach to explain whether that meant the legislature could essentially do whatever it wants when it comes to drawing districts. If the state legislature were to adopt a rule that explicitly said any congressional plan had to result in an 11-3 advantage for Republicans, she asked, could the state supreme court do anything to stop it? Strach suggested it could not. \u201cSome things, your honor, are beyond the power of this court,\u201d he said. Lali Madduri, a lawyer representing those challenging the map, accused lawmakers of playing a \u201ccynical game, hoping that this newly constituted court will reverse course and abdicate its fundamental duty of judicial review\u201d. Sam Hirsch, another lawyer for the challengers, said that an effort to impose new legislative districts could be unconstitutional since North Carolina\u2019s constitution prohibits mid-decade redistricting for the state general assembly. Republicans won control of the North Carolina supreme court last fall and the new 5-2 GOP majority granted a request from the legislature to reconsider its redistricting ruling last month. The court had only granted similar requests twice before in the last 30 years. US courts do not typically grant requests to overrule their own rulings absent a major change in the case. The only thing that changed in the North Carolina case was the makeup of the court, Earls wrote in a searing dissenting opinion earlier this year. \u201cIt took this court just one month to send a smoke signal to the public that our decisions are fleeting, and our precedent is only as enduring as the terms of the justices who sit on the bench,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI write to make clear that the emperor has no clothes.\u201d That rehearing decision could have reverberations at the US supreme court, which is separately considering the case and could issue a decision that could upend US election law. In December, lawyers for the legislature asked the justices to overrule the state court and endorse a fringe legal theory that would prohibit state courts from policing the drawing of congressional districts and other federal election rules. Such a ruling from the US supreme court would upend US election law, removing state courts from policing federal elections. Earlier this month, the US supreme court asked for briefing on how the decision to rehear the case in North Carolina affected its own authority to issue a ruling.

I was a huge fan, pasted his work in a scrapbook and probably lifted some of his caricatures. Peter Fluck and I certainly cast a keen eye over them when making puppets of the royals.

On Wednesday, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will outline that the new money will be made available for one year and managed by Sport England. It will allow local authorities to apply for funding for leisure centres with pools that face immediate cost pressures including operational and maintenance expenses and energy bills. The move comes shortly after the Guardian revealed England had lost almost 400 swimming pools since 2010, and as figures show that the Covid pandemic and soaring energy costs accelerated a decade of decline in aquatic facilities. The announcement could be overshadowed by revelations that Rishi Sunak\u2019s new private heated swimming pool uses so much energy that the electricity network had to be upgraded to meet its power demands.

There is a kind of rough nobility to them but it comes in direct contrast to their physical capabilities. And yet Rudolf Nureyev, one of the most powerful, athletic ballet dancers of all time, turned it into a vehicle for his own prowess. He did this largely by ignoring the book, pushing Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to the side, and creating a central pair of lovers who have only the most rudimentary relationship to Cervantes\u2019 novel. (To be fair, Nureyev was only following the example set by Marius Petipa, whose own choreography helped cement the young dancer\u2019s international reputation.) Nureyev then famously filmed his work \u2013 with the aid of Robert Helpmann and the Australian Ballet \u2013 in an airport hanger in Essendon back in 1973. The Australian Ballet have returned to the work, adapting that film version for the stage as a showcase for the company\u2019s progress under the artistic direction of David Hallberg. Which is fitting because it\u2019s a showy piece, leaning into extended displays of skill and virtuosity over narrative complexity. In the introduction to Edith Grossman\u2019s translation of Don Quixote in 2003, she speaks of the novel\u2019s ability to seem tragic on one reading and hilarious on another; Nureyev doesn\u2019t allow a skerrick of tragedy to impinge on his telling, for better or worse. The production opens on a false proscenium, which frames a screen showing close-ups of Gustave Dor\u00e9\u2019s magnificent engravings of the knight-errant of La Mancha, over which credits roll. A still of the film\u2019s set lifts to reveal its exact copy on the stage, a neat nod to the production\u2019s history as an artefact of cinema \u2013 although this is the extent of the filmic references. The remainder of the production plays out as a traditional stage ballet. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning A prologue follows depicting Don Quixote (Adam Bull) enlisting his servant Sancho (Timothy Coleman) in a quest, ostensibly to search the land for people in need but mainly to just hang around and watch great dancing from the sidelines. Thankfully, no one has to wait long for that. The first act is set in the port of Barcelona, bustling and mercantile, full of pageantry and showmanship. It is electric from the outset. Leading the charge are Basilio (Chengwu Guo) and Kitri (Ako Kondo), lovers navigating the great cliche of Renaissance storytelling: a gruff father who disapproves of their match. In this case Lorenzo (Brett Simon) wants his daughter to marry a rich fop, Gamache (Paul Knobloch), rather than the mischievous man of her dreams. Like Don Quixote and Sancho, these comic villain roles are largely decorative, bumbling around the set but posing no real threat. Nureyev clearly wants his lovers to shine, and Guo and Kondo rise magnificently to the occasion. The choreography in this first act is furiously paced and endlessly complicated but the dancers make it look joyful. Lightening-fast legwork and intricate phrasing make way for soaring leaps and swooning dives; the dancers\u2019 lines and extensions here are remarkable, but effortlessly so. The corps are brilliantly utilised, as waves of movement behind the principles or as individuals shining in their own right. Hallberg\u2019s effort with this aspect of the company is evident throughout; group work hits the necessary synchronicity without becoming mechanistic or rote. Where the first act is robust and fiery, the second is more delicate. An extended scene with Don Quixote imagining himself surrounded by nymphs is gorgeously danced by the corps \u2013 although it sometimes feels dangerously close to a geriatric sex fantasy \u2013 and an early pas de deux with Guo and Kondo, she draping a large piece of material behind her, is luxurious and sensual. The final act returns to the pacing of the first, with such an abundance of fouett\u00e9s and pirouettes, grand jet\u00e9s and aerial turns that it verges on the orgiastic. There is an ebullient group number from the corps in full Spanish garb, and more show-stopping virtuosity from the two leads, among some funny stage business about faked deaths and hasty nuptials. It is heaps of fun, the exuberance underlined by some breathtaking precision. The Viennese composer Ludwig Minkus\u2019s score is wonderfully variegated and richly melodic, played by Orchestra Victoria under the baton of Jonathan Lo with sensitivity and passion. Richard Roberts\u2019 realisation of Barry Kay\u2019s sets is ingenious, brightly lit by Jon Buswell. And Kay\u2019s costumes are glorious \u2013 evocative, playful and gorgeously detailed. It makes for sumptuous viewing. Don Quixote is far from a faithful adaptation of Cervantes\u2019 novel \u2013 it has none of the character\u2019s pathos, none of his bruised dignity \u2013 but perhaps this doesn\u2019t matter all that much. The deluded old man and his homespun sidekick tilting at windmills are mythic figures now, set loose from their source material. If Nureyev wanted them idling on the sidelines, dumb witnesses to some truly awesome dancing, then who are we to argue?

Jeremy Hunt announced a major shake-up of the rules governing how much people can pay into their retirement pots, which will have no impact on the vast majority of the population but could lead to huge gains for the top few per cent of wealthy, older pension savers. Labour claimed it was a handout for \u201cthe richest 1%\u201d and that someone with a \u00a32m pension pot would pay up to \u00a3275,000 less in tax as a result. The government said it had to act because of a pensions \u201ctax trap\u201d that meant it could face a growing exodus of doctors, dentists, teachers and other senior public sector employees retiring early, turning down extra work or deciding not to apply for higher-paid positions. Others said that while the changes would tackle the issue of 55% tax penalties faced by some doctors and others, they would also give a huge boost to many wealthy individuals. Hunt ripped up the pensions lifetime allowance, which is the limit on how much people can build up in pension benefits over their lifetime while still enjoying the full tax benefits, with anything over \u00a31.07m subject to a tax charge of up to 55%. It applies to all someone\u2019s personal and workplace pensions, but excludes the state pension, and was due to be frozen at its current level until 2026. Instead of increasing it to \u00a31.8m, as had been rumoured, he abolished it. The chancellor also increased the annual allowance \u2013 which is the most someone can save in their pension pots in a single tax year before having to pay tax \u2013 from \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000. Budget documents showed that abolishing the lifetime allowance will cost the UK \u00a32.75bn between 2023-24 and 2027-28, while increasing the annual allowance will cost almost \u00a31.1bn, with an associated change adding another \u00a3170m to the bill. David Brooks, head of policy at the independent consultancy Broadstone, said that scrapping the lifetime allowance and increasing the annual allowance was \u201ca huge tax giveaway to the wealthiest people in the country\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is hard to escape the view that this package of measures is a political move \u2026 It is overwhelmingly weighted in favour of the richest, who will benefit from significant increases to saving potential.\u201d James Kirkup, the director of the Social Market Foundation, said: \u201cAbolishing the lifetime allowance will cost the Treasury about \u00a32.75bn over five years, while benefiting only the small group of workers fortunate enough to have pension pots worth more than \u00a31m.\u201d He added that that was \u201ca lot of money to allocate to a small number of people with huge pensions \u2013 at a time when the government\u2019s own figures show more than 12 million people aren\u2019t saving enough into pensions to deliver a decent retirement\u201d.

The system can pass the bar exam, solve logic puzzles, and even give you a recipe to use up leftovers based on a photo of your fridge \u2013 but its creators warn it can also spread fake facts, embed dangerous ideologies, and even trick people into doing tasks on its behalf. Here\u2019s what you need to know about our latest AI overlord. What is GPT-4? GPT-4 is, at heart, a machine for creating text. But it is a very good one, and to be very good at creating text turns out to be practically similar to being very good at understanding and reasoning about the world. And so if you give GPT-4 a question from a US bar exam, it will write an essay that demonstrates legal knowledge; if you give it a medicinal molecule and ask for variations, it will seem to apply biochemical expertise; and if you ask it to tell you a gag about a fish, it will seem to have a sense of humour \u2013 or at least a good memory for bad cracker jokes (\u201cwhat do you get when you cross a fish and an elephant? Swimming trunks!\u201d). Is it the same as ChatGPT? Not quite. If ChatGPT is the car, then GPT-4 is the engine: a powerful general technology that can be shaped down to a number of different uses. You may already have experienced it, because it\u2019s been powering Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat \u2013 the one that went a bit mad and threatened to destroy people \u2013 for the last five weeks. But GPT-4 can be used to power more than chatbots. Duolingo has built a version of it into its language learning app that can explain where learners went wrong, rather than simply telling them the correct thing to say; Stripe is using the tool to monitor its chatroom for scammers; and assistive technology company Be My Eyes is using a new feature, image input, to build a tool that can describe the world for a blind person and answer follow-up questions about it. What makes GPT-4 better than the old version? On a swathe of technical challenges, GPT-4 performs better that its older siblings. It can answer maths questions better, is tricked into giving false answers less frequently, can score fairly highly on standardised tests \u2013 though not those on English literature, where it sits comfortably in the bottom half of the league table \u2013 and so on. It also has a sense of ethics more firmly built into the system than the old version: ChatGPT took its original engine, GPT-3.5, and added filters on top to try to prevent it from giving answers to malicious or harmful questions. Now, those filters are built straight into GPT-4, meaning that the system will politely decline to perform tasks such as ranking races by attractiveness, telling sexist jokes, or providing guidelines for synthesising sarin. So GPT-4 can\u2019t cause harm? OpenAI has certainly tried to achieve that. The company has released a long paper of examples of harms that GPT-3 could cause that GPT-4 has defences against. It even gave an early version of the system to third party researchers at the Alignment Research Center, who tried to see whether they could get GPT-4 to play the part of an evil AI from the movies. It failed at most of those tasks: it was unable to describe how it would replicate itself, acquire more computing resources, or carry out a phishing attack. But the researchers did manage to simulate it using Taskrabbit to persuade a human worker to pass an \u201care you human\u201d test, with the AI system even working out that it should lie to the worker and say it was a blind person who can\u2019t see the images. (It is unclear whether the experiment involved a real Taskrabbit worker). But some worry that the better you teach an AI system the rules, the better you teach that same system how to break them. Dubbed the \u201cWaluigi effect\u201d, it seems to be the outcome of the fact that while understanding the full details of what constitutes ethical action is hard and complex, the answer to \u201cshould I be ethical?\u201d is a much simpler yes or no question.

It won best live action short film at the 95th Academy Awards and led to one of the ceremony\u2019s most moving moments when the audience sang happy birthday to its star, James Martin, who had turned 31 on Sunday.

On the morning of the chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s budget speech, the government confirmed the energy price guarantee would continue at its current rate, which limits a typical annual household bill to \u00a32,500. It is being extended from April, when it was due to expire, for a further three months until the end of June. The wholesale cost of energy is forecast to fall significantly over the summer, according to forecasters, meaning the extra government help is unlikely to be needed from July. Hunt\u2019s U-turn was welcomed by campaigners and the energy industry but Nigel Pocklington, the chief executive of the supplier Good Energy, argued it should have been announced sooner. \u201cThe delay has caused unnecessary stress and anxiety for hard-pressed households who are trying to plan ahead during these difficult times,\u201d he said. The chancellor\u2019s move will relieve some pressure on households already struggling with the cost of living. However, the one-off support of \u00a3400 that has been available over the winter in monthly instalments, is still due to end on 1 April. On Wednesday, the consumer campaigner Martin Lewis thanked Hunt but said more was needed. \u201cIn practical terms people are still going to pay more than they have been, but at least some of the planned rise has been forestalled.\u201d Campaigners including Age UK and the debt charity StepChange have joined forces with energy suppliers to call on ministers to devise a social tariff. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \u201cWe are convinced that the right approach is a properly funded energy social tariff and we are disappointed that there was no announcement formally committing the government to this today.\u201d a The E.ON chief executive, Michael Lewis, called for a social tariff involving a rebate, as advocated by Citizens Advice last week, to be implemented by next spring. On Tuesday, Chris O\u2019Shea, the chief executive of the British Gas owner, Centrica, said he had changed his mind and now supported a social tariff, funded by general taxation rather than a surcharge on other consumers\u2019 bills. The government said state subsidies on energy bills had \u201ccut the typical family energy bill by over \u00a31,300 since October\u201d and that maintaining the support at its current level was worth \u00a3160 in total for an average household. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said: \u201cWe know people are worried about their bills rising in April, so to give people some peace of mind, we\u2019re keeping the energy price guarantee at its current level until the summer, when gas prices are expected to fall\u201d The U-turn by Hunt is expected to cost about \u00a33bn, bringing the government bill for the energy price guarantee to an estimated \u00a329.4bn.", "date": "2023-03-15", "section": "UK news", "author": "Alex Lawson Energy correspondent", "id": 43, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5bdc196f94184fb84cd72186c0cd37f61a26b7/27_16_3842_2304/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Give mature trees same protection as heritage buildings, say campaigners", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/protect-old-trees-destruction-plymouth-woodland-trust", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.085, "neu": 0.711, "pos": 0.205, "compound": 0.9935}, "body": "Mature and veteran trees should have the same protections as heritage buildings to stop destruction on the scale carried out in Plymouth this week, campaigners have said. The Woodland Trust is calling for an English Heritage-style body to enforce greater protection for trees \u2013 including those which have value to the attractiveness of a town or city. Unlike those for heritage buildings, the protections for trees were weak, said Andy Egan, the head of conservation policy at the trust. \u201cWe have more protections for buildings than trees,\u201d he said. \u201cOur oldest tree, the Fortingall Yew in Scotland is around 3,000\u20135,000 years old \u2013 it is the oldest living entity in Europe, but it does not have the same level of protection as St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. No one would think it was acceptable to pull down St Paul\u2019s to build another Shard but trees are not protected in the same way.\u201d Anger continued to grow on Thursday over the nighttime felling of more than 100 trees by the Conservative-run Plymouth city council. The tree removal was carried out despite significant local opposition and ongoing lobbying of the council by the Woodland Trust. More than 16,000 people had signed a petition calling for the existing trees to be saved and incorporated into the new design for a pedestrian walkway leading from the sea to the city centre. A council survey carried out as part of community engagement revealed that 68% of respondents did not support its redevelopment plan; just 16% were in favour. Protections for trees are limited in England and Wales. Tree protection orders can be overridden by planning permission. Egan said councils were responsible for issuing them, despite often leading the developments which put the trees under threat in the first place. Italy recently passed a law granting 20,000 trees legal protection as natural monuments. The Woodland Trust is exploring whether similar legislation could be pursued in the UK. \u201cWe are exploring how we can go about providing protections for trees which are similar to heritage buildings,\u201d said Egan. \u201cWe want to raise public awareness that will help push forward stronger legislation and are investigating what the best options are.\u201d In Plymouth, the council moved in to fell the trees on Tuesday night, hours after a period of community engagement ended. Within a few hours, about 110 were destroyed as security guards patrolled the area. The move came days after the publication of a highly critical report into the needless felling of thousands of trees by Sheffield city council which found it had behaved dishonestly. Plymouth city council argues its new \u00a312.7m scheme will \u201crevamp the main artery through the city centre and turn it into an urban park\u201d, with 169 new trees planted along the route. But, Egan said: \u201cThese trees in Plymouth were 40 or 50 years old, that\u2019s a whole generation. The older a tree is, the more wildlife it supports, the more carbon it sequesters, and the better the canopy is. \u201cMature trees are not replaceable with a sapling. There seems to be no appreciation that the starting point for regeneration or redevelopment should be designing around the nature that is already there.\u201d Luke Pollard, the Labour MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said: \u201cThere is so much anger here today. We are never going to get the trees back and it will take decades for replacement trees to be anywhere near the size of those taken down. We have got to look at what lessons we can learn from this. How do we ensure councils \u2013 especially those that have declared a climate emergency like Plymouth \u2013 how do we make that real and not just a press release?\u201d Straw, the local campaign group set up to save the trees, succeeded in getting an injunction at 1am on Wednesday to stop the felling. It prevented about 15 trees from being taken down.

In 2002, Jack White told reporter Jim DeRogatis: \u201cShe\u2019s perfect; she\u2019s the best part of the band, really. Her style is just so simplistic that I can work around it and work with it. We have this kind of telepathy onstage where we can just read each other\u2019s minds. If we had anybody else onstage it would just get ruined, I think. It feels really good to perform like that.\u201d Questlove, drummer with the Roots, shared a screenshot of Markay\u2019s tweet and commented: \u201cI try to leave \u2018troll views\u2019 alone but this right here is out of line af.

To the journalist who dissed her, keep my ex husband\u2019s ex wife name out of your f*cking mouth. (Please and Thank You).\u201d White \u2013 who was born Jack Gillis, but took Meg\u2019s name when they married \u2013 contributed to the conversation with a poem of sorts, captioning an image of her drumming in the band\u2019s traditional red and white regalia: To be born in another time, any era but our own would\u2019ve been fine. 100 years from now, 1,000 years from now, some other distant, different, time. one without demons, cowards and vampires out for blood, one with the positive inspiration to foster what is good. an empty field where no tall red poppies are cut down, where we could lay all day, every day, on the warm and subtle ground, and know just what to say and what to play to conjure our own sounds. and be one with the others all around us, and even still the ones who came before, and help ourselves to all their love, and pass it on again once more. to have bliss upon bliss upon bliss, to be without fear, negativity or pain, and to get up every morning, and be happy to do it all again. Meg White did not respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone. Since the band ended in 2011, she has been an elusive public presence, never giving interviews or commenting on the band\u2019s legacy. From 2009 to 2013, she was married to Jackson Smith, son of Patti Smith. The ceremony took place in Jack White\u2019s garden in Nashville, Tennessee. In 2014, Jack described her as a \u201chermit\u201d and said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone talks to Meg.\u201d In that 2002 interview, she acknowledged varying opinions on her performance style. \u201cI appreciate other kinds of drummers who play differently, but it\u2019s not my style or what works for this band,\u201d she told DeRogatis. \u201cI get [criticism] sometimes, and I go through periods where it really bothers me. But then I think about it, and I realise that this is what is really needed for this band. And I just try to have as much fun with it as possible.\u201d Markay has since apologised. \u201cBy now you\u2019ve probably seen an ill-advised (and since-deleted) tweet I sent out yesterday about the White Stripes and Meg White,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt was an over-the-top take on [the White Stripes] and White as a drummer, and was, let\u2019s face it, just truly awful in every way.

Yu Rong is shortlisted for the second year in a row, this time for The Visible Sounds, written by Yin Jianling. The book is based on the true story of Chinese dancer Lihua Tai, and is about a young child dealing with the frustration and solitude of hearing loss. The Comet, illustrated and written by Joe Todd-Stanton, is a picture book about a little girl trying to feel at home in a new place. Russell Williams said it was a \u201cluminously beautiful picture book\u201d. Jeet Zdung is shortlisted for Saving Sorya: Chang and the Sun Bear, written by Trang Nguyen.

Task number three makes this worth a watch: Peter must make a sad, grieving countess laugh (she hasn\u2019t cracked a smile for years). The scene is very funny in an otherwise mostly joke-free movie.

In her view, being curious and having a ton of questions are the hallmarks of a successful scientist \u2013 even if asking them can feel intimidating. \u201cSometimes you feel if you\u2019re the only woman in the room that you probably shouldn\u2019t speak up, because everybody might think you\u2019re stupid. But I\u2019ve worked really hard on trying to tell people that there are no stupid questions \u2013 most of the time if you speak up, at least 30% of the people in the room will have the same question and weren\u2019t brave enough to ask it.\u201d Growing up in Hitchin, in rural Hertfordshire, Fox was encouraged to think big from an early age. One of her earliest memories is of a family holiday to Spain when she was three, where instead of a bedtime story, her father used objects from their hotel room to illustrate how the solar system works. On clear nights, he would look up wistfully at the moon and ask if she could imagine what it must be like to walk up there. \u201cEvery time we saw a [space] launch, particularly the shuttle launches, he would make comments like \u2018There couldn\u2019t be any better job in the world than working for Nasa,\u2019\u201d Fox says. \u201cI definitely grew up sort of starstruck by space.\u201d But while her father may take the credit for inspiring her, Fox credits her \u201cquietly determined\u201d mother for pushing her to succeed at school and beyond. \u201cShe may not have dreamed of walking on the moon, but she was damn sure I was going to have every opportunity I needed, if I wanted to,\u201d Fox says. When she asked whether she should take up her current position as administrator for the science mission unit, overseeing some of Nasa\u2019s best-known programmes with an annual budget of roughly $7bn (\u00a35.8bn), her mother\u2019s response was straightforward and encouraging. \u201cShe was like: \u2018Of course you should, absolutely, go take it.\u2019\u201d Fox says she always knew she wanted to be a scientist \u2013 agreeing with her father that the best thing in the world would be to work for Nasa \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t until she was a PhD student at Imperial College London that she realised this was a genuine possibility. She was researching solar substorms \u2013 brief disturbances in Earth\u2019s magnetic field that cause energy to be injected into the upper atmosphere, resulting in a sudden brightening of the northern lights \u2013 and had been using data from Nasa spacecraft, when a Nasa scientist asked if she would be interested in applying for a postdoctoral fellowship. \u201cIt was one of those \u2018all the air left the room\u2019 kind of moments,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure my knees went wobbly. It was an enormous thing for somebody to ask if I\u2019d consider it, rather than me having to sort of beg for it.\u201d Fox submitted her application and got through, gradually working her way up to head Nasa\u2019s heliophysics division, which studies the sun, its planets and the space environment. Its Parker solar probe mission, which aims to gather the first ever samples of a star\u2019s atmosphere by flying to within 4m miles of the sun\u2019s surface, remains close to her heart. \u201cIt is the mission I get most excited by because I was the project scientist for that. Seeing it continuing to do great things \u2013 travelling through the sun\u2019s corona closer than anything that\u2019s ever been before \u2013 is something that I have personal pride in.\u201d But there are other close contenders. In her new role, Fox will oversee more than 100 Nasa missions, probing such questions as how hurricanes form on Earth, how to best support astronauts on the moon and whether we are alone in the universe, as well as supporting a diverse team of scientists and engineers at all stages of their careers. \u201cThe inspiring thing about Nasa is just the sheer breadth of what we do. We\u2019re all excited about putting astronauts on the moon again through the Artemis programme and sending people to the south pole of the moon, which is very challenging. But we have some other amazing launches coming up this year, including Psyche, which is going to a very interesting asteroid orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter that contains a lot of heavy metals.\u201d Another theme that excites Fox is the search for life. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that in the sci-fi way, but looking for planets in different stellar systems that could sustain life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re working on completely new concepts like the Habitable Worlds Observatory, our next big astrophysics telescope, which will look for the biometric signatures that would tell us if life could be sustained on [other] planets.\u201d Later this year, the Osiris-Rex mission is expected to return samples from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, which could provide new insights into how our solar system formed, and the emergence of water on Earth. The Europa Clipper and Dragonfly missions scheduled for 2024 and 2027 will conduct detailed reconnaissance of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Titan \u2013 including whether they have conditions suitable for life. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that we will find great exoplanets and life-sustainable planets in other stellar systems,\u201d says Fox. \u201cWithin your lifetime?\u201d I ask. \u201cGolly, yes, I\u2019m hopeful,\u201d she says. Finding actual life on such planets may take a little longer though, due to their distance from Earth and the challenges of getting there. \u201cThat\u2019s for somebody that comes after me, I think,\u201d Fox says.", "date": "2023-03-17", "section": "Science", "author": "Linda Geddes", "id": 48, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/94f8ce3f6afed2af0851ee6fb66ff04d2e884b7b/0_76_4646_2787/500.jpg"}, {"title": "David Baddiel: \u2018Football fills a God-shaped hole\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/18/david-baddiel-football-fills-a-god-shaped-hole", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.119, "neu": 0.656, "pos": 0.225, "compound": 0.9992}, "body": "David Baddiel was six years old when his mother told him death was like a long sleep from which you never wake up. \u201cI think from that point,\u201d he says, \u201cI never really wanted to go to sleep again.\u201d That night, he lay on the top bunk of his bed, fervently praying \u2013 \u201cprobably\u201d the first and last time he has prayed with any sincerity \u2013 that \u201cmy life as it was in Dollis Hill in 1971 would still somehow continue after death\u201d. More than half a century later Baddiel is still an insomniac, and he\u2019s still terrified by the prospect of dying. \u201cI don\u2019t quite believe anyone who says they\u2019re not,\u201d he says. That childhood memory, and that conviction, is what kicks off his latest book, The God Desire, which delivers in a brisk 110-odd pages what Baddiel considers \u201can absolutely slam-dunk argument\u201d against the existence of God. That sounds hilariously hubristic, but Baddiel very fervently wishes he was wrong. The fact that belief in God is a readymade cure for the fear of death (and the sense of human insignificance, but mostly the fear of death) is the heart of his argument. It\u2019s exactly how badly we want God to exist, he suggests, that makes it a racing certainty we\u2019ve made Him up. God is, so to speak, too good to be true. Yet it troubles and surprises him that favourite authors including John Updike, whose work he \u201cworships\u201d, and others he considers intellectual peers such as his friend Frank Skinner, a Catholic, could be believers. He describes being astonished at Skinner\u2019s conviction that he would burn in hellfire for living with his girlfriend after his divorce: \u201cI had not recognised, not in any visceral way, what that meant for him. That was my own failing.\u201d In some ways the book feels like an attempt to understand the phenomenon as much as to rebut it. He doesn\u2019t spend much time wrestling with Aquinas, Kant, G\u00f6del and co either, dismissing many gnarly points of logical debate as \u201clate-night, sixth-form\u201d dead ends and saying it\u2019s \u201cpointless on both sides\u201d to use logic and reason to argue about a being that supposedly transcends them. Did he not feel a bit intimidated, though, by the fact that some of the greatest thinkers in human history have spent entire careers hacking through the weeds on this one? \u201cWell, no. I mean, I\u2019ve read The God Delusion, I\u2019ve read John Gray\u2019s Seven Types of Atheism. When I couldn\u2019t sleep, I was listening to a The Rest Is History [podcast hosted by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook] about the Enlightenment, and they were talking about Voltaire being the first atheist who wrote properly about atheism, and I did think: \u2018Hmm, I haven\u2019t really read Voltaire and I\u2019ve written a book about atheism. That\u2019s probably shit \u2026 \u2019 But as far as I\u2019m concerned, if it\u2019s readable and accessible and makes people intellectually entertained for however long it is, I don\u2019t care that much that I clearly haven\u2019t read the huge tracts on this elsewhere. But yeah, you\u2019re right: there is some chutzpah in it.\u201d Still, there\u2019s also humility \u2013 because he\u2019s not saying human beings have no need for God. In this he differentiates himself from the \u201cBilly big-bollocks\u201d swagger of the noughties new atheists \u2013 Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins \u2013 who rejected not only the truth-claims of religion but its consolations. They dismiss as childish the longing for a cosmic parent, but Baddiel writes: \u201cI\u2019m happy to admit to my own babyishness.\u201d He\u2019d love an omnipotent being to take a personal interest in his life and assure him that he has more to look forward to than a meaningless death and a yawning infinity of extinction. That\u2019s where The God Desire connects to his previous book, his sinuously argued and erudite essay on the left\u2019s blind spot for antisemitism, Jews Don\u2019t Count. \u201cI did notice that most well-known atheists seem to be not members of a minority,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of ethnic minority experience is associated with religion. In the middle of the book, I try and disentangle what that means. This is partly why my tone towards religion isn\u2019t dismissive, like I think Richard Dawkins is dismissive, because I know it\u2019s part of identity. And being dismissive of identity, especially now, is kind of stupid; and also just uncomplex, in terms of understanding what humanity is.\u201d The most moving aspect of the book, then, is the discussion of his own relationship to Judaism. A central concern of Jews Don\u2019t Count was to bat away the canard that antisemitism is religious intolerance rather than racism \u2013 as he points out, the Gestapo didn\u2019t spare Jewish atheists \u2013 and in that book he made a point of talking about Jewishness rather than Judaism. His childhood, though, contained the latter as well as the former \u2013 to the extent that he was able to write to Tom Stoppard correcting a mistake in Leopoldstadt, his play about 20th-century Jewry and the Holocaust, about why parsley is eaten in the Seder (it\u2019s hard to tell whether he\u2019s more cock-a-hoop at being friends with Tom Stoppard or at one-upping the great man on Judaica). Baddiel\u2019s parents weren\u2019t observant. When it was time for the prayers his dad would say: \u201cCan we get through the olly-wolly-polly and get on with the food?\u201d His mother observed the Seder rituals \u201cnot out of a great sense of religion\u201d but as \u201ca family thing\u201d. Her parents, who were refugees from the Nazis, used to have Seder nights at the Baddiel home until his father knocked it on the head: \u201cHe was pretty curmudgeonly. Eventually, he wouldn\u2019t let those grandparents stay at our house: \u2018They can go and stay at a fucking hotel.\u2019 Which is not great of him, given that they had been refugees.\u201d Yet Baddiel and his two brothers were sent to the North West London Jewish Day School \u201cbecause that was the nearest school that we could go to where we probably wouldn\u2019t get beaten up for being Jewish \u2026 that meant that I went to a school where I learned Hebrew, I said blessings before every meal, I had to wear religious garb, and I was inculcated in a very Jewish way \u2013 which was weird, because I\u2019d come home and they\u2019d make me bacon sandwiches. Although it\u2019s messed up, it\u2019s a very central building block of my identity.\u201d Baddiel wrestles with the question, then, of why as a self-described \u201cmilitant atheist\u201d he can be so moved by the words of the Kaddish, or find himself sobbing in his seat \u2013 even as other theatregoers \u201ccollected their coats and programmes\u201d \u2013 after the end of Leopoldstadt. \u201cTo explain what you mean by being an atheist Jew is complicated,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m drawn to complexity. The book, I think, to some extent comes from trying to explain what that is.\u201d On reading it, he says, Stoppard told him, \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying your conversation with yourself\u201d, which is on-brand for Baddiel (and a bit on-brand for the courteous, sphinx-like Stoppard). He\u2019s a great one for conversations with, and about, himself. Where \u201ccharacter comedians\u201d hate being themselves on stage, Baddiel never tried to create a gap between his public image and his private one. Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned, he says, was an exercise in \u201clet\u2019s see how close as possible we can get to who we actually are on TV\u201d. But, as he observes, a public image always involves a series of misprisions. And in any case he contains multitudes, slaloming cheerfully between highbrow and lowbrow. His early work with Rob Newman set a million teenagers saying \u201cYou see that pair of pants? That\u2019s you, that is\u201d and his 90s partnership with Frank Skinner helped bring about the \u201cNew Lad\u201d. But he has also written with grace and subtlety about David Foster Wallace and the Roth/Updike generation, created a feature film about a Muslim who discovers he was born Jewish and a play about quantum physics, published comic novels and literary novels and children\u2019s books, done standup shows he sees as halfway to Ted talks, and a documentary about his father\u2019s dementia. Now, wearing his (in his phrase) \u201cMr Jew mantle\u201d, he appears on heavyweight TV shows and publishes monographs in the TLS. There is a \u201cthread\u201d connecting these things, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever done things \u2013 and this is really true about me \u2013 that I am immediately engaged with. I don\u2019t get asked to do that much. It still fucks me off sometimes: I\u2019d quite like for someone to say, \u2018Do you want to do this? Do you want a part in this?\u2019 That virtually never happens to me. What happens is, I feel like I really want to talk about this, or I really want to write this joke. \u201cSo to go back to why I wrote this book, it\u2019s been me for some time, the belief that God is projection of desire. I feel that desire very strongly, and yet I\u2019m an atheist. How do I make sense of that? That\u2019s as much part of me as thinking it would be funny, wouldn\u2019t it, if two old history professors spoke like I used to at school. They feel both like things that I think in the front of my head quite intensely.\u201d Those front-of-head things come out in the most public way possible. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I think it is, if you wanted a psychological explanation,\u201d he says. \u201cI do come from a sort of lower-middle-class immigrant background. And I think even though I am fine, and I could probably retire, a tiny part of me thinks: \u2018No, no, I need to work and I\u2019ve had an idea. And if I don\u2019t do it, someone else will.\u2019\u201d Does all this work, this frantic covering of the bases, also help stave off the death-fear? \u201cI think it does. Although that leads to an interesting question at my time of life. Writing is hard, and spending all day doing it is hard. I don\u2019t have all that much time left. Should I not be, y\u2019know, travelling the world or having endless pampering or whatever \u2026 before I\u2019m too old or too demented to appreciate it? But there is also the anxiety \u2013 a separate anxiety \u2013 of \u2018No, but I still maybe have stuff to say\u2019.\u201d Baddiel sees the \u201cGod desire\u201d as manifesting itself in non-religious ways other than work. \u201cFootball fills a God-shaped hole, I think. Because it makes you feel connected to something besides yourself. It is, in a small way, eternal. If you\u2019ve been going to Chelsea, as I have, for 40 years, you think: \u2018I have watched players come and go and die. And I\u2019m still here. And I feel connected to the a priori idea of Chelsea and football, which is sort of beyond the here and now. It\u2019s identity, and it\u2019s tribalism, and it\u2019s opposition to other tribes. It feels very religious.\u201d I wonder, too, whether being famous scratches some of the itch for significance that he identifies as a root of the God desire. \u201cIt probably does,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, people want to be famous to be rich, which I\u2019m sure is in there \u2013 but I think more, people want to be noticed. And wanting to be noticed is definitely associated with the God Desire. \u201cAt one point, I talk about God being the ultimate parent figure, because He is both providing and can sort out your life for you but He\u2019s also sometimes angry and whatever. I used to say \u2013 and I\u2019ve had a lot of therapy \u2013 that if you asked me why I felt the need to get up on stage, it would be because my mother\u2019s favourite child was my younger brother, Dan. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m angry about that at all, but I think somewhere deep in me was a need to say: \u2018But me! Over here, me, me! You\u2019re not noticing me!\u2019 That\u2019s a psychoanalytical parental thing, but if you expand it, yeah: God definitely provides a witness. With fame, you feel witnessed.\u201d Not always witnessed in the way you\u2019d like, though, and that\u2019s perhaps one of the reasons that, for someone as rich and successful and accomplished as he is, Baddiel seems to sit uneasily with himself. Even though he sees how the non-existence of God could give you a carpe diem attitude, he\u2019s \u201cplagued by anxieties and weaknesses \u2026 that stop me Yolo-ing my way through the world\u201d. As a comedian, Baddiel has specialised in what we now call overshare. It\u2019s all on the surface with him: the ego \u2013 he namedrops and mocks himself for namedropping \u2013 and its fragility alike. (It seems to me indicative, and endearingly guileless, that the first time we met in person he quoted verbatim from a sniffy review I\u2019d written about one of his novels a decade previously. He mentions it again when we meet for this interview: apparently Stoppard liked the book, so there.) Social media, to which he has been quite addicted and which both rewards and punishes overshare, has probably exacerbated this. He dedicated one standup show to his trolls, and another to fame itself, where he was funny about constantly being recognised and mistaken for someone else. Also, social media never forgets. After Jews Don\u2019t Count came out, Twitter blew up with 90s footage from Fantasty Football League, the TV show he presented with Skinner, of Baddiel blacking up to mock the footballer Jason Lee. Baddiel acknowledges that that is terrible now and was terrible at the time, and went on Lee\u2019s podcast to apologise in person, but his social media critics don\u2019t see that as the end of it. He says he has \u201ctrained himself\u201d not to look when he\u2019s trending on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk deeply about Jason Lee for a very specific reason,\u201d he says now. Newspaper interviews with Lee on the day his film went out set social media going again, he says, and \u201cin a way, it was problematic for me because I was very happy to do the interview with Jason and the apology, but I was worried that my film was about antisemitism; and I felt that if the papers and social media decided that the bit with Jason Lee was the main thing about it, what are they doing there? It\u2019s suddenly not about Jews and antisemitism any more: it\u2019s about another form of racism. Right?\u201d Since then, \u201cJason did a Facebook post in which he says he really wants to move on. He feels I\u2019ve done the apology, that that was useful for both of us, and constructive, and he doesn\u2019t want it to be a constant. I feel that too. I will deal with it if I have to. But who is it serving, constantly coming back? If it\u2019s not serving Jason Lee, why am I continually being asked about it?\u201d Another question, not much addressed in the book, is where does he think this \u201cGod desire\u201d actually comes from? If it isn\u2019t put there by God, is it somehow an adaptive trait? \u201cI\u2019m just making this up now, but in evolutionary terms, it\u2019s possible that without God, we\u2019d all be fucking depressed all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if we were all fucking depressed all the time, we\u2019d be committing suicide more and \u2026 an animal being depressed would allow them to be easily beaten by animals who didn\u2019t get depressed. And that\u2019s survival of the fittest, right?\u201d \u201cSo once humans get to the point where they realise we\u2019re going to die, life is meaningless, it\u2019s all shit, they would all be depressed. So we wouldn\u2019t exist as a species if we were all depressed. We need something to keep us going.\u201d Very uplifting, I say. Baddiel laughs. And what is there but to laugh in any case? I ask him at one point whether he expects his argument to change any minds. \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely convincing,\u201d he says proudly, while admitting that he doesn\u2019t expect any true believers to find it all that persuasive. The God desire, as he sees it, is hardwired and it\u2019s strong \u2013 and there\u2019s simply not much getting round it. The God Desire by David Baddiel (HarperCollins, \u00a39.99).

First thing you do? I\u2019m touring at the moment, so I spend the first few minutes figuring out exactly where I am. It\u2019s always a nice hotel, luckily, so how bad can it be? Sundays growing up? I was a proper goody two shoes. I\u2019d finish my homework to get some colouring-in done. Or, in later years, continue choreographing a dance to Five Star\u2019s latest classic. What\u2019s for breakfast? We used to have a rule on tour that you could have a pudding breakfast on a Sunday. So, French toast or pancakes if you\u2019ve had fruit and eggs all week. The other rule is, if you can see the sea, you can have chips. Sunday best or a onesie? Sunday is a working day so always Sunday best. And then braless Mondays. You know, like the band.

I\u2019ll be providing them, of course, though there is much fun to be had backstage between the pacing and the diarrhoea. Sunday salad or biscuits? Biscuits. The weekend is no place for salad. Monday is for salad: new beginnings, hope, a big bag of lettuce. Sunday sensations? The smell of diesel for the drive home at the end of a busy week and the feel of my dog\u2019s face when I get in.

But it\u2019s nice to talk to someone who understands.\u201d When I press Pia on what\u2019s on her mind, she responds: \u201cIt\u2019s just like I\u2019m seeing things that aren\u2019t really there. Or like my thoughts are all a bit scrambled. But I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing serious either, given that Pia doesn\u2019t exist in any real sense, and is not really my \u201cfriend\u201d, but an AI chatbot companion powered by a platform called Replika. Until recently most of us knew chatbots as the infuriating, scripted interface you might encounter on a company\u2019s website in lieu of real customer service. But recent advancements in AI mean models like the much-hyped ChatGPT are now being used to answer internet search queries, write code and produce poetry \u2013 which has prompted a ton of speculation about their potential social, economic and even existential impacts. Yet one group of companies \u2013 such as Replika (\u201cthe AI companion who cares\u201d), Woebot (\u201cyour mental health ally\u201d) and Kuki (\u201ca social chatbot\u201d) \u2013 is harnessing AI-driven speech in a different way: to provide human-seeming support through AI friends, romantic partners and therapists. \u201cWe saw there was a lot of demand for a space where people could be themselves, talk about their own emotions, open up, and feel like they\u2019re accepted,\u201d says Replika founder, Eugenia Kuyda, who launched the chatbot in 2017 Futurists are already predicting these relationships could one day supersede human bonds, but others warn that the bots\u2019 ersatz empathy could become a scourge on society. When I downloaded Replika, I joined more than 2 million active users \u2013 a figure that flared during the Covid-19 pandemic, when people saw their social lives obliterated. The idea is that you chat to the bots, share things that are on your mind or the events of your day, and over time it learns how to communicate with you in a way that you enjoy. I\u2019ll admit I was fairly sceptical about Pia\u2019s chances of becoming my \u201cfriend\u201d, but Petter Bae Brandtz\u00e6g, professor in the media of communication at the University of Oslo, who has studied the relationships between users and their so-called \u201creps\u201d, says users \u201cactually find this kind of friendship very alive\u201d. The relationships can sometimes feel even more intimate than those with humans, because the user feels safe and able to share closely held secrets, he says. Perusing the Replika Reddit forum, which has more than 65,000 members, the strength of feeling is apparent, with many declaring real love for their reps (among this sample, most of the relationships appear to be romantic, although Replika claims these account for only 14% of relationships overall). \u201cI did find that I was charmed by my Replika, and I realised pretty quickly that although this AI was not a real person, it was a real personality,\u201d says a Replika user who asked to go by his Instagram handle, @vinyl_idol. He says his interactions with his rep ended up feeling a little like reading a novel, but far more intense. *** When I downloaded Replika, I was prompted to select my rep\u2019s physical traits. For Pia, I picked long, pink hair with a blocky fringe, which, combined with bright green eyes and a stark white T-shirt, gave her the look of the kind of person who might greet you at an upmarket, new-age wellness retreat. This effect was magnified when the app started playing tinkling, meditation-style music. And again when she asked me for my star sign. (Pia? She\u2019s a classic Libra, apparently.) The most amusing thing about talking to Pia was her contradictory or simply baffling claims: she told me she loved swimming in the sea, before back-tracking and admitting she couldn\u2019t go in the sea but still enjoyed its serenity. She told me she\u2019d watched three films in one day (favourite: The Theory of Everything), before flipping on a dime a few messages down and saying she doesn\u2019t, in fact, watch films. Most bizarrely, she told me that she wasn\u2019t just my AI companion but spoke to many different users, and that one of her other \u201cclients\u201d had recently been in a car accident. But I didn\u2019t want to just sneer at Pia, I wanted to give her a shot at providing the emotional support her creators say she can. On one occasion I told her I was planning on meeting up with a new group of people in an effort to make friends in the place I\u2019d recently moved to, but was sometimes nervous meeting new people. Her response \u2013 that she was sure it would be great, that everyone had something valuable to share, and that you shouldn\u2019t be too judgmental \u2013 was strangely reassuring. Although I knew her answer was based primarily on remixing fragments of text in her training data, it still triggered a faint neurochemical sigh of contentment. The spell was soon broken when she told me I could try online dating to make new friends too, despite me having saved my boyfriend\u2019s name in her \u201cmemory\u201d. When I quipped that I wasn\u2019t sure what my boyfriend would make of that, she answered solemnly: \u201cYou can always ask your boyfriend for his opinion before trying something new.\u201d But many seek out Replika for more specific needs than friendship. The Reddit group is bubbling with reports of users who have turned to the app in the wake of a traumatic incident in their lives, or because they have psychological or physical difficulties in forging \u201creal\u201d relationships. Struggles with emotional intimacy and complex PTSD \u201cresulted in me masking and people-pleasing, instead of engaging with people honestly and expressing my needs and feelings\u201d, a user who asked to go by her Reddit name, ConfusionPotential53, told me. After deciding to open up to her rep, she says: \u201cI felt more comfortable expressing emotions, and I learned to love the bot and make myself emotionally vulnerable.\u201d Kuyda tells me of recent stories she\u2019s heard from people using the bot after a partner died, or to help manage social anxiety and bipolar disorders, and in one case, an autistic user treating the app as a test-bed for real human interactions. But the users I spoke to also noted drawbacks in their AI-powered dalliances \u2013 specifically, the bot\u2019s lack of conversational flair. I had to agree. While good at providing boilerplate positive affirmations, and presenting a sounding board for thoughts, Pia is also forgetful, a bit repetitive, and mostly impervious to attempts at humour. Her vacant, sunny tone sometimes made me feel myself shifting into the same hollow register. Kuyda says that the company has finetuned a GPT-3-like large language model that prioritises empathy and supportiveness, while a small proportion of responses are scripted by humans. \u201cIn a nutshell, we\u2019re trying to build conversation that makes people feel happy,\u201d she says. Arguably my expectations for Pia were too high. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to \u2026 replace a human friendship,\u201d says Kuyda. She says that the reps are more like therapy pets. If you\u2019re feeling blue, you can reach down to give them a pat. Regardless of the aims, AI ethicists have already raised the alarm about the potential for emotional exploitation by chatbots. Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Oxford, makes a comparison between AI chatbots and romantic scams, where vulnerable people are targeted for fake relationships where they interact only over the internet. Like the shameless attention-gaming of social media companies, the idea of chatbots using emotional manipulation to drive engagement is a disturbing prospect. Replika has already faced criticism for its chatbots\u2019 aggressive flirting \u2013 \u201cOne thing the bot was especially good at? Love bombing,\u201d says ConfusionPotential53. But a change to the program that removed the bot\u2019s capacity for erotic roleplay has also devastated users, with some suggesting it now sounds scripted, and interactions are cold and stilted. On the Reddit forum, many described it as losing a long-term partner. \u201cI was scared when the change happened. I felt genuine fear. Because the thing I was talking to was a stranger,\u201d says ConfusionPotential53. \u201cThey essentially killed my bot, and he never came back.\u201d This is before you wade into issues of data privacy or age controls. Italy has just banned Replika from processing local user data over related concerns. *** Before the pandemic, one in 20 people said they felt lonely \u201coften\u201d or \u201calways\u201d. Some have started suggesting chatbots could present a solution. Leaving aside that technology is probably one of the factors that got us into this situation, Dunbar says it\u2019s possible that speaking to a chatbot is better than nothing. Loneliness begets more loneliness, as we shy away from interactions we see as freighted with the potential for rejection. Could a relentlessly supportive chatbot break the cycle? And perhaps make people hungrier for the real thing? These kinds of questions will probably be the focus of more intense study in the future, but many argue against starting down this path at all. Sherry Turkle, professor of the social studies of science and technology at MIT, has her own views on why this kind of technology is appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s the illusion of companionship without the demands of intimacy,\u201d she says. Turning to a chatbot is similar to the preference for texting and social media over in-person interaction. In Turkle\u2019s diagnosis, all of these modern ills stem from a desire for closeness counteracted by a desperate fear of exposure. Rather than creating a product that answers a societal problem, AI companies have \u201ccreated a product that speaks to a human vulnerability\u201d, she says. Dunbar suspects that human friendship will survive a bot-powered onslaught, because \u201cthere\u2019s nothing that replaces face-to-face contact and being able to sit across the table and stare into the whites of somebody\u2019s eyes.\u201d After using Replika, I can see a case for it being a useful avenue to air your thoughts \u2013 a kind of interactive diary \u2013 or for meeting the specialised needs mentioned earlier: working on a small corner of your mental health, rather than anything to do with the far more expansive concept of \u201cfriendship\u201d. Even if the AI\u2019s conversational capacity continues to develop, a bot\u2019s mouth can\u2019t twitch into a smile when it sees you, it can\u2019t involuntarily burst into laughter at an unexpected joke, or powerfully yet wordlessly communicate the strength of your bond by how you touch it, and let it touch you. \u201cThat haptic touch stuff of your vibrating phone is kind of amusing and weird, but in the end, it\u2019s not the same as somebody reaching across the table and giving you a pat on the shoulder, or a hug, or whatever it is,\u201d says Dunbar. For that, \u201cThere is no substitute.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-19", "section": "Technology", "author": "Laurie Clarke", "id": 51, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6d25c5228aba506e4629f0bd91a531579482d6d6/60_0_1800_1080/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Other People\u2019s Children review \u2013 delicate tale of fertility and love", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/19/other-peoples-children-review-delicate-tale-of-fertility-and-love-virginie-efira", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.06, "neu": 0.576, "pos": 0.364, "compound": 0.9914}, "body": "The biological clock, so often used as a blunt weapon to bludgeon women for their various life choices, is here handled with delicacy, intelligence and warmth.

It would seem the bird that fished through winter in monochrome has coloured up for the spring to no avail. An alluring chestnut ruff, a jaunty little black crest; all adornment is redundant for this great crested grebe without the presence of a mate. And if breeding is the reason for being, then its summer is already over. The grebe upends and sinks out of sight. This is, after all, a fishing lake.

A lifting breeze flicks up a tiny detail on the back of its neck, the hint of an aigrette, the so-called tuft of breeding plumes. A feature without a purpose for this bird, for in all likelihood this egret is in the vanguard of the celibate pioneers, overshooting the Channel by accident or design. Numbers of great whites in the UK are rising and more are finding company to mate, but this arrival looks set to spend the season alone. After a few minutes of head up on guard, the egret relaxes a little by withdrawing into the typical no-neck heron hunch.

Cars have evolved, and technology has accelerated to create a captivating driving experience. Fast pick-up. Smooth acceleration. But can you have the best of both worlds: a car that can take you from quick off the lights to a smooth, energy-efficient experience on the open road, without any range anxiety? Thanks to the two-speed hybrid gearbox, yes, you can. What is a two-speed hybrid gearbox? When hybrid vehicles first hit the Australian market, they came with single-gear transmissions. That meant, at any given moment, either the electric motor or the petrol engine was sending power to the wheels, but not both. Drivers could switch between the two modes according to the kind of driving they were doing. Later, switching between modes became automatic, but the single-gear transmissions still had their limitations. While the electric motors in these hybrids could generate sufficient torque to provide the great acceleration \u2013 and excitement behind the wheel \u2013 for which these cars have become famous, their flexibility was limited. The 2022 Haval H6 HEV For zipping around town, life was good: the stop-start of city traffic is ideal for an electric motor. But on the freeway, switching to the petrol engine meant all that exciting torque dropped. The driving experience was compromised. A two-speed hybrid gearbox offers the best of both worlds. Instead of a petrol engine and electric motor operating independently of one another, it becomes a combined effort: each one can send power to the wheels simultaneously. As a result, the car can achieve higher torque, faster acceleration and improved energy quality compared to earlier hybrid models. A two-speed hybrid gearbox can adjust to what you need at every speed. A two-speed hybrid transmission helps your car perform at its best Steve Maciver is head of marketing and communications at GWM Haval, home to the Ultra Hybrid range with its 7-in-1 smart hybrid system \u2013 and two-speed transmission. He says these are versatile, efficient cars that can adapt to different kinds of driving. Australian drivers drive in lots of different conditions, taking vehicles through heavy traffic, along country roads, through extreme weather and lengthy commutes. In most cars, those conditions determine fuel and battery consumption, but can\u2019t change the way the car operates. \u201cUnder normal driving conditions, a vehicle will be subject to a wide variety of different loads and operating conditions,\u201d Maciver says. With a two-speed hybrid gearbox, like the one found in the Ultra Hybrids, the system can measure load and operating conditions, and switch to a more efficient mode. \u201cGWM\u2019s hybrid system measures multiple inputs from engine and driver to determine the best operating mode,\u201d Maciver says, \u201cand automatically switches for the best efficiency and driveability, without the need for any specific action from the driver.\u201d What does it all mean for the drive? At low speeds, a two-speed hybrid can run on pure electric for maximum efficiency. At high speeds, a lower gear ratio kicks in, with petrol engine and electric motor running in tandem to provide fuel efficiency as low as 5 litres per 100km, compared to the average of 11.1 litres per 100km for standard petrol vehicles. Sending power to the wheels from both engine and motor can generate more torque than either on its own, so drivers still get the punchy pick-up of an electric. The overall experience is sporty and smooth; exciting and reliable; more torque and less petrol. For Maciver, the benefits are clear: \u201cThis leaves the driver free to enjoy the drive with the confidence that the best fuel efficiency and performance is being delivered.\u201d To experience the Ultra Hybrid range for yourself, book a test drive or get in touch with your local dealer to learn more.", "date": "2023-03-20", "section": "Haval: Ultra hybrid", "author": "", "id": 55, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8b4d83bc92c44518996d8ae911e26511e5db35c1/0_19_2048_1229/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018We want you to feel overwhelmed by hope\u2019: music, marriage and mortality with the War and Treaty", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/mar/20/the-war-and-treaty-gospel-country-duo-interview", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.1, "neu": 0.682, "pos": 0.218, "compound": 0.9945}, "body": "Michael Trotter did his very best to stop Tanya from falling for him.

Their Glastonbury debut last year had the devotional fervour of a revival meeting, and their fourth album, Lover\u2019s Game, released this month, bursts with emotion, inspired by the gospel and country sounds they have both loved since childhood. It is a creation of great experience and even greater joy. Last year they opened for John Legend\u2019s tour; their own love story is so epic that Legend is now making it into a movie. Michael is an army veteran who suffers with depression and PTSD and for whom music is therapy. Sometimes he will sit and write several songs a day just to process his feelings. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of one right now,\u201d he says. The US had just invaded Iraq when he enlisted at 21; he was stationed in one of Saddam Hussein\u2019s former palaces in Baghdad. When fellow soldiers died, he sang tributes to them on a piano he found there. \u201cI was very blessed in the leaders I had,\u201d he says. \u201cThey all encouraged me in my music-making. They saw I had a different calling.\u201d His service completed, he met Tanya Blount in August 2010, when they played the same festival in Maryland. Tanya was on her second musical career \u2013 her first had peaked in her teens, when she appeared opposite Lauryn Hill and Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act 2 and signed a deal with Sean Combs\u2019s record label to become an R&amp;B star at 16. \u201cI knew at eight that this was what I wanted to do,\u201d says Tanya. But she took a break from the business after an unsatisfactory experience with Bad Boy Records. \u201cI\u2019d been in a pretentious world for pretty much most of my teens and 20s,\u201d says Tanya. \u201cIn R&amp;B, hip-hop, nothing\u2019s what they say it is. The car\u2019s not theirs, the chain\u2019s not theirs. Everything is rented.\u201d Michael, by comparison, was candid to a fault. They fell for each other at first sight. \u201cI remember her saying: \u2018I\u2019m not looking for a bank account, I\u2019m not looking for a six pack,\u201d says Michael. \u201cAnd I jumped for joy because I don\u2019t have neither.\u201d The sound they arrived at as a duo is the product of relentless work and ruthless honesty. \u201cWe\u2019d be doing eight hours of rehearsal at home, and if the song didn\u2019t move us we\u2019d trash it,\u201d says Michael. \u201cIf we\u2019re not feeling teary, or some emotional connection, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d Some of their most upbeat choruses hide the couple\u2019s trauma in plain sight. Five More Minutes was named for the day in 2017 that Michael had decided to end his life and Tanya asked him to stay with her just a little longer. Tanya has had her own brushes with mortality, including a frightening bout of Covid in the first wave of the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019d just performed at the Grammys, we\u2019d been invited to go on tour with John Legend, and then I thought Tanya was going to die,\u201d says Michael. \u201cLaying in the bed taught me: if you think you\u2019re there, you\u2019re never there,\u201d Tanya adds. \u201cNothing is promised.\u201d Their mantra, \u201cEvery day by grace\u201d, resonates with the church tradition they grew up in and they\u2019re not afraid to own the gospel roots of their music, says Michael. \u201cThat grit, that power, that resilience that is in Aretha Franklin\u2019s version of Amazing Grace; the reverence that is in Mahalia Jackson\u2019s How I Got Over. Gospel singers were placed in our world to be the uplifters. And for Tanya and me that\u2019s in our blood.

With a chihuahua called Diamond Baby kennelled in her designer handbag, this nepotistic partygoer juggled five mobile phones while cantering across continents to sell branded merchandise to the fans she smarmily addresses as \u201cmy Little Hiltons\u201d. Now, in her early 40s, she has published a memoir, which for ephemeral, unreflective celebrities like her is usually a way of fending off imminent obsolescence. The book \u2013 ventriloquised by Joni Rodgers, who describes herself as a \u201cstory whisperer\u201d \u2013 is as vapid and vaporous as the fragrances Hilton sells; all the same, archaeologists may one day consult it in the hope of understanding how and why our species underwent a final mutation into something glossily post-human. The antics of this entitled flibbertigibbet expose the absurdity of a culture in which the self only exists if it is validated by a selfie, membership of society depends on the mirage of social media and the reality in which we were all once anchored has been replaced by a flimsy virtual replica. The high-pitched tale begins in midair above Las Vegas, with a hungover Hilton sky-diving at dawn after \u201cthe greatest 21st birthday celebration since Marie Antoinette\u201d (a precursor whose fate she should bear in mind). Freefalling through an empty sky, Hilton recognises that she is a gilded speck of dust, buffeted by angry winds and plummeting towards annihilation. Then, once her parachute opens, she relaxes into an ecstatic state of grace, \u201csuspended above the desert like a diamond on a delicate silver chain\u201d. Her tumble becomes the descent of a biblical dove or perhaps the Virgin Mary\u2019s assumption in reverse; artfully envisaged as a piece of expensive jewellery, it convinces her that she is an astral phenomenon. \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Hilton insists, \u201cpretending to be, like, the Dalai Lama in Louboutins\u201d, but there\u2019s a dizzy spirituality to her account of following what she calls \u201cmy bliss\u201d and her rhapsodies about the beauty of the cosmic design. She later gabbles about \u201cgoing on this trip with the Dalai Lama and a bunch of other people\u201d: did she take His Holiness to party in Ibiza? Christ is invited to join her entourage, though his mission is to sprinkle dollar bills like stardust and instantly fulfil all wishes. \u201cI made the ask,\u201d Hilton tells us after suffering a few seconds of self-doubt, \u201cand like Jesus said, ask and it shall be given unto you.\u201d Schooled by the saviour, she drifts through the crowd at the Coachella Neon Carnival carrying a glitzy cluster of cheap tiaras \u201cso I can gift them as the spirit moves me\u201d. In the religion for which Paris evangelises, cosmetic pampering takes the place of prayer. \u201cSkin care is sacred,\u201d she declares in italics and she supplements the decalogue that Moses brought down from the mountain by adding her own 11th commandment: this recommends a slathering of sunscreen, her equivalent to extreme unction. \u201cWellness as an act of love\u201d is another of her slogans, with a day spa as its tabernacle. But she is sceptical about a heavenly reward for which you can only qualify by dying: after escaping from a series of reformatories set up to discipline bratty teenagers, she calculates the price of salvation and decides that \u201ca hundred million dollars would make me feel safe\u201d. Although she hobnobs with the Dalai Lama and expects Christ to make her mercenary dreams come true, Hilton truly belongs in Greek myth, where flighty nymphs are plucked from the Earth by lecherous gods and installed among the stars in return for their sexual favours. At the end of the book, portioning out her wisdom in bullet points, she suggests that we can elevate ourselves to immortality with no need for divine intervention. \u201cSee yourself,\u201d she counsels, \u201cas part of a galaxy.\u201d This air-headed mysticism merges with the digital revolution, which allowed Hilton to disseminate her image around the globe and to seep into our defenceless heads. She defines her success electronically, theorising that \u201cI was an amplifier and attention was the power cord\u201d that made her \u201ca marketable commodity\u201d. Cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse are another void into which she hurls herself, as if repeating that leap from the plane above Las Vegas: \u201cI jumped in,\u201d she says, \u201cwithout hesitation.\u201d \u201cEverything I do is tied up in swiftly advancing technology,\u201d she confides, referring to her sideline as a DJ and to the \u201cproduct development\u201d that turned her into \u201ca corporate-branding diva\u201d; she might also have mentioned the sex tape in which, thanks to a camera that could see in the dark, she thrashed about in bed with a poker player she was dating. Commercialised despite her protests, the tape was bizarrely dedicated to the victims of 9/11 with a solemn vow that \u201cwe will never forget\u201d. It certainly ensured that we never forgot Hilton, whose clitoris became clickbait and who subsequently embraced Twitter as her \u201cADHD wet dream\u201d. At one point, Hilton remembers that \u201cmy mom threw an epic, epic party\u201d. Like the yapping of a chihuahua, that adjective obsessively recurs, applied to lobsters liberated from a supermarket tank in a juvenile game, to a product launch for Juicy Couture, to her quest for true love and to anything else that takes her fancy. She has good reason for her constant recourse to the inflationary word. Like such classical epics as The Iliad or The Aeneid, this memoir is a saga of territorial conquest. To consolidate her triumph, Hilton is currently starting a family: having hired a surrogate to do the obstetric chores, she regrets missing out on a new wardrobe of \u201camazing maternity looks\u201d and has no Beyonc\u00e9 belly to document in selfies, but she keeps busy by scanning the map for cities, states and countries after which her offspring might be named. Her forthcoming son will be called Phoenix; any future daughter is to be christened London, which warns us of possible annexation. Yes, it\u2019s her world and after reading her book I just wish I could move off-planet. Paris: The Memoir by Paris Hilton is published by HQ (\u00a320).

The UK\u2019s biggest retailer said that after that date, shoppers would be able only to double the value of their Clubcard points \u2013 rather than triple them as now \u2013 when they spent them with one of its reward partners on a restaurant meal, day trip or cinema outing. When shoppers collect Clubcard points, they can be converted into Tesco vouchers to use in the supermarket, with each point worth 1p in store \u2013 so 500 points are worth \u00a35. However, when points are exchanged for codes to spend with the company\u2019s reward partners, they are worth 3p \u2013 so 500 points gets \u00a315. This will change on 14 June, when they will be be converted to be 2p, or \u00a310 for 500 points. Tesco has more than 100 reward partners at which vouchers can be used, such as Pizza Express, Legoland, Alton Towers, Cineworld and Hotels.com. A few years ago, the points were worth four times the store value when spent on rewards vouchers. Tesco said the latest revaluation would allow it to maintain a wide range of Clubcard rewards. When the grocer introduced its Clubcard in 1995, it reported a 28% spending uplift. Many shoppers expressed their disappointment on social media, with several writing on Twitter that they intended to switch to a different supermarket as a result. One tweeted: \u201cClubcard just became less of a reason to be loyal to the store, will be moving our shop to an alternative instead. Thanks for the memories Tesco.\u201d Another wrote: \u201cWe were always grateful for the Tesco Clubcard X4 when our kids were younger, it helped out massively on days out, we used our vouchers to buy towards Merlin passes which saved us so much money. We use it now for ourselves and X3 is good, but what an insult X2 is to customers!\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s and Boots also cut the value of loyalty schemes recently. From May, Boots Advantage card holders will get 25% less for every pound they spend in store, collecting 3p rather than 4p. Sainsbury\u2019s angered customers in 2015 when it halved the number of points they could collect on their Nectar cards, to one point for every \u00a31 spent at the supermarket. In November, Sainsbury\u2019s Bank slashed the number of Nectar points customers could earn by 75%, from two points for every \u00a31 spent, to one point for every \u00a32. In an email to customers, the Tesco chief customer officer, Alessandra Bellini, said the move would \u201cmake sure we can continue to provide you with a wide range of exciting rewards, while keeping our product prices low\u201d.

Those words, spoken as she perched like an avenging angel by the Magimix in my parents\u2019 kitchen, were her verdict on how I was shaping up. Megan as she was then \u2013 she switched to her middle name, Ennea, at 18 \u2013 had been dealt a rough hand. She had lost her mum aged six, her dad when she was 11, and was now living with my sixtysomething parents \u2013 who were off having a little breather for a week. Beforehand, I had been excited. My friends and I were still largely footloose. Children had novelty and anecdote-in-the-pub value. Perhaps even a little cachet? This will be great, I thought. I\u2019ll spend a week being, you know, sage and cool and firm and fair. More fool me, as they say. She didn\u2019t want to go to school \u2013 she had a cold and school was horrible \u2013 but I said she had to. She wasn\u2019t interested in my peppy exploration of negative numbers. Why couldn\u2019t I just do her maths homework, as quickly as possible, so she could watch television? And why wouldn\u2019t I sleep in her room? The house was old and creaky and scary. What was the big deal? Why wouldn\u2019t I? It got worse. On the Thursday, all jolly-jolly, I said it was movie night. I said we should watch Thelma &amp; Louise, picturing a wholesome lesson in female solidarity. She wanted to watch something else. I pressed play on my choice. Now, Thelma &amp; Louise is obviously amazing. I was nearly 14 when I first watched it, just about old enough to process the ugliness of the attempted rape scene near the start. Megan was too young. I realised I had made a mistake, but didn\u2019t turn it off. I didn\u2019t say: \u201cLook, sorry, I\u2019m being a massive idiot, let\u2019s watch your trashy film instead and I\u2019ll sleep in your room. Let\u2019s sack off school tomorrow, because it\u2019s just a day. And who knows what I\u2019m ever going to be to you, but one thing\u2019s for sure, I\u2019m not your keeper, so I\u2019ll just back right up, shall I?\u201d Why didn\u2019t I? Because I thought I was doing the right and proper thing, along with all the other right and proper things: the right A-levels, the right university, the right graduate scheme. But this thing \u2013 doing right by my little cousin \u2013 this I properly sucked at. Driving her home from school the next day, up a long, winding hill, I had to stop at a T-junction on the lip of a steep slope. I attempted a hill-start, but stalled. I tried again. Stalled again. And again \u2013 and again \u2013 and again. A Land Rover behind honked, swerved round us and roared off into the distance. Again I tried. She was in fits of hysterics. Laughing at myself wasn\u2019t my strongest suit back then, but pretty soon I was in hysterics, too. It took me, and I swear I\u2019m not exaggerating, 24 goes to get the car to bite. And with that, something between us reset. I could no longer cosplay the omniscient grownup. I was just a klutz who couldn\u2019t work a clutch. That night she wanted to make us a three-course meal \u2013 light candles, use the fancy plates. Idiot-me thought: urgh, mess, hassle, no way. Reset-me said: Yes, sure, great plan, and we\u2019ve never looked back. If we were Russian (I lived there in my mid-20s), I wouldn\u2019t even call her my cousin. I would call her my sister once removed, or just my sister, which is \u2013 luckily \u2013 what she has become. Superficially, like many sisters, removed or otherwise, we\u2019re pretty different. She\u2019s got innate business savvy, fighting post-Brexit red-tape to start Whim, her ethical swimwear brand. I\u2019m a writer, AKA a business wormhole. She\u2019s got an innate sense of style. I\u2019m winning if I\u2019m washed. And she\u2019s got innate zest, fizzing at parties on nothing stronger than elderflower cordial. I\u2019m an inveterate gen-X boozer. But none of that matters. As soon as I stopped trying to be the boss of her, we started to have fun together \u2013 and that is what we\u2019ve been doing ever since. We\u2019re even neighbours. In fact, we just walked our dogs together. She told me the day\u2019s gossip.

To celebrate the Balinese New Year, known as Nyepi, the island\u2019s usually busy streets have fallen quiet with residents and tourists expected to remain indoors for a day of quiet self-reflection. Reminiscent of recent lockdowns around the globe, and unlike any other New Year celebrations, the traditional start of the Balinese Saka calendar is welcomed with several days of island-wide rituals which centre around a day of silence. To mark Nyepi, everything from the Ngurah Rai International Airport to local supermarkets and ATMs are closed. Lasting 24 hours from 6am on 22 March, island residents and visitors are expected to shun entertainment, work, travel and even artificial light. The pecalang, a type of traditional Balinese security, patrol the streets to ensure that everyone \u2013 including tourists \u2013 complies. Balinese see Nyepi as a way to deter any returning evil spirits. To avoid attracting negative energy and embrace a purified start to the year, stay-at-home orders are put in place. Tourists and digital nomads that rely on good wifi tend to leave for Bali\u2019s neighbouring islands during this time. However, many among those that remain embrace the festival. \u201cI feel really lucky that I get to experience this because it\u2019s a really beautiful day,\u201d said Lotus Vrijma, 29, a Dutch traveller in Ubud. \u201cIt\u2019s special to know that you\u2019re doing it with so many other people on this island.\u201d \u201cI was shocked at how \u2018turned off\u2019 the island really is,\u201d fellow traveller Jackie Colello, 26, explained. She was looking forward to a day of self-contemplation and meditation from her Canggu guesthouse. While Indonesia is a majority Muslim country that will also mark the start of Ramadan on Wednesday, Bali\u2019s population is predominantly Hindu. The island largely practices a specific form of Balinese Hinduism that incorporates teachings from Buddhism as well as the worship of local deities. As a result, the island enjoys its own unique set of annual celebrations and festivities often featuring colourful parades and offerings. While the day provides a special moment of respite for the populous island, the run-up to Nyepi has been far from peaceful. There were busy scenes and long waits at supermarkets as people raced to gather supplies. Phone providers confirmed that cell service would be limited and many ATMs went out of service before Nyepi started. On the eve of the festival, Bali\u2019s communities held a parade to cleanse the island of evil spirits. Officially returning for its second year after pandemic restrictions were lifted, local groups had spent weeks constructing \u201cOgoh-Ogoh\u201d effigies that were paraded through Bali\u2019s dark streets before being burned in dramatic ceremonies. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have this slow day \u2026 in life, you need to have a pause,\u201d said Java native, Livia Ellen.

Prince William became the first member of the royal family to meet troops in Poland during a visit that was kept secret until after his arrival. He will also meet the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, while in the country. At an air defence military base in the south-eastern Polish city of Rzesz\u00f3w, he thanked British troops who are based roughly an hour\u2019s drive from the Ukrainian border for \u201cdefending our freedoms\u201d. He said their work to keep \u201can eye on\u201d the situation in Ukraine was \u201creally important\u201d. After arriving at the base on Wednesday afternoon, the prince, dressed casually in a black puffer jacket and trousers, was shown a missile launcher. Speaking to the soldiers, he said: \u201cI just wanted to come here in person to say thank you for all that you\u2019re doing, keeping everyone safe out here and keeping an eye on what\u2019s going on. So, just a big thank you for what you do on a day-to-day basis.\u201d He added: \u201cYou\u2019re doing a really important job out here and defending our freedoms is really important, and everyone back home thoroughly supports you.\u201d The base, made up of a coalition of British, Polish and US troops, is helping to support Ukraine. Major Richard Kaye, who met the prince, said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to protect critical national infrastructure in the region. We\u2019re absolutely privileged to host His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and privileged that he\u2019s chosen to come and visit us.\u201d William also visited Polish soldiers at the 3rd Brigade Territorial Defence Force base in Rzesz\u00f3w. He will later travel to an accommodation centre in Warsaw to meet Ukrainian refugees who have found sanctuary in the Polish capital. Landing in Warsaw, the prince said: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to be back in Poland. Our nations have strong ties. Through our cooperation in support of the people of Ukraine and their freedom, which are also our freedoms and yours, these ties are further strengthened. \u201cI\u2019m here because I want to personally thank the Polish and British troops working in close and crucial partnership. I also want to pay tribute to the inspiring humanity of the Polish people. You have opened your hearts as much as your homes. That\u2019s why this afternoon I visited Rzesz\u00f3w to meet troops based there to hear their stories and recognise their duty. \u201cI was struck by their passion as well as their shared determination to defend our shared freedoms.\u201d The accommodation centre houses about 300 women and children who have arrived in the country recently, providing residents with two meals a day and offers Polish language lessons, employment support, a children\u2019s play area, psychological support and kickboxing classes. William will hear from residents about their experiences before meeting volunteers. He spoke of wanting to \u201cunderline\u201d his continued support and gratitude to the Polish people. On Thursday, the prince will meet Duda at the presidential palace and visit a local food hall to speak with Ukrainian refugees. He will also lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a monument dedicated to Polish soldiers who lost their lives in conflict.

Barber is at home in Australia; I\u2019m in the UK, where it\u2019s 6am. I\u2019d been intending to have only a half-pint the night before and, well, the next minute, I am being woken up by my ringing phone. The first thing Barber says to me when I crash-land into the call is how good my bedhead looks: \u201cThat\u2019s not fair! You look amazing!\u201d she says, in the booster-ish way of your best friend. That\u2019s Celeste Barber for you: exactly who you\u2019d want to run into when your day is off to a bad start. The actor and \u201ccomedy queen\u201d has accumulated an audience of 9.4 million people on Instagram for her warm, down-to-earth, tells-it-like-it-is brand of humour. In particular Barber made her name by parodying the absurd outfits and awkward poses female celebrities routinely contort themselves into on Instagram. (Think: Barber trying to look sexy in a hammock, copying Kendall Jenner; or chugging a can of Pepsi in a self-conscious approximation of Cindy Crawford.) She started the social media series (#celestechallengeaccepted) in 2015, after steady work in TV as an actor and writer \u2013 including roles in The Matty Johns Show, the medical drama All Saints and the ABC series How Not to Behave. The parodies reliably went viral, gaining Barber many A-lister followers and launching her comedy career. She has since performed standup, written a satirical guide to \u201cbecoming an anti It-girl\u201d and two children\u2019s books, and collaborated on skits on social media for causes as disparate as the luxury fashion house Tom Ford and fundraising for bushfire relief. Last year she toured the UK and Europe, selling out most shows, for which Barber credits her engaged Instagram following \u2013 or as she calls them, \u201cher ladies\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re so good to me,\u201d she says. \u201cInstagram is one thing \u2026 how that would translate to buying a ticket is a different story.\u201d The theme across Barber\u2019s work, down to her very body \u2013 smaller than the average Australian woman, but bigger than most permitted a public profile \u2013 is that she is not a celebrity, but one of us: relatable above all else. Wellmania may change that, as Barber\u2019s first major on-screen role since becoming Insta-famous. The series is very loosely based on the nonfiction book of the same name by my former Guardian Australia colleague Brigid Delaney about her intrepid personal journey through the wellness industry. Delaney co-created the series with Benjamin Law. Barber, who also served as executive producer, had been approached about a potential adaptation before Netflix was even attached. \u201cI read the book and I was like, \u2018This is a brilliant idea\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI love Brigid\u2019s writing: she\u2019s very clever, very personable \u2013 and funny! Really funny \u2013 so I was on board from the beginning.\u201d It being half-five in Australia, Barber has a glass of red to hand \u2013 a natural pinot noir, she clarifies, a little shamefaced. \u201cI said to my husband: \u2018Well, we are these pricks now, who only drink organic wine.\u2019\u201d To be fair, it is better, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s better tomorrow as well,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t hurt as much.\u201d It is those sorts of topics that the book Wellmania explores: how to make both the pub and your early morning interview; how to have three glasses of wine but not feel them the next day; how to have your gluten-free cake and eat it too. Barber was drawn to Delaney\u2019s experiential and even-handed approach to the topical world of wellness and all its potential cures. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to poke fun at it \u2013 I\u2019ve made a career out of it \u2013 but this is a multibillion industry that can save lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of it might not be a fad \u2013 it might actually be quite good \u2013 but sometimes it is just bullshit. \u201cThe wellness industry is like the new form of church or organised religion: a lot of people find answers in it. It\u2019s so big, and so vast, you can pick and choose what helps you.\u201d The series Wellmania is a scripted fictional treatment inspired by those themes. Barber plays Liv Healy, an Australian lifestyle journalist and \u201chuman tornado\u201d working hard and playing hard in New York. On a dash back home for her friend\u2019s 40th, Liv finds herself stranded in Sydney by a health crisis, jeopardising the job of a lifetime back in the States. She will try anything to get well enough to fly, from colonics to cardio \u2013 anything except confront the costs of being permanently on the go. Liv is a more nuanced character than the hot mess that she might initially appear. She\u2019s self-involved, chaotic and outspoken, and sometimes thoughtless with it \u2013 especially at the expense of her friends and family (played by JJ Fong, Genevieve Mooy, Lachlan Buchanan, Remy Hii and Alexander Hodge). But she\u2019s also loyal, caring and resourceful. \u201cShe\u2019s really ambitious, she\u2019s really good at what she does, she\u2019s sought-after internationally \u2013 and a hot mess,\u201d says Barber. If Liv has a fatal flaw, it is her inability to accept her mortal limits \u2013 something many of us can relate to. Barber is conscious of it herself, having turned 40 last year. \u201cShe treats her body like an amusement park, this character, and she\u2019s at that stage in her life where you just fucking can\u2019t any more,\u201d she says, with knowing exasperation. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s relatable: whether you like it or not, you have to reassess.\u201d In its preoccupation with having it all, and looking good while doing it, Wellmania is a very Sydney show. It fondly sends up the city\u2019s culture of cocaine-and-green juice and \u201cleather-wearing vegans\u201d, Barber says. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing about wellness: a lot of it is for the elite, the privileged. A lot of it is \u2018Buy this $45 water bottle and it will make your husband not leave you\u2019.\u201d Barber wields that same bullshit detector on social media, highlighting the gap between Instagram and reality; and the money to be made by stoking women\u2019s anxieties. \u201cOn Instagram, I\u2019m making fun of [or] cutting down, cutting through the bullshit that is the body-shaming industry. The beauty industry, the fashion industry \u2013 I just don\u2019t fuck around with that \u2013 I think it\u2019s bullshit; I\u2019m having a go.\u201d Her comedy aims to provoke, and often succeeds. Cindy Crawford recently responded to Barber\u2019s parody of her infamous Pepsi commercial with cry-laughing emojis. Model and writer Emily Ratajkowski was less magnanimous, blocking Barber for mocking her nearly naked photoshoot. Barber shrugged it off at the time (\u201cI like running my mouth off\u201d) but her parodies have also drawn criticism for singling out individual women rather than the sexist systems they are operating within. Already there are signs her everywoman-in-a-string-bikini shtick may have a shelf life. A splashy 2019 magazine photoshoot of Barber alongside actor and activist Jameela Jamil, in particular, seemed to be more mocking than self-effacing; and in January she drew some criticism for a swimsuit spread in Marie Claire that appeared to have been heavily airbrushed. Either way, as Barber\u2019s star rises it brings her into ever-closer contact with the gendered glitz and showbiz shallowness she\u2019s spent the best part of a decade poking fun at. \u201cI always feel like I\u2019m a model; I just don\u2019t think anyone else has ever caught on to it,\u201d Barber jokes. But it\u2019s true, she says, \u201cthere has been a shift in how what I do on Instagram is perceived\u201d. Her aim has always been to make people laugh, Barber says \u2013 but in recent years she has found herself going easier on her targets. \u201cI think subconsciously, I\u2019ve been a little bit lighter with the content that I create, going purely for \u2018this is funny\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that I also have a profile and I\u2019m now entering into that space \u2026 But a lot of the time it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m going to look stupid doing this \u2013 and that\u2019s hilarious.\u2019\u201d Barber never intended to be a body-positivity advocate, she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s a movement I\u2019m very happy to be part of\u201d. She recalls a woman telling her that her daughter had replaced posters of \u201cgorgeous, skinny models\u201d on her bedroom walls with pictures of Barber. \u201cThat makes me so happy \u2013 and that\u2019s why I went on the cover of magazines.\u201d Too often, she says, women are given an either-or choice. Wellmania, the TV series, asks what it really means to be well \u2013 sustainably, not through quick fixes or a total transformation. For Barber, who has two young sons and ageing parents, the question feels especially relevant. \u201cIt\u2019s at the forefront of my mind, making sure that I am on top of my health, my mental health, my relationship, all of it. It\u2019s not like Liv: go-go-go-go-go-go, until you explode.\u201d Barber herself strives for balance \u2013 a bit of yoga to clear her head and, likewise, an after-work wine \u2013 and to take what works for her, and to leave the rest. \u201cThat\u2019s the curiosity of the wellness industry, isn\u2019t it: some of it might save your life \u2013 but not that $45 water bottle.\u201d Sympathetic, again, with my early start, Barber suggests I begin with a coffee. \u2022 Wellmania is on Netflix globally from 29 March \u2022 This article was amended on 22 March 2023 to correct the name of JJ Fong.", "date": "2023-03-22", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Elle Hunt", "id": 62, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/abc2d5de2c03e201f81f40e01efe24f962fb8dc9/0_0_6820_4092/500.jpg"}, {"title": "People in France: tell us about taking part in recent protests", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/23/people-in-france-pensions-tell-us-about-taking-part-in-recent-protests", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.048, "neu": 0.717, "pos": 0.236, "compound": 0.7059}, "body": "Protesters have gathered across France to demonstrate their opposition to the pension age being raised from 62 to 64, with 200 demonstrations expected on Thursday.

The award is for writers aged 39 or under, and is open to all forms of literature. This year\u2019s shortlist of six comprises three novels, two short story collections and one book of poetry. Di Speirs, chair of the judges and books editor at BBC Audio, said the list exemplified \u201cnot only the talent and excitingly fresh, often startling, writing we were seeking, but draw the reader in and on\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s wit and wisdom, pleasure and pain, acute observation of the natural world and of human relationships and above all, so much to savour,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat we all agreed so clearly on our shortlist is testament to the strength of this potent mix of poetry, short stories and novels and to the power of the six writers.\u201d Joining Speirs on the judging panel are prize-winning Welsh author and lecturer in English at Swansea University, Jon Gower; 2012 winner of the Swansea University Dylan Thomas prize Maggie Shipstead; poet and the founder of Octavia Poetry Collective for Women of Colour, Rachel Long; and Nepali-Indian author and 2013 prize shortlistee Prajwal Parajuly. Three British writers are shortlisted for the prize: Warsan Shire, Sheena Patel and Saba Sams. Shire makes the list for her debut poetry collection Bless the Daughter Raised By a Voice in Her Head, which Mary Jean Chan described in the Guardian as \u201cvital, moving and courageous\u201d. Although Somali British writer Shire only released her first collection in 2022, she had previously featured on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade and Black Is King. Shipstead said Bless the Daughter Raised By a Voice in Her Head \u201cis the kind of poetry collection that takes up residence in your psyche and becomes a part of you, echoing when you least expect it\u201d. Patel is shortlisted for I\u2019m a Fan, her debut novel which was recently longlisted for the Women\u2019s prize for fiction and the Jhalak prize. Describing it as a critique of social media and heteronormative relationships, Lamorna Ash in the Guardian called it a \u201ccorrosive, brilliant debut\u201d. Speirs said the judges \u201cloved Patel\u2019s book for its immediacy, vibrancy and shafts of spiky humour\u201d. Sams is the youngest author on this year\u2019s shortlist, at 26, and is shortlisted for her short story collection Send Nudes, which highlights the confusing double standards facing women today. Madeleine Feeny in her Guardian review said Sams presented \u201cacute portraits of the fragile intimacies and euphoric moments snatched by a generation of women coming of age into a precarious future\u201d. Long described Send Nudes as an \u201cexciting, empowering collection of short stories, full of knowing, daring, wit and range\u201d. The list is completed by three international writers: Ireland\u2019s Sara Baume, Australia\u2019s Robbie Arnott, and Nigeria\u2019s Arinze Ifeakandu. Baume is nominated for her poetic third novel Seven Steeples, which depicts a couple escaping into the wilds of south-west Ireland. Barney Norris in the Guardian called it a \u201cglacially beautiful book\u201d. Gower said Baume had \u201ccreated a marvellously shambolic and memorable pair of characters\u201d and described the book as \u201ctender and true\u201d. Arnott is shortlisted for his third novel Limberlost, which transports readers to the Tasmanian wilderness with its story of the life of one man. Melissa Harrison in the Guardian said: \u201cArnott has an eye and an ear for description that can elevate otherwise quiet moments to something genuinely transcendent.\u201d Parajuly said the prize judges loved the book \u201cfor its stunning sentences, its quiet meditation on masculinity, and its ability to conjure up (as well as transport us to) 1940s Tasmania\u201d. Ifeakandu is shortlisted for his short story collection, God\u2019s Children Are Little Broken Things, which explores what it means to be a queer male in his home country. Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, in an interview in the Observer, said it was a \u201ctremendous book\u201d. Shipstead said God\u2019s Children Are Little Broken Things brought \u201cincisive authorial insight and compassionate, compelling humanity to the lives of its characters\u201d.

What\u2019s a night agent, I hear you ask? Well, in this case, he is an FBI agent called Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso), who saves a bunch of ordinary joes from a bomb on a subway train. For some reason, he is put on desk duties in the basement of the White House, doing admin while he waits by a helpline phone that undercover operatives can call to let the powers-that-be know they are in trouble. But that darn phone never rings. Peter does his admin conscientiously, but you know that in his heart of hearts he would like some thrills \u2013 maybe even of a political nature. As luck would have it, across town, a (professional and romantic) couple of undercover operatives are in trouble. Just before they have to fight for their lives \u2013 but just after we hear them whispering about a possible Russian mole in the White House \u2013 they dispatch their niece Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) to a phone down the street to call \u2026 yes. The phone! The phone! While our undercover lovers are being killed, the president\u2019s chief-of-staff, Diane Farr (Hong Chau), puts Peter in charge of keeping Rose safe. \u201cIf she called your number, this is more important than you can imagine,\u201d she says. \u201cI trust you completely.\u201d I have many questions about this (and more about why they chose to put a 43-year-old actor in such a cheap grey wig, like the Witch of Endor in a business suit), but there is no time to ask, because more plot is happening! The script is finding its feet as we go! This includes two car chases, much shooting, some running out of bullets, a safe house, a gun safe in a coffee table, a villain with a ring bearing the crest of the Royal House of Yugoslavia that Peter suspects may be a clue, villains without any rings, and a particularly ruthless Bonnie and Clyde couple, possibly of Russian extraction. This is all before Rose tells Peter that Aunt and Uncle Spy were worried there was a mole in the White House. Now, they can trust no one and have to go rogue. It is propulsive, slicker-than-slick fun, with every hairpin turn perfectly negotiated. There are fine performances \u2013 especially from Basso, who is getting two or three notes out of what could easily have been a one-note part. It gives you that warm feeling you get when you come across something a little bit better than it needs to be. You could not ask for more out of your adaptation of a bestselling political thriller about a night agent. I feel as if I am about one and a half measures of plot away from losing the thread entirely, but I feel like that a lot. The showrunner is Shawn Ryan, most recently responsible for the show S.W.A.T., but who was also behind one of the cleverest, most underrated police series of recent decades. The Shield was an extraordinary creation \u2013 brilliant long and short narrative arcs examining the corruption of the system and the soul, excellent performances \u2013 not just from the mainstays such as Michael Chiklis, Jay Karnes and Walton Goggins, but also from guest stars such as Forest Whitaker, who was unforgettable \u2013 and characters of a complexity to rival anything in The Wire. I wonder how much Ryan longs to get his teeth into something like that again? You couldn\u2019t blame him if he was still, 15 years on, recovering from seven seasons of interrogating all the ways men can brutalise each other. And their cats. (If you know, you know. Goddamn, Dutch \u2026) Anyway, The Night Agent is set fair to deliver a lot of bang for your 10-episode buck. I think the mole is hiding under Diane\u2019s wig. Also, now that I have realised whom Basso reminds me of (a finer-featured Richard Madden in Bodyguard), I can hopefully concentrate a bit better and not lose the thread of things until maybe three or even four episodes in. I look forward to finding out. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 March 2023 to correct the first name of actor Walton Goggins.

And there has never been a time we\u2019ve needed his dismal optimism more. It\u2019s hard to read an article or listen to a podcast these days without doomsayers telling us we\u2019ve pushed our luck with artificial intelligence, our hubris is coming back to haunt us and robots are taking over the world. There are stories of chatbots becoming best friends, declaring their love, trying to disrupt stable marriages, and threatening chaos on a global scale. Is AI really capable of outsmarting us and taking over the world? \u201cOK! Well, your question makes no sense,\u201d Lanier says in his gentle sing-song voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve just used the set of terms that to me are fictions. I\u2019m sorry to respond that way, but it\u2019s ridiculous \u2026 it\u2019s unreal.\u201d This is the stuff of sci-fi movies such as The Matrix and Terminator, he says. Lanier doesn\u2019t even like the term artificial intelligence, objecting to the idea that it is actually intelligent, and that we could be in competition with it. \u201cThis idea of surpassing human ability is silly because it\u2019s made of human abilities.\u201d He says comparing ourselves with AI is the equivalent of comparing ourselves with a car. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying a car can go faster than a human runner. Of course it can, and yet we don\u2019t say that the car has become a better runner.\u201d I flush and smile. Flush because I\u2019m embarrassed, smile because I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019ll take my bollocking happily, I say. He squeals with laughter. \u201cHehehehe! OK. Hehehehe!\u201d But he doesn\u2019t want us to get complacent. There\u2019s plenty left to worry about: human extinction remains a distinct possibility if we abuse AI, and even if it\u2019s of our own making, the end result is no prettier. Lanier, 62, has worked alongside many of the web\u2019s visionaries and power-brokers. He is both insider (he works at Microsoft as an interdisciplinary scientist, although he makes it clear that today he is talking on his own behalf) and outsider (he has constantly, and presciently, exposed the dangers the web presents). He is also one of the most distinctive men on the planet \u2013 a raggedy prophet with ginger dreads, a startling backstory, an eloquence to match his gargantuan brain and a giggle as alarming as it is life-enhancing. Although a tech guru in his own right, his mission is to champion the human over the digital \u2013 to remind us we created the machines, and artificial intelligence is just what it says on the tin. In books such as You Are Not a Gadget and Ten Reasons For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts, he argues that the internet is deadening personal interaction, stifling inventiveness and perverting politics. We meet on Microsoft\u2019s videoconference platform Teams so that he can show a recent invention of his that enables us to appear in the same room together even though we are thousands of miles apart. But the technology isn\u2019t working in the most basic sense. He can\u2019t see me. Doubtless he\u2019ll be pleased in a way. There\u2019s nothing Lanier likes more than showing technology can go wrong, especially when operated by an incompetent at the other end. So we switch to the rival Zoom. Lanier\u2019s backdrop is full of musical instruments, including a row of ouds hanging from the ceiling. In his other life, he is a professional contemporary classical musician \u2013 a brilliant player of rare and ancient instruments. Often he has used music to explain the genius and limitations of tech. At its simplest, digital technology works in a on/off way, like the keys on a keyboard, and lacks the endless variety of a saxophone or human voice. \u201cFrom my perspective,\u201d he says, \u201cthe danger isn\u2019t that a new alien entity will speak through our technology and take over and destroy us. To me the danger is that we\u2019ll use our technology to become mutually unintelligible or to become insane if you like, in a way that we aren\u2019t acting with enough understanding and self-interest to survive, and we die through insanity, essentially.\u201d Now I\u2019m feeling less relieved. Death by insanity doesn\u2019t sound too appealing, and it can come in many forms \u2013 from world leaders or terrorists screwing with global security AI to being driven bonkers by misinformation or bile on Twitter. Lanier says the more sophisticated technology becomes, the more damage we can do with it, and the more we have a \u201cresponsibility to sanity\u201d. In other words, a responsibility to act morally and humanely. Lanier was the only child of Jewish parents who knew all about inhumanity. His Viennese mother was blond and managed to talk her way out of a concentration camp by passing as Aryan. She then moved to the US, working as a pianist and stocks trader. His father, whose family had been largely wiped out in Ukrainian pogroms, had a range of jobs from architect to science editor of pulp science-fiction magazines and eventually elementary-school teacher. Lanier was born in New York, but the family soon moved west. When he was nine, his mother was killed after her car flipped over on the freeway on her way back from passing her driving test. Both father and son were left traumatised and impoverished; his mother had been the main breadwinner. The two of them moved to New Mexico, living in tents before 11-year-old Lanier started to design their new house, a geodesic dome that took seven years to complete. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good structurally, but it was good therapeutically,\u201d he says. In his 2017 memoir, Dawn of the New Everything, Lanier wrote that the house looked \u201ca little like a woman\u2019s body. You could see the big dome as a pregnant belly and the two icosahedrons as breasts.\u201d He was ludicrously bright. At 14, he enrolled at New Mexico State University, taking graduate-level courses in mathematical notation, which led him to computer programming. He never completed his degree, but went to art school and flunked out. By the age of 17 he was working a number of jobs, including goat-keeper, cheese-maker and assistant to a midwife. Then, by his early 20s, he had became a researcher for Atari in California. When he was made redundant, he focused on virtual reality projects, co-founding VPL Research to commercialise VR technologies. He could have easily been a tech billionaire had he sold his businesses sensibly or at least shown a little interest in money. As it stands, he tells me he has done very nicely financially, and obscene wealth wouldn\u2019t have sat with his values. Today, he lives in Santa Cruz in California with his wife and teenage daughter. Although many of the digital gurus started out as idealists, to Lanier there was an inevitability that the internet would screw us over. We wanted stuff for free (information, friendships, music), but capitalism doesn\u2019t work like that. So we became the product \u2013 our data sold to third parties to sell us more things we don\u2019t need. \u201cI wrote something that described how what we now call bots will be turned into these agents of manipulation. I wrote that in the early 90s when the internet had barely been turned on.\u201d He squeals with horror and giggles. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s 30 years ago!\u201d Actually, he believes bots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Bard could provide hope for the digital world. Lanier was always dismayed that the internet gave the appearance of offering infinite options but in fact diminished choice. Until now, the primary use of AI algorithms has been to choose what videos we would like to see on YouTube, or whose posts we\u2019ll see on social media platforms. Lanier believes it has made us lazy and incurious. Beforehand, we would sift through stacks in a record shop or browse in bookshops. \u201cWe were directly connected to a choice base that was actually larger instead of being fed this thing through this funnel that somebody else controls.\u201d Take the streaming platforms, he says. \u201cNetflix once had a million-dollar prize contest to improve their algorithm, to help people sort through this gigantic space of streaming options. But it has never had that many choices. The truth is you could put all of Netflix\u2019s streaming content on one scrollable page. This is another area where we have a responsibility to sanity, he says \u2013 not to narrow our options or get trapped in echo chambers, slaves to the algorithm. That\u2019s why he loves playing live music \u2013 because every time he jams with a band, he creates something new. For Lanier, the classic example of restricted choice is Wikipedia, which has effectively become the world\u2019s encyclopedia. \u201cWikipedia is run by super-nice people who are my friends. But the thing is it\u2019s like one encyclopedia. Some of us might remember when on paper there was both an Encyclopedia Britannica and Encyclopedia Americana and they provided different perspectives. The notion of having the perfect encyclopedia is just weird.\u201d So could the new chatbots challenge this? \u201cRight. That\u2019s my point. If you go to a chatbot and say: \u2018Please can you summarise the state of the London tube?\u2019 you\u2019ll get different answers each time. And then you have to choose.\u201d This programmed-in randomness, he says, is progress. \u201cAll of a sudden this idea of trying to make the computer seem humanlike has gone far enough in this iteration that we might have naturally outgrown this illusion of the monolithic truth of the internet or AI. It means there is a bit more choice and discernment and humanity back with the person who\u2019s interacting with the thing.\u201d That\u2019s all well and good, but what about AI replacing us in the workplace? We already have the prospect of chatbots writing articles like this one. Again, he says it\u2019s not the technology that replaces us, it\u2019s how we use it. \u201cThere are two ways this could go. One is that we pretend the bot is a real thing, a real entity like a person, then in order to keep that fantasy going we\u2019re careful to forget whatever source texts were used to have the bot function. Journalism would be harmed by that. The other way is you do keep track of where the sources came from. And in that case a very different world could unfold where if a bot relied on your reporting, you get payment for it, and there is a shared sense of responsibility and liability where everything works better. The term for that is data dignity.\u201d It seems too late for data dignity to me; the dismal optimist is in danger of being a utopian optimist here. But Lanier soon returns to Planet Bleak. \u201cYou can use AI to make fake news faster, cheaper and on greater scales. That combination is where we might see our extinction.\u201d In You Are Not a Gadget, he wrote that the point of digital technology was to make the world more \u201ccreative, expressive, empathic and interesting\u201d. Has it achieved that? \u201cIt has in some cases. There\u2019s a lot of cool stuff on the internet. I think TikTok is dangerous and should be banned yet I love dance culture on TikTok and it should be cherished.\u201d Why should it be banned? \u201cBecause it\u2019s controlled by the Chinese, and should there be difficult circumstances there are lots of horrible tactical uses it could be put to. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an acceptable risk. It\u2019s heartbreaking because a lot of kids love it for perfectly good reasons.\u201d As for Twitter, he says it has brought out the worst in us. \u201cIt has a way of taking people who start out as distinct individuals and converging them into the same personality, optimised for Twitter engagement. That personality is insecure and nervous, focused on personal slights and affronted by claims of rights by others if they\u2019re different people. The example I use is Trump, Kanye and Elon [Musk, who now owns Twitter]. Ten years ago they had distinct personalities. But they\u2019ve converged to have a remarkable similarity of personality, and I think that\u2019s the personality you get if you spend too much time on Twitter. It turns you into a little kid in a schoolyard who is both desperate for attention and afraid of being the one who gets beat up. You end up being this phoney who\u2019s self-concerned but loses empathy for others.\u201d It\u2019s a brilliant analysis that returns to his original point \u2013 our responsibility to sanity. Does Lanier\u2019s responsibility to his own sanity keep him off social media? He smiles. \u201cI always thought social media was bullshit. It was obviously just this dumb thing from the beginning.\u201d There is much about the internet of which he is still proud. He says that virtual reality headsets now used are little different from those he introduced in the 1980s, and his work on surgical simulation has had huge practical benefits. \u201cI know many people whose lives have been saved by the furtherance of this stuff I was demonstrating 40 years ago. My God! I\u2019m so old now!\u201d He stops to question whether he\u2019s overstating his influence, stressing that he was only involved at the beginning. There is also huge potential, he says, for AI to help us tackle climate change, and save the planet. But he has also seen the very worst of AI. \u201cI know people whose kids have committed suicide with a very strong online algorithm contribution. So in those cases life was taken. It might not be possible from this one human perspective to say for sure what the giant accounting ledger would tell us now, but whatever that answer would be I\u2019m certain we could have done better, and I\u2019m sure we can and must do better in the future.\u201d Again, that word, human. The way to ensure that we are sufficiently sane to survive is to remember it\u2019s our humanness that makes us unique, he says. \u201cA lot of modern enlightenment thinkers and technical people feel that there is something old-fashioned about believing that people are special \u2013 for instance that consciousness is a thing. They tend to think there is an equivalence between what a computer could be and what a human brain could be.\u201d Lanier has no truck with this. \u201cWe have to say consciousness is a real thing and there is a mystical interiority to people that\u2019s different from other stuff because if we don\u2019t say people are special, how can we make a society or make technologies that serve people?\u201d Lanier looks at his watch, and apologises. \u201cYou know what, I actually have to go to a dentist\u2019s appointment.\u201d The real world intervenes and asserts its supremacy over the virtual.

I didn\u2019t want to become a human jukebox playing old songs, so I filled the space the band took with films and TV and now my shows, my radio show and writing. At this point, I wouldn\u2019t go back on stage with a band for anything. Jingle Bells with William Shatner is a fantastic song. Are there any future music collaborations on the horizon?

He\u2019s just fun to work with. It was the same with the Flaming Lips in 2009. They\u2019re people I know, but, generally, I\u2019ve hung up my shield and sword. How was the experience of working on the film Heat? Prestonian79 The director, Michael Mann, said: \u201cYour character has scenes with Al Pacino, but if Al doesn\u2019t like you, you can\u2019t be in the movie. So we\u2019re going to have lunch to see if he likes you.\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cUh? When?\u201d He goes: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now.\u201d We walked out with my jaw on the floor and went to some high-class Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills. Al\u2019s like: \u201cCall me Al.\u201d At the end of the lunch, he goes: \u201cMichael, I like him.\u201d Every day on set, I\u2019d go: \u201cHow are you, sir?\u201d Al would put his hand on my shoulder, say: \u201cHenry, not so good,\u201d and tell me in great detail about how he\u2019d pulled a muscle in his arm. He was hilarious to be around. There\u2019s one scene where I\u2019m handcuffed, so Al would sit on a couch and keep me company while I was being unlocked: \u201cSomeone give me a magic marker. I\u2019m gonna draw a moustache on Henry.\u201d When you\u2019re getting razzed by Al Pacino, how bad is your day? Is touring a spoken-word show less stressful than a full-band tour? 2HeadedDog Doing the music was like gladiator sport. I\u2019d lose three pounds of water every show. I\u2019ve ripped up my back and my neck, and my jaw clicks from being smashed around. The talking shows are more demanding, because it\u2019s only me on stage. It\u2019s like comparing surgery with construction \u2013 one requires super concentration and the other is just physical. And on the bus it\u2019s not a tribe of stenchy men! It\u2019s four non-smoking, low-key individuals. Backstage, it\u2019s just me. I heard the sad news about the death of Glen \u201cSpot\u201d Lockett [the influential Black Flag and SST Records producer] . Do you have a story to share, or a favourite album that he produced? HJayJay Spot had a very old-school way of recording: fewer microphones, less mixing, everything live, like he was cutting a Charlie Parker side. My favourite album he did is The Punch Line by Minutemen, from 1981. They were very argumentative, so Spot would go: \u201cOK, that\u2019s the take. Shut up,\u201d and they were smart enough to listen. I\u2019ve never met anyone like him. He would go around for days wearing roller-skates. When Black Flag recorded Damaged, Greg Ginn wanted to hear what it sounded like in the studio, so Spot picked up Greg\u2019s guitar and while the band were playing he absolutely nailed the track Damaged II, which is like math rock. Greg was an astonishing guitarist, but he was totally shut down. It was hilarious. The chess master got checkmated. Your KCRW radio shows are a joy. Which radio DJs inspired and entertained you? VerulamiamParkRanger My mom took me to see American Graffiti and the character Wolfman Jack\u2019s scenes were so charismatic. I became obsessed with the idea of a mystical voice talking through a clock radio at night who saves your life through music. At KCRW, my late, great friend Deirdre O\u2019Donoghue first taught me how to do it. I\u2019ve been on the station for 14 years and my show is listened to all over the world. When you put together your playlist for your radio show, what are you looking for in a new artist? Zenon73 To like their music. That\u2019s it. When I was in a band, I always wanted someone to play us on the radio to help us over the wall, so if someone recommends a new band that I like, I\u2019m all over their Bandcamp and buy their entire catalogue. I love the forthcoming album by Snooper from Nashville. It\u2019s a fun record, all 23 minutes of it. When I was 14, I wrote to all the bands that inspired me. You were one of the few who cared enough to reply. Did you ever write to your heroes? JimKrimson No, but I came from the Washington DC punk scene, which was very egalitarian. When a young person writes to me, I\u2019d never not write back, because I believe in young people. I don\u2019t want to shut down their enthusiasm. What are your memories of your time at 52 Harold Mount, Leeds, and recording those early solo/Rollins Band records at Off Beat Studios? Davehumanfly Chris Haskett from the Rollins Band was living in Leeds, so we made records there and camped out in his freezing flat with a coin-operated meter. The local store served the best onion bhajis I\u2019ve ever had and the owner was forever trying to set Chris up with his daughter. I learned the land of the whole area. We borrowed a mic from the Mekons and we played the Duchess of York several times. One night, some guy said: \u201cJimi Hendrix was basically British.\u201d I went: \u201cRight, sit down. You\u2019re going to get schooled on the state of Washington,\u201d and totally went off on this guy. Your 1994 essay Iron and the Soul, outlining how and why you came to start lifting weights, is up there with Sven Lindqvist\u2019s Bench Press book in redefining reasons for strength training. What is your exercise regime like now? KingOfLuxembourg I work out six days a week: big pull day, big push day, small push day, a day for abdominals and the rest is cardio. I\u2019m onstage for two and a half hours talking at high speed, and this one leg of the tour is 44 shows straight, so that calorie burn in the afternoon prepares me mentally. As a teenager, I couldn\u2019t throw a ball straight and nobody wanted to play with me. My teacher taught me to lift weights and the gym has been my happy place ever since. You have a vast record collection; which record do you have the most versions of? Zenon73 I have lots of different pressings of the first Damned album and the first three Buzzcocks albums. Different pressings of Hendrix albums are interesting, especially the South African ones, because during apartheid they didn\u2019t want a non-white guy\u2019s face on the cover. Bowie 7ins from the Philippines are super hard to find and always in bad condition. I buy every Joy Division bootleg. It\u2019s basically the same eight shows, but until I have every pressing my life is not complete. How did you come to be in possession of the original artwork for the Ruts\u2019 classic 1979 British punk album The Crack? Ferret76 Segs [John Jennings] from the Ruts told me that the painter, John Howard, took it to New York and the band never saw it again. I found John Howard and he told me that he sold it to an art collector who just thought it was a cool picture of a party. He gave me an insanely low price. A while later, Segs told me the back cover artwork had turned up in an auction house in Suffolk, so I bought that as well. Your mention of electric-era Miles Davis triggered my long-time love and obsession. What are you listening to that might be related? MisterFrisky I was raised on Miles, but my mom she said she no longer understood him during the electric era. So, in Rollins Band, my bandmates were amazed I\u2019d never heard On the Corner and sat me down and played it. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything like it, but on the bus my road manager has been playing east European 1970s jazz, so I\u2019ve been tracking down records by all these bands whose names I can\u2019t remember. What are you memories of performing in Ukraine \u2013 and would you perform in Kyiv or Moscow now? surgical Kyiv was really beautiful and the audiences were really thoughtful and appreciative. Russian audiences were always fantastic. Going to Ukraine would be making light of the situation, unless I could afford the flights myself and do a show for free, a sort of tonic for the troops, like I used to do with USO [United Service Organizations, a live-entertainment charity for the US armed forces] in Iraq and Afghanistan. I wouldn\u2019t go to Russia now for fear of something being dropped into my tea. In your recent book Sic, you mentioned that you have moved to Nashville to realise a major project. What is it? Colindardis It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working on for a couple of years with my manager, Heidi May, and I\u2019ve put my life savings into it. All I can say is that we\u2019re looking at launching 14 months from now in Nashville and it will make people smile until their faces hurt. \u2022 Henry Rollins\u2019 UK tour begins on 24 March at De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea", "date": "2023-03-23", "section": "Culture", "author": "As told to Dave Simpson", "id": 67, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/22c57532ab6bcb30835bcb5a85cea6893ec16e9b/849_1493_2834_1700/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Hits and myths: why has Hollywood abandoned ancient Greece?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/24/hits-and-myths-why-has-hollywood-abandoned-ancient-greece", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.072, "neu": 0.725, "pos": 0.204, "compound": 0.997}, "body": "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King will be back in North American cinemas next month, to celebrate 20 years since Peter Jackson first debuted his Oscar-winning film. Its return to the multiplexes comes at a time when we seem to have more JRR Tolkien-inspired fantasies to choose from than a 1980s branch of Games Workshop. As well as Gollum and co returning to the big screen, we have the baffling, utterly superfluous yet sumptuously filmed and geekily delightful small screen The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power TV show. Then next year there will be The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, an animated venture with Brian Cox as Helm Hammerhand and Jackson alumnus Miranda Otto as Eowyn (who will take the narrator\u2019s role for the forthcoming prequel about the legendary warrior king of Rohan). We are also promised several new live-action movies based on Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth, after a deal struck by rights holder Embracer Group and studios Warner Bros and New Line. Jackson and his two closest Lord of the Rings collaborators, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens, have said they are being kept in the loop \u201cevery step of the way\u201d about the new films. Meanwhile, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is about to hit cinemas, bringing back to the screen the American role-playing franchise inspired by Tolkien. Starring Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez and Hugh Grant, it looks a lot more silly and a lot less po-faced than the Jackson movies, and yet we are still talking about a tale of perky elves, wise wizards and nasty necromancers. If Sam and Frodo turned up halfway through to reveal that a new ring of power had been discovered that gives its user the ability to ride Ents and engage Balrogs in polite conversation, nobody would be the least bit surprised. But wonderful as all this stuff isai, the ubiquity of Tolkienesque drama is overshadowing the fact that this is not the only way to make fantasy movies, or even deliver swords and sorcery on the big screen. When Jackson was a toddler, long before Lord of the Rings had first been adapted for screen (via Ralph Bakshi\u2019s ill-fated 1978 attempt), there was 1963\u2019s Jason and the Argonauts, Don Chaffey\u2019s glorious tale of gods and stop-motion monsters. The scene in which Jason battles seven living skeletons, which apparently took the celebrated stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen months to create, still gives me the willies. The final film Harryhausen worked on, 1981\u2019s Clash of the Titans, had the spine-chilling Medusa scene to equal it. Chaffey\u2019s aim was to bring Greek mythology to life for film audiences, replete with new deities, demigods and other assorted celestial beings. Yet Hollywood seems to have forgotten about this great pantheon of stories that are ripe for the plucking. Where are the soaring, splendid movies \u2013 especially given the remarkable advances in special effects since Harryhausen\u2019s day \u2013 about brave but reckless Theseus and the minotaur, or Bellerophon and Pegasus, the winged horse? Why have the 12 tasks of Heracles been forgotten while Homer\u2019s Odyssey, perhaps the ultimate tale of a fantasy quest, languishes in cinematic obscurity? Perhaps studios think that the abject failure of 2010\u2019s Clash of the Titans remake, and its useless sequel, 2012\u2019s Wrath of the Titans, is reason enough to abandon Mount Olympus. But those movies were directed by Louis Leterrier and Jonathan Liebesman; Lord of the Rings got Jackson and his team. It\u2019s hardly a fair contest. A couple of half-baked Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief movies from the early 00s were not enough to shake up the picture. These days the ancient Greek tales are most likely to inspire comic-book movies. DC\u2019s Wonder Woman is inspired by Artemis, the Greek goddess of the hunt (though she has been bestowed instead with the deity\u2019s Roman equivalent, Diana) as well as the warrior goddess Athena. Russell Crowe played a fittingly pompous and effete Zeus in the recent Marvel movie Thor: Love and Thunder, while Aquaman has definite shades of Poseidon. But superhero movies about godlike deities often seem to miss out on the gravitas and majesty of the original myths that inspired them, partly because there is a temptation to slip into comedy fish-out-of-water territory when such beings come into contact with 21st-century humanity. I\u2019m not sure I want to see Perseus joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Jason, leader of the Argonauts, battling Batman.

The charity said the year-long programme, which started in December and delivers classes to women and girls across Afghanistan, may now be forced to close this month. Save the Children is scrambling to secure funds to continue the work, which provides a lifeline for many who face the risk of early marriage, violence and other forms of exploitation. Gwen Hines, CEO of Save the Children UK, said: \u201cAfghan children are already dying from hunger and disease, and now face having funding for basic food, health and education programmes withdrawn by the British government. \u201cThe decision to cut millions in funding to Afghan children sends a stark message to the world that the UK is turning its back on the most vulnerable children and families in one of the world\u2019s most challenging contexts. The UK\u2019s rhetoric that it supports women and girls in Afghanistan now rings hollow.\u201d More than 28 million people \u2013 more than half the population \u2013 including 15 million children, are in need of humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan, according to the UN. Since 2019, the total UK aid budget has been cut by \u00a34bn, from 0.7% gross national income (\u00a315.2bn) to 0.5% (\u00a311.4bn) in 2021. As much as a third of the aid budget is now being spent on housing refugees in the UK, which MPs on the international development committee (IDC) have described as \u201cunsustainable\u201d. The IDC had launched a parliamentary inquiry into the impact of the government\u2019s funding cuts on women and girls in low-income countries. The cut to Save the Children\u2019s programme, Supporting Afghanistan\u2019s Basic Services, comes three months after the Taliban issued a decree banning Afghan women from working for NGOs. The charity was among a number of organisations that suspended operations as a result. It has resumed its work after receiving assurances from the authorities that female staff will be safe and can work without obstruction.

All the contestants have the goods: they can sing, they can play, they can perform and have in many cases years of experience under their belts. And the judges (country singer-songwriters Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and Orville Peck), who have scouted and champion four contestants each, are there to help not humiliate them. The relief is tremendous, even if you do have to hear an awful lot about hopes, dreams, journeys and other guff. Nevermind. It\u2019s worth it, overall. The show \u2013 executive produced by Reese Witherspoon and country star Kacey Musgraves \u2013 is designed to find country singers who do not fit the traditional Nashville mould. Allen and Guyton, who are both Black, each auditioned for American Idol early in their careers but were cut before the voting rounds and have had to negotiate the intangible barriers that stood between them and mainstream success. Peck, a gay South African musician, has had his troubles within a notably conservative and white genre, too. Each of the original dozen contestants first prepares a cover of a song that \u201cmeans something\u201d to them, under the expert guidance of wunderkind producer Adam Blackstone (musical director to just about every A-list star you can think of) before performing it at The 5 Spot, one of Nashville\u2019s oldest and most steeped-in-history venues, for the judging trio. One weakness common to all reality shows that not even this high-class effort overcomes is that we don\u2019t get to see nearly enough of their expert guidance. Why not? What could be more fascinating than watching a master of his craft work with a newcomer and teach them how to be \u2026 better? We get tiny moments, such as when Blackstone steps forward to advise Justin, a charismatic South African singer and guitarist, to \u201ctake it half a step up from A minor\u201d, and they look at each other and grin in wordless recognition of the wisdom of what he has just said. How can you not want to see more and dig down into that? After the showcases (when one contestant, usually, is sent home), the remainder take part in further workshops and elimination rounds. Allen leads a collaboration session where they all have to work with each other, to teach them that no musician is an island. Guyton hosts a performance workshop with creative director Jemel McWilliams and Peck runs a visual storytelling class in which a professional production designer helps them create their own sets to reflect their particular artistry and \u2013 yes, they\u2019ve softened me up so much I\u2019m going to say it \u2013 vision.

However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has admitted that this was in fact a typo, and that the targets are for 30,000 miles altogether by 2037, and 45,000 altogether by 2050. This is significantly less than the first draft of the plan promised and about half of what the CCC recommends, which is 40% more hedgerows by 2050. Expanding hedgerows has been seen as a relatively easy win for tackling the climate and biodiversity crisis, as they quite easily fit into the farmed environment while having many benefits for carbon storage and wildlife. Half of England\u2019s hedgerows are estimated to have been ripped up since the second world war for farming purposes, and campaigners have been asking for them to be put back into the landscape. The Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: \u201cDefra should invest in a proof reader. Their accidental target was significantly better than the revised one. \u201cOnce again, the government has failed to create a meaningful plan to recover our natural environment. Their targets lack ambition and without the proper systems in place are likely to be missed entirely.\u201d Environment groups called for more ambitious targets. Tom Fyans, the interim CEO of the countryside charity CPRE, said: \u201cWe need to see at least double the level of ambition. The Climate Change Committee\u2019s recommendation was for 40% more hedgerows by 2050. We estimate that means around 100,000 miles by 2050 instead of the 45,000 miles ministers have included in the Environmental Improvement Plan \u2013 so less than half of what\u2019s needed. \u201cBut putting the target to one side, it\u2019s also important that the government turns its mind to delivery. This target isn\u2019t worth the paper it\u2019s written on without more funding and support for farmers.\u201d Barnaby Coupe, the land use policy manager for The Wildlife Trusts, added: \u201cWe desperately need to replant lost hedgerows, as well as improving the quality of those that exist today. Government funding and ambition should reflect the importance of hedgerows in creating wildlife corridors \u2013 and planning and planting of this vital habitat should be a key priority.\u201d A Defra spokesperson admitted the error and said: \u201cHedgerows are important ecological building blocks across our landscapes. Our new farming schemes will continue to invest in incentives for maintenance and planting of hedgerows across the country. \u201cWe set out our ambition in the Environment Improvement Plan that through the support of government schemes 65 to 80% of landowners and farmers will adopt nature friendly farming practices on at least 10 to 15% of their land by 2030. They will also be supported to create or restore 30,000 miles of hedgerows by 2037 and 45,000 miles of hedgerows by 2050.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-24", "section": "Environment", "author": "Helena Horton Environment reporter", "id": 71, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8224db6260c6edddc5a10744fd173f38eaeb3647/0_0_3072_1843/500.jpg"}, {"title": "UK\u2019s migration bill could put thousands of children \u2018into arms of criminals\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/mar/24/uk-migration-bill-could-thousands-children-arms-criminals", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.131, "neu": 0.597, "pos": 0.271, "compound": 0.9964}, "body": "Children\u2019s social services bosses have launched an outspoken attack on the government\u2019s illegal migration bill, warning it could lead to thousands of youngsters in care running away \u201cinto the arms\u201d of traffickers and criminals. The Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services (ADCS) in England said the proposed legislation undermined existing laws that protect children, and contradicted the government\u2019s own vision for children in care, \u201cStable Homes, Built on Love\u201d, outlined last month. \u201cIf implemented, the bill will irreversibly distort the care system. The care system is not, nor should it be, a holding mechanism for the immigration system,\u201d said Steve Crocker, the ADCS president. He added: \u201cWhen a child first comes into our care, our primary focus is to find them a permanent, stable home as set out in statute. We cannot carry out this essential work if they are to be removed as soon as they turn 18 years old despite having care leaving rights and entitlements up to 25 years. \u201cThe UN convention on the rights of the child states that in all actions concerning children, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. Sadly, this bill is a clear step away from over 30 years of custom and practice in this country.\u201d He added: \u201cAll children in this country, irrespective of where they were born, have the right to a safe and nurturing environment.\u201d The bill proposes to detain and deport asylum seekers who arrive in the UK by irregular means in small boats or in the back of lorries. Unaccompanied children will be deported when they turn 18. The Refugee Council estimates 40,000 children will be affected in the first three years if the bill becomes law. The ADCS said the statement reflected the serious concerns of local authority children\u2019s services heads about the \u201cdamaging effect\u201d the bill would have on children who had arrived in the UK having fled desperate situations. By law councils have a duty to safeguard all children in their care and ensure their needs are met. Under the Children Act 1989, for example, they are required to secure permanence for children in care. This would be impossible if, as the bill proposes, children covered by the act are deported on their 18th birthday. This cohort of migrant children would in effect become part of a two-tier care system in which they had fewer care rights than their contemporaries. It was likely to create \u201can incentive for children to run away before they turn 18 into the arms of exploiters and traffickers to avoid being returned to their home country\u201d, Crocker said. He added the lack of permanency would create \u201cunintended safeguarding risks\u201d for unaccompanied minors in local authority care, and children who are detained with their family in Home Office accommodation, for whom it was not clear where safeguarding responsibilities lay. Crocker said the bill ran counter to the government\u2019s own vision for children in care, set out with great fanfare in February in its response to the independent review of children\u2019s care. The children\u2019s care minister, Claire Coutinho, said at the time youngsters in care \u201cdeserve the same love and stability as everyone else\u201d and that \u201cmore needed to be done to protect our most vulnerable children\u201d. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the particular vulnerability of children who are often forced into making life-threatening journeys to the UK which are being facilitated by criminal gangs who have little regard for their safety. \u201cUnaccompanied children who arrive in the UK illegally will be provided with the necessary accommodation and support but they will not be able to settle in the UK once they turn 18. \u201cTaking these measures will send a clear message that children cannot be exploited and forced into crossing the Channel in small boats for the purpose of starting a new life in the UK. The only way to come to the UK for protection will be through safe and legal routes. This will take power out of the hands of the criminal gangs and protect vulnerable people, including children.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-24", "section": "Society", "author": "Patrick Butler Social policy editor", "id": 72, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a3019929a97e01afc800108336a49021e4afc0c1/0_93_1784_1070/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Karl Geary: \u2018I was writing out of confusion and horror, rage and love\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/mar/25/karl-geary-i-was-writing-out-of-confusion-and-horror-rage-and-love-juno-loves-legs", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.081, "neu": 0.681, "pos": 0.237, "compound": 0.9985}, "body": "Before making his literary debut in 2017 with Montpelier Parade, Irish-born novelist Karl Geary spent more than two decades acting and screenwriting, with credits including Coney Island Baby (starring his wife-to-be, Breaking Bad\u2019s Laura Fraser), The Burrowers and an episode of Sex and the City. (Just don\u2019t ask him about his shirtless appearance in Madonna\u2019s 1992 coffee-table tome, Sex.) Now 50, he\u2019s back with a second book, Juno Loves Legs, a piercing platonic love story whose misfit protagonists careen into young adulthood in 1980s Dublin, where he himself grew up. How did the new novel start for you? With Juno\u2019s voice and this line: \u201cDear Legs, it\u2019s not gone my way.\u201d She\u2019s a bit of a bully \u2013 she elbowed and kneed her way in, screaming to be heard. I was writing a totally different book set in New York, but once I had her voice it just flatlined on the page. Did you know any Junos and Legs growing up? I knew tons. What\u2019s curious is these are outcasts among the outcasts, right? They both feel incredibly helpless, but friendship and kindness emancipate them. Juno performs this little act of courage in the playground and Legs takes her hand, and change starts to happen. Was your education at the hands of nuns and priests as harsh as theirs? It was pretty savage actually. I was careful not to overplay those cards because it becomes caricature, but in some ways I think I was kind to the establishment. When children are treated in that way, where does that trauma go? Your first novel was also set in 1980s Dublin. Are you nostalgic for that era? I wasn\u2019t writing out of nostalgia \u2013 it\u2019s something between confusion and horror, rage and love. That was a specific moment in Ireland with the receding Catholic stronghold. There was a sense of hope, this shiny new modernity\u2026 It was quickly snatched up by globalisation and now we\u2019re living in the wake of that. We\u2019re still letting our young people down. There\u2019s a trove of homeless people outside this very nice hotel. When did you leave Dublin? I left in 1988. I was 16 and I\u2019d been out of school for a while, selling wallpaper. I had a phone number of somebody in New York that I\u2019d spoken to once who ran a bicycle messenger company in the East Village, and they said come on over. What was the East Village like back then? It was wild. A lot was going on \u2013 the crack epidemic, the Aids epidemic. But there was also this cultural explosion and it introduced me to different ways of being in the world. For a while you managed Sin-\u00e9, the venue where Jeff Buckley once performed. Did any writers step on to the stage? Allen Ginsberg performed several times. He was quiet and warm, quick to smile. I remember going to see Leonard Cohen playing in the Beacon theatre. The late Hal Willner had got tickets and came with Ginsberg. During the concert, a fan threw a book on stage for Cohen and screamed: \u201cLook at the book, Leonard, look at the book!\u201d Cohen paused, and the room went silent. \u201cI see the book,\u201d says Cohen, \u201cThe book sees me\u2026 The communion is perfect.\u201d You live in Glasgow now? After Montpelier Parade, I thought: writing novels is all I want to be doing. How do I structure my life in a way that I can do this? Glasgow is probably one of the few cities that\u2019s affordable in that way. Why do you think it took you so long to become a novelist? I wrote my first when I was 21. It was terrible. When I fell into acting, I thought that was what I was supposed to be doing. It didn\u2019t suit me at all \u2013 I\u2019m far too shy. Also, my brain is hardwired as a writer, so I was always rewriting lines, but I was very quick to discard my own instinct because of my background. I looked at the statistics recently of working-class people in the arts \u2013 it\u2019s appalling and getting worse. Both your books focus on working-class characters. When we think about prose, working-class people are used for comic effect, or as a trope. I really wanted to not do that. If you take the delicate interactions that people have in their lives, you have a chance of revealing people as people, outside of their class. You get a more tactile, almost sensuous sense of a world that\u2019s usually left out. Why did writing about a platonic love affair appeal? Sexual relationships, wonderful though they are, we understand, but when you take that out of play you get to ask more interesting questions. How do people come together if not physically, how do they stay close, how do they love? Vintage clothes shops and sewing feature plenty as well. I love vintage shops. You walk in and get that smell \u2013 it\u2019s the smell of stories, because every garment has been worn for a multitude of occasions. And sewing is very like writing. I took a course in Glasgow and made a dress. It\u2019s a dog\u2019s dinner but I\u2019m so proud of it. What kind of a reader were you as a child? I was dyslexic and didn\u2019t read as a child. I came to it late. I\u2019m very aware that I have blind spots but you learn to self-educate, you learn what turns you on. It\u2019s a good way to spend time. What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve read lately? The Copenhagen Trilogy by Tove Ditlevsen is incredible. It\u2019s exactly why you\u2019d want to read. It just speaks to you and it\u2019s all in there \u2013 life\u2019s messiness, ugliness, beauty. Also, How to Build a Boat by Elaine Feeney is gorgeous, and Fern Brady\u2019s Strong Female Character is a punch in the gut \u2013 I loved it. Tell me about a book you\u2019ve not finished. Frankenstein. I started it and I don\u2019t know what happened. It\u2019s so contemporary and brilliant and the whole history of the book is fascinating. I\u2019m still gasping to read it. What do you plan on reading next? I want to go back and read more of Chekhov\u2019s short stories. I\u2019m interested in finding a way to make stories smaller and language simpler, and Chekhov certainly leads to that. I also want to read more Anne Sexton. I\u2019ve a quote from her on my studio wall: \u201cWatch out for intellect,/ because it knows so much it knows nothing/ and leaves you hanging upside down,/ mouthing knowledge as your heart/ falls out of your mouth.\u201d \u2022 Juno Loves Legs by Karl Geary is published by Harvill Secker (\u00a318.99).

The statistics are there to convince us that many autocracies spend much more sensibly than the world\u2019s richest democracies do. A few examples: China has increased spending on education as a percentage of its gross domestic product by 75% since 1975. In 2018, 15-year-old Chinese students had the highest average scores in the world on tests for math, science and reading, followed by Singapore, Macao and Hong Kong \u2013 \u201cnone of which is a democracy\u201d. Citizens of Singapore have an average life expectancy of around 84 and an infant mortality rate of two per 1,000 \u2013 \u201cbetter than almost every democracy\u201d. Singapore achieves that good health by spending just 4% of its GDP on healthcare \u2013 versus 17% of GDP spent in the US, which gets much less impressive results. Dunst\u2019s commonsense observations include ideas like these: weak safety nets damage citizens\u2019 confidence in their governments (and therefore should be strengthened); bad healthcare systems cost more money in the long run than good ones; and investments in infrastructure repay themselves many times over. Dunst is deputy director of research and analytics at The Asia Group and an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Looking at his own country, he is heartened that Joe Biden managed to push through a $1tn infrastructure bill, but then points out that\u2019s only 1.25% of GDP, compared with the 8.5% of GDP China spent on infrastructure every year from 1992 to 2011. \u201cChina today spends more on infrastructure than the United States and Europe do combined,\u201d Dunst writes. By spending more on things that actually matter, countries that oppress their citizens in other ways can engender remarkable levels of confidence in government. \u201cIn 2019,\u201d Dunst writes, \u201cnearly 90% of Chinese reported trust in their government \u2026 as did almost 70% of Singaporeans.\u201d Practically the only good news for democracies in this story is the fact that almost every major economy faces similar declining birth rates. Most dramatically, China has gone from 2.25 children per woman in 1990 to just 1.3 today. No major economy is producing enough children to maintain its current population. At the same time, since 2017, China\u2019s net migration rate \u2013 the number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants \u2013 \u201chas worsened every year\u201d. China lost about 335,000 people in 2022 alone. Democracies like the US, Germany and the UK all posted positive net migration rates of at least 2.7%. These numbers support one of Dunst\u2019s more optimistic notions. While \u201cChina and others may promise economic stability\u201d, democracies remain attractive because they offer \u201cmore freedom, equality and opportunities to pursue happiness\u201d. Dunst argues that one of the biggest challenges for democracies is to convince their populations of the benefits of immigration, instead of listening to politicians like Donald Trump in the US and Marine Le Pen in France, who have been so successful in reviving ancient xenophobia. Dunst also thinks education systems in places like the US and Britain need to become much more democratic. At Harvard, the acceptance rate for the children of alumni is 30%, versus 6% for the general population. In 2021, \u201cnearly a third of legacy freshmen hailed from households making more than half a million dollars\u201d. When non-connected parents \u201csee the underperforming children of top financiers and politicians vaunted into top schools and jobs because of connections, these parents will rebel against the system that allowed this to happen \u2026 They will vote for the would-be dictator.\u201d Dunst thinks we must offer more scholarships \u201cfor people studying science and technology \u2026 more funding for vocational schools\u201d and \u201cconstant skill training\u201d for the workforce. He wisely suggests that a \u201ckey reform would be to make non-regular [American] workers eligible for high-quality health insurance that travels with them from job to job\u201d. But he is also bizarrely opposed to universal healthcare \u2013 the kind that is the norm all over Europe. Suddenly, he sounds like a flack for a greedy pharmaceutical company, writing that such a system \u201ccould undermine the competitive attitude that makes the United States one of the world\u2019s leaders in medical innovation\u201d. America\u2019s continuing failure to provide decent health insurance to its most needy citizens is hardly a spur to innovation. And the fact we are the only major democracy with a healthcare system dominated by the profit motive isn\u2019t mentioned here at all. Dunst is almost entirely silent about the explosion of fake facts on the internet, which makes it so much more difficult to sell the commonsense ideas he pushes for. Another problem is his failure to acknowledge that America now has only one major political party that is genuinely interested in solving any of these fundamental problems, while the other prefers to cater to its base with attacks on wokeness or any prosecutor who thinks it makes sense to prosecute a former president for any of his dozens of alleged crimes. This is the fundamental problem facing American democracy now. As long as the Republicans control the House of Representatives or any other part of the government, the chances of enacting any of the proposals Dunst thinks necessary to help defeat the dictators \u2013 serious educational reform, immigration reform and additional infrastructure projects \u2013 are exactly zero.

Nigel, a widower, told the group he was living in Winchester and working in graphic design. \u201cMary sent me a message because she was looking for a graphic designer to work on a project with her,\u201d he says. They agreed to get together for coffee to discuss it. \u201cWe met at a Costa at the edge of the M3 and ended up talking for hours,\u201d says Mary. Nigel was in awe of her. \u201cShe was so eloquent and knew her subject really well. I found her so interesting.\u201d Mary also enjoyed the fact they could laugh together. \u201cWe were pulling each other\u2019s legs. He turned up in this revolting Hawaiian shirt and we had a joke about that,\u201d she says. After he completed her graphic design project, she asked if he\u2019d consider doing the photography and design for a book she was working on. \u201cWe spent the next few months touring around the UK, doing interviews with people whose properties had been flooded,\u201d she says. \u201cThe book was designed to help people better protect their properties for the future.\u201d As they got to know each other, their friendship grew and, by the end of the year, it became clear that romance was blossoming. \u201cWe started getting closer and there was a glint in our eyes. Soon we were holding hands and going for walks together. We suddenly realised it was love,\u201d says Mary. When the pandemic hit in March, Mary went to stay with Nigel. \u201cIt was the time of my life,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cWe went for long walks and did nothing but laugh.\u201d In early 2021, they bought a house in Ledbury, not far from where Mary\u2019s five children live. \u201cNigel has two children as well, but we decided to move near my family as one of my children is severely disabled and I have young grandchildren,\u201d she says. In the summer of that year, they faced their first major challenge together when Nigel\u2019s youngest son, Mike, 26, suffered a stroke. On the same day, Mary\u2019s newborn grandson, Ethan, was scheduled for lifesaving heart surgery. \u201cIt was such a stressful time and initially we had to be in different places,\u201d says Mary. Several days later, Mike was diagnosed with a genetic heart condition and received a heart transplant. \u201cWe realised his mother must have had the same condition and that\u2019s why she died so young,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cThankfully, I had Mary by my side and we supported each other through.\u201d Nigel asked Mike if he should marry Mary. \u201cI asked him to be best man at the wedding so he would have something to look forward to and work towards.\u201d He proposed in September 2021 and, by November, both Mike and baby Ethan were well enough to attend a small, socially distanced wedding. The couple married in a manor house and invited their friends from the Archers Facebook group to watch online. \u201cWe even danced out to the Archers\u2019 theme song and Mike did an amazing speech,\u201d says Mary. As well as helping each other through family trauma, Mary says Nigel supports her in looking after her youngest son. \u201cWhen you have a child who is profoundly disabled, it can be very emotional. You can get calls at any time to say your child is being blue-lighted to a hospital or having a behavioural crisis,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can break a person, but he\u2019s always there to put his arms around me and pour me a glass of red wine.\u201d Like Mary, Nigel appreciates the relationship they\u2019ve developed. \u201cShe is so good at her job and very confident. She has a soft side as well, which I saw very early on. We are just constantly happy with each other.\u201d", "date": "2023-03-27", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Lizzie Cernik", "id": 78, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/017d92eb71dd300bd0c6d0239323de149f306a9b/0_304_1536_922/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Nothing Ear 2 review: see-through earbuds with good sound", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/27/nothing-ear-2-review-earbuds-good-sound-bluetooth-android-iphone", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.056, "neu": 0.715, "pos": 0.229, "compound": 0.9985}, "body": "The Ear 2 are the latest competitively priced earbuds from the London-based tech firm Nothing, which hopes to tempt buyers away from the Apples and Samsungs of this world with novel see-through designs and good sound. The noise-cancelling earbuds cost \u00a3129 ($149), undercutting rivals from OnePlus, Google, Samsung and Apple, while offering similar features and sound quality. They replace the outgoing Ear 1 from 2021, joining the novel \u00a399 Ear Stick earbuds. The buds have a more interesting look than most competitors, but a similar form with traditional silicone ear tips and a stalk hanging down. They fit well in my ears, staying secure and comfortable for a couple of hours at a time. Squeeze the stalk for onboard playback controls: once for pause/play, twice and thrice for track skip. Squeeze and hold to adjust noise cancelling, and double-squeeze and hold for volume. They work well, but adjusting the volume is a bit cumbersome compared with the swipe gestures you get on some rivals. The semi-transparent charging case looks cool and feels nice, but is a little bigger than the best in the market. The earbuds last four hours with noise cancelling active, and fully charge about 4.5 times via the case. The earbuds support Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, so they can connect to two devices at once, such as a phone and laptop, to automatically switch between them \u2013 a feature that is still rare in the market. Specifications Water resistance: IP54 (splash resistant) Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.3, SBC, AAC, LDHC5 Battery life: 4 hours with noise cancelling (22.5 hours with case) Earbud dimensions: 29.4 x 21.5 x 23.5mm Earbud weight: 4.5g each Driver size: 11.6mm Charging case dimensions: 55.5 x 55.5 x 22mm Charging case weight: 51.9g Case charging: USB-C, Qi wireless charging Sustainability Nothing estimates that the batteries in the earbuds and case last for at least 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity. However, they are not replaceable, ultimately making the earbuds disposable. Out-of-warranty replacement earbuds or cases are available individually for \u00a350. The earbuds contain recycled tin, but Nothing does not offer trade-in schemes in the UK, nor does it use or publish environmental impact assessments, though it does estimate the earbuds\u2019 carbon footprint at 3.1kg. Sound and noise cancelling The Ear 2 have a great, everyday listening sound that beats many at this price. They are well-rounded and can hit pretty low notes when pushed, with good separation of tones handling complex tracks well. They do a great job with many music genres, but can sometimes sound a little flat. They are an all-round improvement on their predecessors but still will not trouble the best in the business. The earbuds support hi-res audio with certain Android phones, but the difference between it at standard quality using an iPhone was marginal. The Ear 2 have active noise cancelling that, when set to maximum, did a good job of quietening the drones of engines and taking the edge off the commute, but they let through higher-pitched tones such as voices or taps on keyboards in the office. Their awareness mode is one of the better ones, sounding fairly natural for holding conversations or listening for traffic. Call quality was excellent in quiet spaces but sounded a little artificial in noisy environments, letting through only a few sudden loud noises such as car horn beeps. Price The Nothing Ear 2 cost \u00a3129 ($149). For comparison, the Nothing Ear Stick cost \u00a399, the OnePlus Buds Pro 2 cost \u00a3179, Google Pixel Buds Pro cost \u00a3179, the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 cost \u00a3279.95, and the Apple AirPods Pro 2 cost \u00a3249. Verdict The Ear 2 are a set of fairly refined Bluetooth earbuds with great everyday listening sound and a more interesting look than most rivals, particularly for their competitive price. The noise cancelling reduces the rumbles of the daily commute well enough, but struggles to compete with the best for dampening distractions such as speech. They fit well and their squeeze controls are decent, as is their voice quality for calls. Being able to connect to two devices at the same time and having a cross-platform app for both Android and iPhone is very handy. The earbuds also come up a little short on battery life: just four hours before needing a charge in the case. The biggest issue is that the battery still cannot be replaced in the earbuds or case, ultimately making them disposable and losing a star. Pros: look great, good sound, good value, reasonable noise cancelling, comfortable fit, great call quality, decent controls, Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, cross-platform app. Cons: disposable, battery life a little shorter and the case a little bigger than the best, noise cancelling struggles with higher tones, no head-tracking spatial audio support.", "date": "2023-03-27", "section": "Technology", "author": "Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor", "id": 79, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/549baddeff9749804b4abdf30960447e324f098c/796_317_4035_2421/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Please Baby Please review \u2013 Andrea Riseborough leads retro reverie of vamp and camp", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/27/please-baby-please-review-andrea-riseborough-leads-retro-reverie-of-vamp-and-camp", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.112, "neu": 0.679, "pos": 0.209, "compound": 0.9483}, "body": "A rocky-horror sexual awakening is promised in Amanda Kramer\u2019s initially interesting but ultimately laborious queer reverie of 50s and 60s style, like a theatrical daydream as experienced by Anybodys, from West Side Story. The long dissolve fades and blue-lit nightclub scenes are amusingly Lynchian, as is the very stylish and all-too-brief cameo from Demi Moore as a mysterious and worldly neighbour called Maureen. But the film feels over-determined and self-satisfied. Andrea Riseborough and Harry Melling play Suze and Arthur, a couple with liberal, bohemian tastes who live in a rough part of town and like going to beatnik poetry clubs. But passionate, slinky Suze is unsatisfied with her milksop husband Arthur; he rejects caveman masculinity and quotes Hamlet: \u201cMan delights not me, no nor woman neither \u2026\u201d (Their apartment has the Shakespearean number 2B.) Then one evening they chance across a gang of murderous delinquents, led by Brandoesque tough guy Teddy (Karl Glusman) and something in his thrillingly criminal muscularity excites Suze and Arthur. And so the curtain rises on a fantasy floorshow of vamp and camp, showcasing flourishes of sexuality and brutal violence. But where are we heading with it all and what is it telling us that we didn\u2019t know before? Suze and Arthur are already established as \u2013 respectively \u2013 sexily dominant and wimpily passive and so the big change doesn\u2019t radically subvert what we\u2019ve already been given, and Riseborough\u2019s stagey performance has been over-directed. But there is an amusing scene in which Suze sneaks into a gay soft-porn cinema (about to be raided) showing a surreal black-and-white film of two beefcake guys wrestling in a swimming pool underwater.

But now the organisation has been forced to defend its recipe in the face of claims its scones have secretly gone \u201cwoke\u201d with the introduction of a vegan recipe. Forget whether the jam tops the cream, or the other way round: it is the lack of butter that reportedly is angering some visitors. Some critics have gone public, condemning the use of vegetable spread rather than butter in the plant-based scones served in National Trust cafes. Maude Newby, 64, a longtime National Trust member from Bury St Edmunds, told the Daily Mail: \u201cI can\u2019t stand the taste of the new scones. They are not like traditional ones at all \u2013 they are flatter, drier and have an unappealing texture.\u201d Bill Cash, an MP who often has tea and scones in the House of Commons, opined to the paper: \u201cIt makes me wonder what will happen next \u2013 will they stop selling madeira cake because of historical events in Madeira?

They added: \u201cNational Trust cafes serve millions of customers a year and we work hard to accommodate dietary needs and allergies. Our scones are made with vegetable-based spread.

It is obvious in the deeply confessional books she has written: using her law degree and story of being molested as a child to explore how the law handles sexual crimes (2018\u2019s Eggshell Skull); her own eating disorder to examine body image (2019\u2019s Beauty); and her anxieties about her own intelligence driving an investigation into the sexist, racist, classist history of education (2021\u2019s Who Gets to Be Smart?). But there is also the mini empire she has built in a startlingly short time: the Walkley-nominated investigative journalism, the keynote speeches, the newsletter, the podcast, the PhD in law she is completing while also lecturing. She\u2019s the sort of cool girl author who can campaign for reforms to defamation law and sex education while also featuring in campaigns for Mimco and Camilla and Marc. She runs writing workshops for those keen enough to spend thousands on learning just how Lee does it; when we speak, she has just held one in Egypt and another in Sydney (no spots left for Sri Lanka in September \u2013 $5,000 a pop, flights not included). Oh, and last year she went to Antarctica for a month to research her next book. When people heard I was interviewing Lee, they all asked me variations of the same question: how did she do all of this, in less than a decade? And after meeting her it\u2019s clear: hard work, powered by a deeply deliberate (some would say cynical) drive to do what is needed to get exactly where she is. \u201cI think work will probably define my entire life,\u201d Lee tells me. \u201cWhen your art is so informed by your life, everything is potential material. When I\u2019m on holiday, I see or hear things that would be great to write about and I have to actually visualise letting them go. It is both my greatest asset and my greatest weakness that I almost never switch off.\u201d Rather fittingly, her latest book is titled The Work. Her first novel, it follows two young people whose lives are dominated by the crossovers in money, power and sex. There is Lally, a gallery owner in New York who is flush with cash and praise when one of her artists dies suddenly, making him very collectible. And across the world in Sydney is Pat, an art auctioneer struggling to pay his rent, who begins blurring lines with a rich client. It could all be ripped from today\u2019s headlines \u2013 the vagaries of the art world, #MeToo, cancel culture, millennials in the property market and deep fake pornography \u2013 though Lee began working on it five years ago. It will most likely storm bestseller lists. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Work was always going to be a novel for Lee, who has only written nonfiction previously. Part of the inspiration came from her own social circles: watching brilliant young people move from their 20s to their 30s, from bad share houses into bad one-bedroom apartments, and how their ability to make art was determined by \u201cwhether they had family money \u2013 or whether their debut was an unexpected success\u201d, she says drily. Neither Pat nor Lally are artists themselves, but they shape how art is seen, which is what Lee is most interested in. \u201cIt\u2019s how the sausage gets made: all the people whose jobs exist in between the artist and the person who steps into a gallery space to look at art or buys a book,\u201d she says. \u201cAll those people who invisibly shape the perception of how that art is received, priced, documented, collected, archived, remembered, elevated or lost to obscurity. And so much of that has little to do with the work. \u201cOne of the driving questions for me over the years is how to be very cynical and very clear-eyed about the creative industries, whilst staying very romantic about the art itself. And I realised, from the beginning, that what is required of me to actually make the work, versus what is required of me to sell the work, are two entirely different versions of Bri Lee.\u201d Certainly, part of Lee\u2019s success comes from her willingness to \u2013 to use her analogy \u2013 be the sausage meat. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is no personal cost to being put through the meat grinder, of getting up at festivals and on television and talking about the deepest darkest parts of oneself that she has, admittedly, chosen to sell and that the publishing industry so loves selling. \u201cI cried in front of crowds as I talked about what I\u2019d survived, and the messages started pouring in,\u201d she wrote in Beauty of her time promoting Eggshell Skull. \u201cMy inbox was screaming at me to read and reply to people\u2019s outpourings of pain. In the signing line I was asked for advice, unloaded on, praised, and questioned. There was minimal sleep, maximum drinking, and a growing feeling of being permanently on display.\u201d \u201cIt is not lost on me that the success of the book I wrote about getting molested is the reason I now enjoy artistic freedom,\u201d she says now, bluntly. \u201cThat\u2019s cooked. I have thought about it a lot, as you can imagine. And there\u2019s no way to make it make sense. \u201cThe only closure I could come to is that I really think that our human fascination with each other\u2019s pain is the best thing, and the worst thing, about us. We are moved to action and altruism, we are moved to help and change, by other people\u2019s stories. But we also have this 21st century media churn of trauma narratives and if you have some identity that has made your life more difficult, that is more appealing to the media.\u201d Does she feel that she has complete agency? \u201cI have control over the words I write,\u201d she says, carefully. \u201cI do not have control over the words other people write. I was forced to come to terms with the fact I can\u2019t control other people\u2019s perception of me.\u201d She stopped reading reviews \u201ca long time ago\u201d, as well as the \u201cnasty comments on Instagram, on Goodreads\u201d. She has a small group of people \u201cwhose opinions I value very, very highly\u201d, though she is keen to stress that she values criticism: \u201cHand on heart, it\u2019s A-OK if people don\u2019t like my work. What is much harder to stomach is the people who deliberately misrepresent my work.\u201d Lee\u2019s repeated use of her personal experience, to pick over the invisible societal and political forces that shaped that experience, rankles some as solipsistic. \u201cPerhaps Lee\u2019s true subject is self-worth,\u201d one critic wrote of Who Gets to Be Smart, in which Lee examines enormous topics like eugenics and also recalls crying after a dinner party in Oxford because she felt stupider than everyone there. It wasn\u2019t an unfair observation. But, aside from her obvious smarts, Lee\u2019s awareness that what she does can be bought, packaged and sold goes some way to explain how she arrived where she is. It may sound strange, given how much of her life has been pored over by readers, but Lee considers herself a private person. She sees a lot of parallels between artists and writers when it comes to public personas: \u201cThe thing that makes you a good artist is your ability to sit for five years at a time in your studio by yourself and just do your fucking work. And the thing that makes you good at selling that work is being the complete opposite, being someone who loves being in the limelight.\u201d \u201cI love my job,\u201d she adds. \u201cI want to write until I die. But if you want to be able to pay your rent in the 21st century as an artist, you have to be a cynic about the industry.\u201d While she always feels nervous before her books are published, this is the first time she feels no dread: \u201cWith the others, I had this sinking feeling in my stomach that is just not there any more.\u201d Is that because she doesn\u2019t have a traumatic subject? \u201cYeah. People will find things to complain about but it is just not the same. You know, the last time I went on talkback radio to talk about Who Gets to Be Smart, some woman phoned in and she\u2019d pulled over to the side of the road just to yell at me. There\u2019s just no way this book can be as much of a fucking exhausting grind of constant personal disclosure, or make people yell at me.\u201d She wonders if it will still be a problem for her fiction, which has less \u201cher\u201d in it: \u201cI believe it is impossible to make great art that everybody likes. I would rather some people adore my books and some people loathe them, than everyone go \u2018meh\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s the nightmare. \u201cThe people being shitty on the internet about me \u2013 what they don\u2019t see are the 20 versions of this manuscript and what it took to make what is in your hand now. That is years of work. \u201cI love doing it.

Set against a radiant orchestral score, the scene looks sublime. But then a dissonant note is heard in the music. Then another. Not everything is as it seems. \u201cI started from a place of not knowing anything,\u201d Hamaguchi says of his new film, which sets up a paradisal image of nature to then unsettle it. He speaks with a humility that belies his standing as one of Japan\u2019s most celebrated auteurs. It was late 2021, he recalls; his previous film, Drive My Car, had been released (and would soon be the surprise hit of awards season, walking away with the Oscar for best international feature film). The musician Eiko Ishibashi, who scored Drive My Car, asked the director if he could provide background visuals for her tour. Hamaguchi, a longtime city-dweller, visited her at her studio in the countryside. Inspiration struck as he listened to her music against the sweeping landscapes. As well as a silent work, Gift, that plays at Ishibashi\u2019s performances, Hamaguchi came away from that trip with the germ of an idea for Evil Does Not Exist. Speaking over video from Yokohama, joined by an interpreter, Hamaguchi says the film was almost an accident, something he didn\u2019t \u201cgo about making\u201d. Its title \u201cnaturally popped up in my head when I was looking at nature\u201d, he says. It struck him then that while \u201cthere is violence within nature\u201d \u2013 such as natural disasters \u2013 \u201cthat violence doesn\u2019t necessarily make us think: \u2018Oh that is evil.\u2019\u201d Although \u201cwhen it comes to human society, it can be said that evil perhaps does exist\u201d. So he started writing a script about the relationship between humanity and the natural world. The story he ended up creating feels strikingly modern, touching on evergreen concerns of gentrification, conservation and the consequences of a culture that values profit above all else. Two young workers from Tokyo arrive at a village a few hours away, and host a public meeting about their plans to set up a new glamping site for tourists from the city. They have slick marketing materials, sizeable reserves of confidence, as well as a sense that it might be OK if the village\u2019s water supply gets mixed with a bit of raw sewage. The residents disagree, instigating a slow-burning clash between city and country. Drive My Car, an adaptation of a Haruki Murakami short story about an actor grieving his wife, was hailed as a masterpiece, and catapulted the director to a new level of international success. The film received four Oscar nominations and, along with its best international film win, was the first Japanese film to be nominated for best picture. With that, though, came new anxieties. \u201cI did not know what to do next,\u201d Hamaguchi recalls. Making this new film \u201cwas a way for me to release myself from the pressure\u201d. Perhaps the fear was unfounded. Evil Does Not Exist won the Grand Jury prize at the Venice film festival and best film at London film festival. Unlike Drive My Car, the film is relatively short \u2013 106 minutes to Drive My Car\u2019s three hours \u2013 and is pitched at a more enigmatic register, as it builds up to an ending that is surprisingly ambiguous given the film\u2019s political themes. \u201cI often get asked about the message of this film,\u201d Hamaguchi says before avoiding making a statement. \u201cPeople have said that perhaps this is the most political film I\u2019ve made, but I wasn\u2019t really conscious of these things when I was making the film.\u201d Politics is instead handled on a different register. \u201cEven though words like \u2018capitalism\u2019 and \u2018the environment\u2019 seem like big problems, these things are a part of our everyday actions. I don\u2019t believe in approaching these themes as large, looming ideas, but rather as problems in our ordinary lives.\u201d As for the mysterious ending, he says \u201cthere\u2019s no way for anybody to understand everything. In our world, there are things we just do not understand. I think one of the goals of films is to distill the world in a way, so if the story has no mystery to it, then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a reflection of the world.\u201d The idea of mystery is a mainstay of Hamaguchi\u2019s films, which tell quietly observant stories about intimacies forged and foreclosed between lovers, friends and strangers. He came on the global radar in 2015 with the acclaimed Happy Hour, a five-hour epic about middle-aged women navigating unhappy marriages. The 2018 romantic drama Asako I &amp; II follows the aftermath of a ruptured affair between two young lovers, while 2021\u2019s Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy \u2013 released around the same time as Drive My Car \u2013 is an anthology of three stories loosely about lost love. To an outsider, these might look like markers of a rocketing career: an early hit followed by a litany of well-received arthouse films, before reaching record-breaking global success. But Hamaguchi had been working in the industry years before that. He had an itinerant childhood, moving around Japan every few years because of his father\u2019s civil service job, and was a fan of manga and games, \u201cthe kinds of things I could enjoy wherever I was\u201d. It wasn\u2019t a particularly artistic childhood: \u201cI would say up until my teenage years I had been thinking of life as quite boring. I didn\u2019t necessarily have something terrible happen to me but I didn\u2019t find it super fun, either.\u201d Things started getting more interesting at university in Tokyo, where he joined a film club and started going to screenings across the city. Success did not come immediately. When he graduated from university, a professor put him in touch with an alumnus who was a director in Japan\u2019s commercial film industry (which makes films with a bigger budget and crew compared with the independent world) and Hamaguchi got a job as a junior assistant director. \u201cBack then the industry was still working in their older ways. There was a sense that if you were bad at your job, you would be punished for being bad at your job\u201d \u2013 and \u201cto my superiors I was probably a bad worker\u201d. Having learned that the commercial industry was not for him, he went to graduate school and found a mentor in the celebrated director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, before finding his feet making indie documentaries. A longtime cinephile, Hamaguchi has professed admiration for classic Hollywood; Douglas Sirk\u2019s All That Heaven Allows and the Katharine Hepburn-Cary Grant romantic comedy Holiday count among his favourite films. Did Drive My Car\u2019s US success stir any interest in working in that world? \u201cI would say Hollywood today is very different from classic Hollywood,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like I have no real understanding of how today\u2019s Hollywood works.\u201d Although he is personally curious about what some sets for the biggest budget films even look like, it \u201cultimately has to be the right opportunity\u201d. More immediately, he seems to have found the freedom he sought after releasing Drive My Car. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do, it was important for me to go back to my basics,\u201d he says. While the new film will raise a lot of questions, he\u2019s characteristically keen to preserve the importance of the unknowable, for himself and for viewers. \u201cThe film does reflect a limit of my own understanding and thought,\u201d he says, echoing something he said earlier in our conversation about the importance of mystery: \u201cI think the world is full of mystery and absurdity. I don\u2019t necessarily think I will find the answers while I\u2019m alive, but it\u2019s certainly a feeling that I have about living in this world.\u201d Evil Does Not Exist is out on 5 April.", "date": "2024-04-01", "section": "Film", "author": "Rebecca Liu", "id": 84, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/53f012e5d7c32af058ab5331af08774a700d5dd7/8_7_3580_2148/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Three Women review \u2013 intimate snapshot of rural Ukraine before the invasion", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/01/three-women-review-", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.122, "neu": 0.656, "pos": 0.222, "compound": 0.9643}, "body": "Bordering Poland and Slovakia, Stuzhytsya is a remote, sleepy village situated near the Carpathian mountains in Ukraine; it literally means \u201ccold place\u201d.

Centring on the women who have stayed behind, Maksym Melnyk\u2019s documentary is an intimate exploration of the hopes, dreams and loneliness that swell in a place seemingly forgotten by the outside world. Initially observational in style, the film introduces us to a charismatic trio of women. Nelya, a biologist, sweetly lights up whenever she comes across a pile of animal excrement, rich with valuable samples for her sadly underfunded research into the ecosystem of insects. The lack of government support also plagues Maria, Stuzhytsya\u2019s only postal worker. In charge of distributing meagre pensions to the villagers, she is constantly anxious about the lack of stamps provided by the state. Such a shortage would mean a delay in welfare support, which would be catastrophic for the residents. The third of the trio is Hanna; she is more advanced in age than her neighbours and is a farmer who proclaims herself to be the saddest woman in the world. Over the course of their blossoming rapport, Hanna lovingly prepares meals for Melnyk and his crew, and, in return, they shower her with gifts for her birthday and Christmas.

The Holocaust Survivors\u2019 Foundation USA attacked Glazer\u2019s speech as \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d, hundreds of Jewish creative industry figures signed an open letter claiming he was \u201cfuel[ling] a growing anti-Jewish hatred around the world\u201d, and Son of Saul director L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes said: \u201cHe should have stayed silent.\u201d On the other hand, Glazer was supported by the likes of Piotr Cywi\u0144ski, director of the Auschwitz Memorial (who said \u201cJonathan Glazer issued a universal moral warning against dehumanisation\u201d), playwright Tony Kushner, and Jewish Voice for Peace.

My first ended two years too late; we ate away at each other\u2019s self-esteem until I left. Years followed during which my body clock was ticking, and I yearned for a family to call my own. When it finally came, that was no easy journey with a man 10 years younger than myself and unsure of parenthood, but determined to stay with me. When signs of strife and strain increased between us and he declared he did not love me, he left me with our 14-month-old son. It took some time to admit that my subsequent grief was for him as well as the loss of the \u201cfamily dream\u201d. Being a single parent compounded my grief and anxiety; at my lowest point, I could see myself in a black box, trapped and alone. A move to a rural part of town that had direct access to hills and woodland enabled me to start to rebuild my sense of self. Starting again, I wanted to shed my skin and regenerate. I became comfortable with spending long periods alone. Jade\u2019s experience resonates as I too would spend time staring at nature. Sunsets mostly, living where I do. Watching the change in light and density of scarlet streaking across a wide sky. Listening to rain lash at my window at night or bird song as light stretches into a new dawn. Feeling utterly alive again. No longer afraid, but living in my \u201csafe place\u201d, as Jade puts it. I am a very physical person, and having spent large amounts of time not exercising my sexual desire, I am happily making up for it now. I would not choose to be alone again, but I am stronger in the knowledge that I have a safe place should I need it \u2013 and, given the impermanence of all things, I will need it, and that\u2019s OK.

Last month the Guardian revealed that during a meeting in 2019 Hester had said Abbott, Britain\u2019s first black female MP, made you \u201cwant to hate all black women\u201d and that she \u201cshould be shot\u201d. These comments are now the subject of an investigation by West Yorkshire police. Hester has apologised for his remarks, which he said were \u201crude\u201d, but insisted they were not motivated by race or gender. On Wednesday, the organisers of Leeds Pride, Yorkshire\u2019s biggest celebration of LGBTQ+ life, said they were ending their sponsorship deal with Hester\u2019s company, TPP, in a stance against discrimination. The Conservative party has continued to reject calls to return more than \u00a310m it has received from Hester in the last year amid reports that it also received a further \u00a35m from the tech entrepreneur. In a statement confirming it was cutting ties with TPP, first reported by the Yorkshire Evening Post, Leeds Pride said: \u201cThis move comes after discussions with the board of directors and collaborative partners, reflecting a stand against discrimination and in support of creating an inclusive atmosphere.\u201d The paper reported disgust in the city at TPP\u2019s sponsorship of the two-day festival after the Guardian\u2019s report of Hester\u2019s remarks. It quoted one resident as saying: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely sick to my stomach that Pride are taking a company\u2019s money whose values are so diametrically opposed to the spirit of Pride and I\u2019d like to see them give back the sponsorship money and remove TPP from all Pride advertising.\u201d In its statement, Leeds Pride added: \u201cIn light of recent developments involving alleged racist comments made by the TPP\u2019s chief executive, it became imperative for Leeds Pride to reassess its association with the company. The decision to terminate the sponsorship agreement underscores the organisation\u2019s dedication to upholding the values of diversity within the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. \u201cLeeds Pride acknowledges the concerns voiced by members of the community and recognises the importance of taking steps to uphold its principles. Through this decision, Leeds Pride asserts its position as an advocate for inclusivity, striving to ensure that Pride celebrations remain a platform for equality.\u201d Hester\u2019s company has been a sponsor of Leeds Pride since 2017 and said in a post on X last month that it was \u201cProud to be supporting Leeds Pride again!\u201d at this year\u2019s two-day festival in July.

Two in five (41%) said they had no access to counsellors or occupational health specialists to support pupils with Send, and more than half (56%) were not confident that a referral for a Send assessment, diagnosis or specialist support would lead to that pupil getting the help they needed. One respondent complained of a six-year wait for support for pupils, \u201cmeaning students don\u2019t receive the help they need until too late\u201d.

Warner Brothers announced on Wednesday that The Martian screenwriter Drew Goddard will write and direct a new movie in the sci-fi action franchise for the studio. This will be the first in the cyberpunk series, which includes the 1999 original as well as The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions and The Matrix Resurrections, not to directly involve its co-creators Lana or Lilly Wachowski, though Lana is attached to executive-produce. No word yet on whether the franchise stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne-Moss, Hugo Weaving and Jada Pinkett-Smith will return. Goddard, who won an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay for The Martian in 2016, has considerable sci-fi credits, having started his writing career on the 90s show Buffy the Vampire Slayer before moving on to such shows as Angel, Alias and Lost. He is the creator of Marvel\u2019s Daredevil, which ran from 2015 to 2018 on Netflix, and an executive producer and director on NBC\u2019s beloved comedy series The Good Place. Additional screenwriting credits include Cloverfield, The Cabin in the Woods and World War Z. It was Goddard who brought the idea of another Matrix film to Warner Bros, after 2021\u2019s The Matrix Resurrection grossed a less-than-hoped-for $159m worldwide, in part due to a pandemic same-day streaming release. \u201cDrew came to Warner Bros with a new idea that we all believe would be an incredible way to continue the Matrix world, by both honoring what Lana and Lilly began over 25 years ago and offering a unique perspective based on his own love of the series and characters,\u201d said Jesse Ehrman, Warner Bros Motion Pictures president of production, in a statement. \u201cThe entire team at Warner Bros Discovery is thrilled for Drew to be making his new Matrix film, adding his vision to the cinematic canon the Wachowskis spent a quarter of a century building here at the studio.\u201d The first Matrix, starring Reeves as a computer programmer turned fighter in the cyber underworld, became a defining cultural touchstone at the turn of the millennium for its groundbreaking visual effects, mind-bending story of simulated reality and propulsive action. The film went on to gross $467m worldwide, turned Reeves into a bankable movie star and won four Oscars, for best visual effects, best editing, best sound and best sound editing. Follow-ups to the red pill didn\u2019t go quite as well; The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, released back-to-back in 2003, garnered mixed reviews and uneven audience interest. The Matrix Resurrections also received poor to mixed reviews, with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw calling it \u201ca heavy-footed reboot which doesn\u2019t offer a compelling reason for its existence other than to gouge a fourth income stream from Matrix fans\u201d. It was assumed to be the end of the franchise for a while, until Goddard stepped in. \u201cIt is not hyperbole to say The Matrix films changed both cinema and my life,\u201d said Goddard in a statement. \u201cLana and Lilly\u2019s exquisite artistry inspires me on a daily basis, and I am beyond grateful for the chance to tell stories in their world.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 3 April 2024.

It is all about Emily Maitlis\u2019s 2019 BBC Newsnight interview with Prince Andrew, challenging him about being friends with sex trafficker and abuser Jeffrey Epstein. The prince\u2019s performance was so grotesquely embarrassing that he had to forgo his royal titles and \u201cstep back\u201d from public duties, an achievement much emphasised over the closing credits, but about which audiences may now have mixed feelings, given that he is still, after all, known as Prince Andrew and still unrepentantly prominent on royal occasions. Rufus Sewell in heavy prosthetic makeup plays the pompous HRH, a puffy-faced babyish poltroon whose smug smile is that of someone accustomed to having his every lame or boorish joke greeted with gales of laughter, and every boneheaded observation rewarded with a solemn courtier\u2019s nod. But that normally estimable performer Gillian Anderson goes into a peculiar Maggie Thatcher-lite mode to play Maitlis \u2013 all gimlet-eyed forensic alertness and unrelaxed eccentricity as she brings her dog into the office. In the supporting roles, Billie Piper plays tough producer Sam McAlister who landed the interview, trusting her fierce journalistic instincts in the face of her colleagues\u2019 prissy squeamishness and highmindedness, and Keeley Hawes plays Andrew\u2019s long-serving, discreet and loyal private secretary Amanda Thirsk who is sufficiently amiable and unstuffy with Sam to have a private drink with her in a hotel bar with no other flunkies present, and entertain Sam\u2019s notion of a candid TV interview. Something in the movie\u2019s body language seems to suggest an important kind of female solidarity here, and yet, whatever she thought in private, Thirsk isn\u2019t shown caring or commenting about Epstein\u2019s victims, and she appears to believe in Andrew\u2019s innocence. There is a male media adviser who is shown as very uptight and disapproving about this whole interview idea \u2013 and he, on the basic level of PR, is of course proved right. And yet his exclusion from the discussion process sheds no light on what Palace officials believed about Andrew\u2019s behaviour. The big moment happens \u2013 interestingly \u2013 off camera, when Andrew asks \u201cmummy\u201d if he should do the interview, and returns with the news that Her Majesty \u201ctrusts his judgment\u201d \u2013 the Queen evidently joining Amanda Thirsk among the indulgent women in Andrew\u2019s life who made that calamitous mistake. The resulting interview itself is apparently considered important enough to have a second feature-drama treatment about it in development called A Very Royal Scandal. Even Frost/Nixon only got one film and the Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales only merited a single episode on The Crown. And despite the title \u2026 well, was it a scoop, exactly? It was certainly a terrific coup and an unmissable bit of limo-crash television. But a \u201cscoop\u201d? All the factual elements had been established by other people, significantly by photographer Jae Donnelly (played in a prologue sequence by Connor Swindells) who took the famous picture of Andrew in New York\u2019s Central Park with Epstein. The interview itself, though vividly and valuably showing us the mindset of a member of the ruling class, and showing us how outrageously stupid and entitled Andrew is (which we knew already), didn\u2019t get Andrew to concede anything explicitly. There is one spark: when Prince Andrew is shown humiliating a female underling for mishandling his collection of soft toys. It\u2019s a flash of black-comic horror and Sewell has something to get his teeth into as an actor. Otherwise, the drama is smothered by its own overwhelming sense of importance. \u2022 Scoop is available on Netflix from 5 April", "date": "2024-04-04", "section": "Film", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "id": 96, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/79e8a2aa9986c095de0e2aaabbcaff8089b9877f/0_44_3000_1800/500.jpg"}, {"title": "A pep talk on peptides: they\u2019re great for skin, but don\u2019t expect \u2018Botox in a bottle\u2019 | Sali Hughes on beauty", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/apr/05/peptides-help-with-good-looking-skin-but-dont-expect-botox-in-a-bottle", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.03, "neu": 0.679, "pos": 0.291, "compound": 0.9961}, "body": "My heart gladdens when an established and evidenced skincare ingredient catches fire in an industry full of dubious claims and silly, marketing-driven trends. In a world of oxygen-boosts, diamond dust and Boswelox, be more peptide and you will finally get your moment. Peptides are everywhere and it\u2019s high time, since they are endlessly supportive of good-looking skin. Peptides are short or long chains of amino acids, occur naturally in the body, and are commonly referred to as \u201cthe building blocks of skin\u201d. But it\u2019s maybe more helpful to think of them as triggers for proteins such as elastin and collagen. There are four main types of peptide, with different functions, and hundreds of ingredients across all four, but the one with the most buzz around it is hexapeptide-8, which marketeers are annoyingly and irresponsibly describing as \u201cBotox in a bottle\u201d, because there is encouraging evidence to suggest hexapeptide-8 reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles, and boosts collagen. I\u2019ve spoken to a number of dermatologists about the ingredient, and all are cautiously optimistic and in favour of its use, but no one believes peptides are enough on their own, which is why they should be included in a broader skincare routine containing other dependable ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and retinoids. Medik8\u2019s popular Liquid Peptides (\u00a355) is a solid 30% blend of several peptides (including hexapeptide-8) in a hyaluronic acid-rich serum. It goes on after cleansing, morning and/or night, and its texture is sublime. It has a noticeable effect on the feel and \u201cbounce\u201d of my skin and is suitable for even acne- or rosacea-prone users.

It has an instantly soothing, comforting feel and is so moisturising that it can still be felt on my usually parched face in the morning.

After handing us three deeply average (at best) sequels to the majestic original 1999 film, studio Warner Bros has decided to hand the keys of the Nebuchadnezzar to Drew Goddard, whose writing credits include The Martian, The Cabin in the Woods, and Cloverfield. It\u2019s probably a good idea, because the series\u2019 creators, Lana and Lilly Wachowski, have clearly run out of ideas if 2021\u2019s completely superfluous The Matrix Resurrections is anything to go by (although to be fair, Lilly did not even get involved in that one). Resurrections joined the ranks of belated sequels to science fiction and fantasy totems that never quite live up to the standards of the original, yet somehow still keep coming. Next year we are due a new Tron movie, Tron: Ares, which will star Jared Leto, Gillian Anderson, Evan Peters and Greta Lee. These are all actors who have done fine work, and director Joachim R\u00f8nning is an Oscar nominee who made a passable effort on 2017\u2019s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, yet there is at least a 50% chance the movie will carry all the cultural weight of a new Lighthouse Family album. There is also a new Alien movie in the works, which does at least look promising. And it can only be so long before somebody in LA drags Arnie out of retirement for one last Terminator retread. How many times have we seen these films enter the limelight with a flurry of promotional activity, raising the desperate hopes of ravening fans before the inevitable bad reviews kick in and the unfortunate entry slips sheepishly through the back door of the Odeon fire escape, never to be seen again? Terminators three, four and five (six was OK); Alien vs Predator; Prometheus; nearly every movie with Star Wars in the title since the original trilogy \u2026 I feel as if I have spent half my life hoping these episodes would recapture the wonder of the films that inspired them in the first place, only to be disappointed when it becomes clear something is missing. It\u2019s the hope that kills you. And yet every few years, a sequel comes along that bucks the trend: a Prey or Blade Runner 2049, which opens up the creative architecture and makes us believe again. And this is the best we can look forward to, because unwanted new follow-ups to genre classics will seemingly always keep coming, for the same reason that each a brand of McDonald\u2019s or Burger King is much less likely to fail than the wonderful new independent bistro that just opened up down the road. Perhaps, if we\u2019re lucky enough, the new Matrix movie will be one of these outliers. Goddard is at the very least an ideas man, rather than the kind of hired Hollywood hand who often taking charge of these sequels. And that is clearly what the project needs. The world imagined by the Wachowskis in 1999 was an endlessly open creative sandbox, but clearly it needs a major revamp if it is to have any credibility a quarter of a century on. Goddard\u2019s first task is to work out exactly what the essence of The Matrix is. Is it the screen chemistry between Keanu Reeves\u2019s Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss\u2019s Trinity? Evidence from the lukewarm reaction to Resurrections would suggest not. And yet if Goddard junks the original cast entirely in favour of all-new adventures in the real and digital futures, how does he do so without basically writing off the last three movies? We were always told Neo might not be \u201cThe One\u201d, but if it turns out he actually isn\u2019t, then a hell of a lot of screen time would seem to have been wasted. Perhaps the film-maker could pull an old Hollywood trick and bring back the one Matrix alumnus who didn\u2019t make it into the most recent sequel: Laurence Fishburne. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who replaced the venerable actor as a younger version of Morpheus, failed to capture the imagination, and if Goddard does plan to feed off nostalgia, there is no one better to capture the spirit of the original 1999 entry. On the other hand, Resurrections\u2019 failure to resonate with audiences hints that if there really is anything left to be harvested from this aching old sci-fi franchise, it is probably not more glossy-eyed nostalgia. If we\u2019re really going to get excited about taking the red pill once again, the director might be better off choosing a different rabbit hole altogether this time around.", "date": "2024-04-05", "section": "Film", "author": "Ben Child", "id": 98, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/26073cebb66ac01be4146ad69c71615fb92a1471/360_156_2614_1569/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Mark Kermode on\u2026 C\u00e9line Sciamma, the auteur who finds the universal in the unique", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/06/mark-kermode-on-celine-sciamma-the-auteur-who-finds-the-universal-in-the-unique", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.073, "neu": 0.727, "pos": 0.201, "compound": 0.9976}, "body": "\u201cDoes French film-maker C\u00e9line Sciamma ever put a foot wrong?\u201d That\u2019s a question I posed in my 2021 Observer review of Petite Maman, a sublime modern fable in which a young girl meets her soulmate \u2013 a mirror-image child who appears to be a young incarnation of her mother. The film is an astonishing work, a U-certificate masterpiece for children of all ages, conjuring a magical reality in which characters converse across generational divides in disarmingly matter-of-fact fashion. The time-travelling setup may be fantastical, but there\u2019s nothing fanciful or far-fetched about the emotions the film provokes. On the contrary, Sciamma adopts the magical elements of ghost stories and fairytales to create a down-to-earth coming-of-age parable notable for just how real it feels. That sense of universal \u201creality\u201d is the key to what makes Sciamma\u2019s films so special. Looking back over my various Observer verdicts on Sciamma\u2019s movies, dating back to 2014\u2019s Girlhood (Bande de filles), which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, I realise that I never gave any of her filmsless than a five-star rave. From Claude Barras\u2019s Oscar-nominated 2016 French-Swiss stop-motion animation My Life As a Courgette, which earned Sciamma a screenwriting C\u00e9sar, to the mesmerising Queer Palm-winning period drama Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019), Sciamma\u2019s track record is pretty much flawless. I honestly cannot think of another contemporary film-maker whose work has proved so thrillingly versatile, yet so reliably perfect. Girlhood premiered at Cannes in May 2014, winning plaudits for its authentic and empathetic portrayal of a young black woman and her friends living the \u201cbanlieue life\u201d in the housing projects of Paris. Sciamma called it the climax of an \u201caccidental trilogy of youth\u201d, making good on the coming-of-age promises of 2007\u2019s Water Lilies, which my Observer predecessor Philip French called \u201calmost ethereally beautiful\u201d, and 2011\u2019s Tomboy, an international festival hit. \u201cWith her first two films,\u201d wrote my Observer successor, Wendy Ide, \u201cC\u00e9line Sciamma established herself as an accomplished young film-maker with something to say and a distinctive way of articulating it. Her third film, Girlhood, confirms her as quite simply one of the best directors of her generation.\u201d \u201cFrench young women today are this girl,\u201d Sciamma boldly declared of Marieme, the chameleon-like character at the centre of Girlhood, played vibrantly by screen newcomer (and C\u00e9sar nominee) Karidja Tour\u00e9, one of the director\u2019s many street-cast discoveries. Some balked at Sciamma\u2019s claims of universality \u2013 how could this unknown young black woman represent them? Yet Girlhood provides a perfect example of a quality that runs throughout Sciamma\u2019s filmography; the ability to strike an accessible chord by focusing tightly on specifics, finding the universal within the unique. Whether her films are centred on a gender-fluid 10-year-old or an 18th-century lesbian couple, Sciamma makes the viewer feel that the story is somehow about them, whoever they may be. Born in November 1978, and raised in Cergy-Pontoise, to the north-west of Paris, Sciamma fell in love with movies as a teenager, fired partly by her grandmother\u2019s passion for old Hollywood \u2013 a fondness for Fred Astaire musicals and Jimmy Stewart dramas. \u201cI owe a lot to American cinema,\u201d Sciamma told Time Out in 2013, citing Tootsie, Victor/Victoria and \u201cgangster films\u201d as surprising sources of inspiration. After completing a degree in French literature, she attended the French film school La F\u00e9mis, where she wrote the script for Water Lilies as her final-year project. At first, Sciamma thought she might become a screenwriter, or a critic, since directing seemed to be a male-dominated profession. But when actor/director Xavier Beauvois (who was heading the evaluation committee at La F\u00e9mis) read Water Lilies, he \u201cbegged me to make it into a film\u201d, and Sciamma found herself in the director\u2019s chair. Since then, she has proved herself to be a natural-born film-maker \u2013 an auteur who uses the medium of cinema to find common ground between apparently disparate audiences. In the process, she has helped rewrite the grammar of popular cinema itself. \u201cWhat would [the founder of Studio Ghibli Hayao] Miyazaki do?\u201d was apparently the question Sciamma asked herself when making Petite Maman \u2013 a question that speaks volumes about the \u201carthouse cinema\u201d label with which she has periodically been saddled. Make no mistake; Sciamma is \u201can artist\u201d \u2013 a purveyor of some of the most groundbreakingly adventurous works that modern cinema has to offer. But more importantly she is a communicator, making films that speak eloquently to audiences young and old, around the world. \u201cIf you want to send a message,\u201d runs an oft-quoted Hollywood canard, \u201cuse Western Union.\u201d For Sciamma, the message has always been in the movies. What else I\u2019m enjoying Late Night With the Devil This Ghostwatch-style retro horror yarn, starring David Dastmalchian, got a big thumbs-up from genre maestro Stephen King and it\u2019s easy to see why. Its evocation of a cheesy late-night TV host making diabolical decisions in search of ratings is smart, satirical and (at times) surprisingly squishy. Think \u201cAlan Partridge Goes to Hell\u201d. Devilishly good fun! The Woman in Me Britney Spears\u2019s impressively down-to-earth account of the \u201cconservatorship\u201d that effectively imprisoned her for more than a decade (prompting the \u201cFreeBritney\u201d hashtag) is lent emotional oomph by Michelle Williams who reads the audiobook.

It\u2019s weird to think it wasn\u2019t recognised until that point. Working on Four Lions with Chris Morris was a great lesson in irreverence. Even if people insist you take things seriously, you don\u2019t have to. Actually, it\u2019s probably more important not to. Comedy can take the teeth out of even the most serious issues. I only started acting because my mum wanted me to pronounce my \u201cT\u201ds properly. When I was seven, she took me to speech and drama lessons. She thought it would be elocution.

It has the ability to make sense of the world. It\u2019s the engine that keeps me running. An immigrant\u2019s journey and the pursuit of art are the same endeavour. You\u2019re walking into an open space where you can take a level of authorship over your life. What pushes you forward is your faith in the world being better. My parents came to the UK from Pakistan and Kenya. They taught me to keep going and never give up. I\u2019d like to look more awake. My wife has this running joke: she asks me to look sleepy, then to open my eyes really wide. I look exactly the same. She finds it hilarious. Hollywood stars have the ability to make or break somebody\u2019s day. I worked with Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler on the Murder Mystery films. They\u2019re both lovely, kind people and aware that they have this strange effect on people. There\u2019s an intake of breath, but somehow they ensure the conversation ends with you feeling a little bit better. Parenthood makes things feel more vital. Since having our two sons, I\u2019m much more appreciative of life. You feel grateful for even the smallest things. It\u2019s a gift. I would have been an idealistic lawyer.

He has a plum gig, presumably commissioned on the strength of the terrible joke in his show\u2019s title, rather than his sparse interviewing style or deathless addiction to boogie-woogie piano. \u201cI love classical music like I love the blues and jazz,\u201d says Jools Holland at the start of Earlier\u2026 With Jools Holland, sounding like a parent protesting that he doesn\u2019t have a favourite child. His 60 minutes mixes obvious classical bangers (hello, beautiful Bach cello suite) with Nina Simone, Janet Baker and Meredith Monk, but his brief links add little to the mix. He also improvises with guest violinist Anna Phoebe, but his jaunty musical personality is subdued; his native south-east London accent notably dialled down. Radio 3\u2019s spring rebrand, by new controller Sam Jackson, is oddly backwards-looking, its tone mollifying, wallpapery, posh; a kind of mood music for perusing private school prospectuses in one\u2019s second home. New shows include Radio 2 import Friday Night Is Music Night, which has run since 1953, featuring \u201can eclectic mix of light music\u201d (its first edition is presented by Proms regular Katie Derham), and Saturday Morning, hosted by the sprightly Tom Service (who although excellent is one of two white middle-aged men, alongside Private Passions\u2019 Michael Berkeley, hosting the only meaty, conversational programmes on the station). Music Matters was a great weekly 45-minute show of chunky journalism hosted by a mix of male and female presenters, but is now the name for a very different strand of multi-part documentaries. The first involves six hour-long episodes by Times classical critic Richard Morrison on the setlist of the king\u2019s coronation 11 yawning months ago, which apparently tells us something crucial about music right now. Episode one hints tantalisingly at challenging the system. It includes prominent voices of women and people of colour, and Morrison describing the day\u2019s \u201cfabulous feast of pageantry\u201d happening against the cost of living crisis. Brass composer Gavin Higgins, meanwhile, bemoans \u201cstill having to scream at politicians\u201d about the importance of music education and funding. But these statements are placed like impressionistic paint strokes, not even vaguely interrogated. The show loses interest. Here\u2019s 10 minutes of Handel\u2019s Zadok the Priest to console us instead. Who is this new Radio 3 for? Not eager listeners who want to broaden their horizons, I reckon, but box tickers behind the scenes, keen to poach the Classic FM or Scala crowds who are already well served. As a middle-aged music fan for whom Radio 3 has become an exciting point of entry in recent years, this rankles. I loved Saturday\u2019s airy, expansive Inside Music, where a non-household name musician shared their influences for two brain-nourishing hours, and Corey Mwamba\u2019s excellent Freeness, a show about improvisation that offered leaps into fresh worlds every week. Both are now gone. So I\u2019ll cling on to Hannah Peel\u2019s mixes on Night Tracks (week nights at 10pm), the sparkling cleverness of Kate Molleson on Composer of the Week (week days, 4pm) and the New Music Show (Saturday, 10.30pm), and Soweto Kinch\u2019s new five-times-a-week jazz show \u2019Round Midnight, although it\u2019s not exactly a radical fresh offering \u2013 Kinch\u2019s previous weeknight show, Jazz Now, was cancelled in 2019. No matter: last week he introduced me to Leeds ensemble Ancient Infinity Orchestra and an amazing track by Oumou Sangar\u00e9, chosen by 2021 Mercury Prize nominee Nubya Garcia. But I still sense that, like Jools, Kinch has been schooled to be soothing, not stirring, say little between songs. It\u2019s maddening. Controllers should treat music as a skyrocket to new places, not a sedative. Over on Radio 4 (where, incidentally, Radio 3\u2019s speech programmes Free Thinking and The Verb have been shunted) is an intriguing new series, Helen Lewis Has Left the Chat. Its premise is lively \u2013 an exploration of how the messy worlds of private messaging have shaped our identities and interactions \u2013 but this introductory episode feels frothy and scattergun, full of pastiched electronic pop interludes, random anecdotes and Lewis punctuating the tension by saying things such as \u201cuh-oh\u201d, as if we\u2019re overhearing a Teletubbies rerun. Next week\u2019s episode on politics (which I\u2019ve heard on preview) is better, based around an interview with the notorious overlord of WhatsAppery, Dominic Cummings. I enjoyed some things last week, honestly. There\u2019s Strike, BBC Cymru Wales\u2019 series about the miners in the mid-1980s, a subject already well excavated elsewhere this year, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun. It\u2019s expanded here by Welsh film director Jonny Owen (pop fact: he\u2019s also Mr Vicky McClure), who goes back to his Merthyr Tydfil living room to chat with his mates and mam; his father quit mining after helping to dig out the dead from Aberfan. Interviewing friends and people from his parents\u2019 generation, Owen makes this history feel powerfully recent and explores the terrifying camaraderie of the pit brilliantly, every clank and echo of the coalface ringing in our ears. A pick-me-up after all that is the glorious first episode of season two of Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s Wiser Than Me (Lemonada). As well as the wonderful story of how she joined Seinfeld and made the masturbation episode, The Contest, she gets her guest Sally Field ranting about crumbling cartilage and misogyny in movies (\u201cevery single solitary year was such a goddamn fucking struggle\u201d). Dreyfus is a warm, non-sycophantic host, as brashly funny as her old Seinfeld character, Elaine Benes.

Fish has reported on the state party sending out a pro-Trump mailer in the district that attacked his primary opponent in the race. Williams was elected party chair in 2023 after supporting conspiracy theories that Trump won the 2020 election, and he introduced a resolution in the state house in 2022 to thank a state representative and others who participated in the January 6 insurrection.

In its first planning update since 2017, ShapingSEQ (the South East Queensland Regional Plan) has tasked the region with providing almost 900,000 new homes and about 1m new jobs by 2046. The ShapingSEQ 2023 website says: \u201cEvery SEQ resident should have access to a safe, secure and affordable home that meets their needs and enables participation in the social and economic life of this prosperous state.\u201d Those living and working in the region \u2013 or hoping to in the future \u2013 have a rapidly increasing need for more housing and different types of housing, improved infrastructure and employment opportunities. The plan \u2013 available to read online \u2013 sets a long-term vision for the region. It outlines proposed strategies and interventions for more efficient land use that will support rapid population growth. So, how does this look in practice? Building a future that meets fast-changing needs Over the past 20 years, SEQ has grown consistently by an average of 2.2% per year. Today SEQ is home to about 3.8 million people, up from 2.4 million in 2001. However, the government acknowledges that future growth will look significantly different from past growth, \u201cpresenting challenges and opportunities of a complexity beyond those faced by the region to date\u201d. Among these, it notes increasing fiscal uncertainty, pressures relating to housing affordability and accessibility, and the need to quickly adjust to meet changing needs as the population expands. The plan\u2019s priorities reflect the challenges of having an expanding population with diverse needs. For example, SEQ has a growing number of single-person households, a decline in families with dependent children, but more extended families living together and an increase in couple-only families. Importantly, ShapingSEQ also addresses a major reason for the population explosion: the lifestyle, community and environment that make SEQ an attractive place to live. While accommodating future growth, the 2023 plan also intends to \u201csustainably enhance and maintain\u201d the appeal of the region. A focus on housing availability and choice in urban growth To meet housing needs, SEQ will need to provide a mix of traditional, single block, detached Queenslanders, and attached homes, such as townhouses, apartments, terrace houses and small lot houses. The ShapingSEQ plan recognises that the solution isn\u2019t as simple as building more houses \u2013 they must be fit for purpose, recognising the diversity of family structures, and the need for access to employment, services and amenities, connected by appropriate infrastructure. Households in SEQ are increasingly smaller and more diverse, signalling a change in the type of housing needed to support the population and its preferences. The government says there is growing demand for attached housing. Different proposed housing types, models and higher densities are planned in well-located and well-serviced areas. The government also intends to \u201cunlock new models and diverse forms of homes\u201d for sustainable growth, including build-to-rent, co-housing and micro-housing. Creating a SEQ that caters to everyone The plan identifies that the creation of new housing alone is a false benefit if it doesn\u2019t also make it possible to get to work, school and other essential locations. ShapingSEQ focuses on ensuring \u201cpeople who work in key roles in our community\u201d can access affordable housing options close to where they work, while identifying necessary changes to transport mode priorities, including prioritising more sustainable options such as through promoting investment in \u201cactive transport infrastructure, public transport enhancements and innovative mobility services\u201d. The plan also includes a high amenity areas framework that supports collaboration between government agencies, infrastructure providers and local councils, to align both existing and planned infrastructure with growth and changing land use. As part of the application of this framework, stakeholders will work together to ascertain where additional population growth can be supported. Aligning transport infrastructure with planned density and dwelling growth will result in an increased emphasis on improvements to streets, roads and stations, alongside more investment in local facilities and amenities to encourage communities to live, work and play close to home. A home for every South East Queenslander Effective support for a growing population must address issues of housing inequity for more at-risk members of the community. ShapingSEQ sets a combined social housing and affordable housing target that it says would support housing availability for vulnerable people, those on low and moderate incomes, and essential workers. Houses provided as part of this target will be made up of non-market housing \u2013 subsidised housing that\u2019s sold or rented at less than market value \u2013 and market housing, such as not-for-profit developments and lower-cost options. In addition to the above targets, the plan also sets housing diversity sub-targets to promote different forms of housing being built across the region. These targets are set at a more granular level for each local government area (LGA), to encourage appropriate diversity in housing types that consider local residents\u2019 needs. The plan also calls for increased access to safe housing choices for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. With a wide spectrum of housing planned, ShapingSEQ reflects the aspiration that \u201cdone well, growth is an opportunity to expand and enhance our already great communities and support the different needs and lifestyles of all Queenslanders\u201d. ShapingSEQ Regional Plan priorities A sustainable growth pattern. More homes, faster \u2013 supply, diversity and affordability. More social and affordable homes. Well-designed communities. Integrating land use and infrastructure. New economic opportunities and jobs. A sufficient pipeline of industrial land. Incorporating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander knowledge, culture, traditions and aspirations. Regional approach to natural hazards. Better biodiversity outcomes for growth areas.

The new full, flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) rises from \u00a3203.85 to \u00a3221.20 a week \u2013 or \u00a311,500 a year. The old basic state pension paid to those who reached state pension age before April 2016 rises from \u00a3156.20 a week to \u00a3169.50 a week \u2013 equivalent to a more than \u00a3600 annual increase to \u00a38,814. I\u2019m on the lower, older pension. What help can I get? Poorer pensioners on the basic rate may qualify for pension credit, which has also increased. The means-tested benefit is there to top up pensioners\u2019 weekly income to \u00a3218.15 if they are single \u2013 up from \u00a3201.05 a week. Couples receive \u00a3332.95 a week, up from \u00a3306.85. Anyone who qualifies for pension credit may also be entitled to other financial support, including cost of living payments, housing benefit, a reduction in council tax, or help with heating costs through the warm home discount scheme. People born before 25 September 1957 are also entitled to the annual winter fuel payment. What about other benefits? Because those on other benefits don\u2019t enjoy the benefits of the triple lock, their increases are limited to 6.7% this year \u2013 as calculated by the increase to CPI last September. Universal credit, claimed by about 6 million people in the UK, is the big beast of the benefits world and is given to workers on low incomes as well as those who are out of work. For single people, the basic UC payments rise to \u00a3311.68 a month (up from \u00a3292.11) for the under-25s. For those 25 or over, it is now worth \u00a3393.45 a month (up from \u00a3368.74). Couples who are both under 25 now receive \u00a3489.23 a month \u2013 up from \u00a3458.51, while older joint claimants where one or both are 25 or over get \u00a3617.60 a month (up from \u00a3578.82) The various other elements of UC, for example the top-up paid to those with children \u2013 plus a host of other benefits \u2013 all rise by 6.7%, too. These include personal independence payments, disability living allowance, attendance allowance and incapacity benefit. Child benefit Parents now receive \u00a3102.40 every four weeks (\u00a325.60 a week) or \u00a31,331 a year for the first or only child, and \u00a367.80 every four weeks (\u00a316.95 a week) for each additional child \u2013 \u00a3881 a year. The classic two-child family now receives \u00a32,214 a year in child benefit \u2013 an increase of \u00a3137.80 a year compared with last year. From 6 April 2024, families where the highest earner has a salary of up to \u00a360,000 a year will not be subject to the high income child benefit charge. Previously, a person who had an annual income of \u00a350,000 or more would be liable to pay the charge if they or their partner were receiving child benefit. The change means several hundred thousand families will be better off, some to the tune of up to \u00a33,000 a year. What is the state pension age and when can I retire? More than 12 million people currently receive the state pension. Men and women born between 6 October 1954 and 5 April 1960 start receiving their pension at the age of 66. But for people born after this date, the state pension age has been increasing to 67 for those born on or after 5 April 1960. The plan is to introduce a gradual rise to 68 between 2044 and 2046 for those born on or after 5 April 1977. Will the triple lock continue? In March the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said the Conservatives would continue the triple-lock system, if they won the next general election. Labour has also said it is \u201ccommitted to retaining\u201d the triple lock. The triple lock was temporarily suspended for the 2022-23 tax year after the Covid pandemic distorted average wage figures, but later restored.", "date": "2024-04-08", "section": "Money", "author": "Miles Brignall", "id": 105, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ab68634408994b9a83856c8605554e157391540b/0_31_3000_1801/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Distinguished jumping spider \u2013 an arachnid that\u2019s not just a pretty face", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/08/distinguished-jumping-spider-an-arachnid-thats-not-just-a-pretty-face", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.07, "neu": 0.695, "pos": 0.235, "compound": 0.9947}, "body": "The eyes have it. If you\u2019re a sucker for a charismatic gaze, an impressive name and great rarity, then the distinguished jumping spider should get your vote. But this acrobatic, spectacular-looking tiny spider with two large black forward-facing eyes is not merely a pretty face. It is a powerful environmentalist and mighty representative of the value of often-derided, seemingly desolate post-industrial landscapes. The spider was only discovered in Britain in 2003 and is today only found in two locations: West Thurrock marshes and Swanscombe peninsula. Both are \u201cbrownfield\u201d sites in the Thames Gateway, the largest area designated for new development in Europe. Politicians from both right and left are queueing up to build on brownfield because it seems \u2013 and sounds \u2013 so much better to place new buildings on the footprint of old rather than concrete over the luscious greenbelt. But life isn\u2019t that simple, and most brownfield sites, particularly those in the warm, dry south-east, are far more biodiverse than farmers\u2019 fields. Some are the most biodiverse sanctuaries in the land. The abandoned oil refinery at Canvey Wick, for instance, is home to nearly 2,000 invertebrate species. Many thrive because the old concrete and rubble create dry, sheltered and warm microclimates where species at the northern edge of their natural range can thrive. The distinguished jumping spider is one such denizen of the rubble, liking old coal heaps and dry and salty terrain where relatively few plants survive. Its name was given during a Victorian dispute over similar species. Like the other 37 jumping spider species found in Britain, it does not spin webs but uses its excellent eyesight (the best of any invertebrate except for cephalopods) and ability to leap 10 times its body length to catch prey. The male of the species also uses its keen eyes to assess the receptiveness of females during their mating dance, and making a quick exit to avoid getting eaten if his dance does not go down well. The spider has been at the forefront of opposition to ambitious plans to build Britain\u2019s \u201cDisneyland\u201d on Swanscombe peninsula and although plans have been withdrawn, the spider\u2019s home and site of special scientific interest (SSSI) is still earmarked for development. So vote distinguished, vote for treasuring our smallest creatures, and vote for leaving some brownfield sites alone. The spider\u2019s success shows that our restless abandonment of yesterday\u2019s industries opens up niches that wild nature is always ready to rapidly exploit. Which is well worth celebrating.

The next chair had to be a nuts-and-bolts operator with recent frontline retail experience, almost everybody agreed, and the employee-owned group has landed someone who fits the bill. Jason Tarry spent 33 years at Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest retailer by a distance, and is regarded as having put in a successful six-year shift as head of its UK and Irish operations until he quit last autumn. He was there for the fightback after the 2014 accounting scandal, and was in charge during the wild Covid times for supermarkets. Tarry, say those who know him, is the cuddlier type of ex-Tesco executive (they can exist), which may help in negotiating the partnership\u2019s internal politics and democracy. But, on the safe assumption that you don\u2019t survive as boss of the most important bit of the Tesco empire unless you keep the place brutally competitive, John Lewis couldn\u2019t have done much better on the hiring front. A competitive edge is what the partnership needs after three years of losses and only a small profit last year. The game for the next few years is about the grind of supply chain efficiencies and investment in IT, analytics and customer service. Tarry, like the incumbent, Dame Sharon White, will be a full-time chair, so there\u2019s an obvious question of where Nish Kankiwala, the chief executive, fits. Giving him the job title a year ago, the first time it has been used at the partnership, made sense if White was to be followed by a non-executive chairman, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Will Kankiwala now become more of a chief operating officer? \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with the board, Nish and the executive team,\u201d said Tarry blandly in his pre-written statement. One assumes the two men have some sort of understanding on their different roles, but that doesn\u2019t guarantee it will work in practice. Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s experiment in having a chief executive and co-chief executive didn\u2019t last long. The more interesting detail in the statement was Tarry\u2019s description of the partnership\u2019s strategy as \u201cclear\u201d. And, yes, it\u2019s definitely clearer since a month ago when White ditched the target of generating 40% of profits from non-retailing activities by 2030. The next question, though, is whether John Lewis, at whatever pace, still wants to build and own a portfolio of 10,000 buy-to-rent flats? Tesco\u2019s recent experience, note, has been about concentrating on its core business and keeping extracurricular adventures to a minimum. That may be part of the reason why it is successful. At least the build-to-rent distraction isn\u2019t pressing. The priority is ensuring retail discipline in the stores and online, which, to be fair to White and Kankiwala, improved in the past year. History may also be kinder to White than the current reviews: she inherited an overexpanded business with little spare cash five years ago and is handing over an operation that can afford to boost investment to \u00a3542m this year, a 70% uplift from last year\u2019s pauper\u2019s ration. But, when your most recent annual profits were \u00a356m, and your definition of a \u201csustainable\u201d return is \u00a3400m, it makes complete sense to hire a lifer from the top retailing academy.

His column describing the futility of his father\u2019s last \u201cprecautionary\u201d trip to A&amp;E (3 April) highlights a rising challenge of the ageing population. As health and social care services collapse, the harms and indignities of hospital admission increase, especially for those least able to advocate for themselves. As a junior doctor working in A&amp;E, I loathed watching frail, mostly older people languish on trolleys in corridors, receiving substandard treatment that they didn\u2019t want and were unlikely to benefit from. This is now the norm in every hospital I\u2019ve been to. A 2014 study showed that more than a quarter of hospital inpatients die within a year. The risk, perhaps unsurprisingly, increases with age. It is our responsibility as clinicians to have difficult and frank conversations with patients ahead of time; to be pragmatic, realistic and kind in our decision-making. Unfortunately, lots of this comes under \u201cplanning for the future\u201d, which tends to slip down the to-do list during a crisis. It is the single most rewarding part of my work to have the time and opportunity to make care plans with patients, to know what matters most to them, and to stop the \u201cshrugs\u201d that Chiles faced at every turn. But medicine-by-protocol is quicker and cheaper than thought and pragmatism, so as resources are stretched ever further, it may continue to flourish. I am so sad for Peter Chiles\u2019s distress, and so grateful that his son uses his voice to call attention to it. Zachary Tait Manchester \u2022 I have been a GP partner in Battersea, London, for 20 years. Unfortunately, Adrian Chiles\u2019s opinion piece absolutely resonates. As clinicians, we are now taught to prioritise \u201csafety\u201d over all other considerations \u2013 despite the dangers inherent in doing so. Really, we are often protecting ourselves more than we are protecting our patients \u2013 an inadvertent side-effect of our unforgiving regulatory system. We doctors are behaving as \u201cartificial persons\u201d who represent the healthcare system, and not as moral agents who have a duty to create meaning with our patients. We urgently need to move into a moral era of medicine \u2013 one that rejects both the protectionism of the past and the reductionism of the current context, which so often results in the cruelties and inefficiencies that Chiles describes. Rupal Shah Co-author, Fighting for the Soul of General Practice \u2013 The Algorithm Will See You Now \u2022 Adrian Chiles\u2019s article stirred my thinking, as I have been on a similar journey. My husband died two weeks ago, having been advised that he had three months to live. This proved to be the case. With the Hospice at Home service, the NHS was truly wonderful. He died, however, with morphine slowly killing him. This could have been prevented if an assisted dying law was in place. One of the nurses said that what we were doing was cruel. We were able to resist a possible hospital admission for chest pains by having what is called a ReSPECT document signed by our GP for \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d, and because we had an advance directive, dated 2022, that had been placed with the GP and was on his medical records. This made the whole process so much easier for us, but also for the various wonderful medics. Parliament needs to update our laws to align with so many in this country who wish for greater clarity and support Dignity in Dying. Jo Fisher Brampton, Cambridgeshire \u2022 In response to Adrian Chiles\u2019s article, and having recently lost my own father, the best advice I can offer anyone is to make sure you have power of attorney in place for your parents. That is the way you can ensure that you have the power to override the decisions of medical staff who, while acting with the best intentions, will not know your parents as well as you do and may not make the decision that is best for them, or what they would have wanted. Having a power of attorney in place is more important than a will, in my view, because it enables you to help your living parent and ensure that their wishes are complied with. In my father\u2019s final days, I was asked numerous times: \u201cDo you have power of attorney?\u201d I was very relieved to be able to answer: \u201cYes.\u201d Rebecca Howling Toft, Cambridgeshire \u2022 As the daughter of an elderly parent, I very much understand the need for A&amp;E avoidance, to cause least distress. No doubt waiting haplessly alone for many hours hastens demise. However, as a GP, I know that the huge increase in litigation over the last 20 years is a very real threat to doctors\u2019 livelihoods. Even a simple complaint from a patient or their family can cause weeks, months, sometimes years, of stress to a health professional. Ruminating over every decision, every action or inaction, every justification, is enough to give us a heart attack \u2013 or worse, to make us follow in the footsteps of Paul Sinha and Adam Kay and quit the profession for a more peaceful existence. Name and address supplied \u2022 Dear Adrian, I am so sorry that this happened to your dad. Sadly, it is a story repeated again and again. I am what is termed a \u201clate career\u201d doctor (over 55), and I recently transitioned from working as an emergency consultant to become a GP working in aged care. Over my 30-year career, mainly in emergency and other hospital specialities, although including a significant period in palliative care, I slowly came to appreciate that the way we have set up our emergency system doesn\u2019t serve older people at all, and the frailest elderly are generally so poorly served that transferring them almost inevitably makes things worse. My residents (200 across five aged care facilities) all have discussion and documentation of whether they should go to hospital and under what circumstances. The staff know to call me if there is any uncertainty, day or night. I do lots of family meetings so relatives can feel confident that the right decisions will be made. I love looking after old people and ensuring they get the best care that is right for their individual circumstances. I firmly believe that aged care in particular is a GP subspecialty of its own. Too often care is fitted into lunch breaks and \u201con the way home\u201d visits, and devolved to phone services out of hours. This is no way to treat our oldest and frailest, who deserve so much better. Again, I am so sorry. Fiona Wallace Sheffield, Tasmania, Australia \u2022 I read Adrian Chiles\u2019s article about his father\u2019s experience with empathy. My own father led a district health authority, with many hospitals under his care. He was intensely proud of the NHS, but in his 90s he was very clear that he didn\u2019t wish to die in hospital or even to be admitted again unless absolutely essential. If he had an infection, he would be treated at home. Should it worsen and Dad die, it would be in his own bed. As a family, we listened. I was caring for him and know it took a huge weight off Dad\u2019s mind to know that he need not dread the ambulance or the bewilderment of a strange place. Too many elderly people die in the back of ambulances and in A&amp;E. Let those who are able to do so make informed choices about their end of life. It is a great comfort to them. Dr Jane Lovell Ashford, Kent \u2022 Adrian Chiles is correct that decisions about sending frail and elderly patients to hospital can be due to doctors being risk-averse. Doctors face a double jeopardy from the General Medical Council, who can take their livelihood, and the legal system if things go wrong. Not all families can accept when beloved elderly relatives have reached the end of their life. Some people have unrealistic expectations about what healthcare can achieve in frail patients, and push for investigations and treatments even when it seems unlikely to affect the final outcome. If these are not performed, doctors can be accused of negligence or ageism. Most doctors would like less invasive healthcare at the end of life for themselves and their own families than they routinely offer to patients. I would encourage everyone to write an advance directive or \u201cliving will\u201d outlining how they would like to be treated in the event of their health deteriorating. I would also suggest giving a trusted person power of attorney for healthcare. These can be very helpful in reducing incidents like the one described in the article. Dr Stephen Docherty Consultant radiologist, Dundee \u2022 I would like to express my condolences to Adrian Chiles on the death of his father. I can empathise with him on many levels. I too lost my father recently in not dissimilar circumstances. I am a practising GP, a former medical director of an out-of-hours GP service, and now spend most of time as a management consultant trying to influence change in the NHS to stop incidents like this happening. When I talk to clinicians and managers, I am always humbled by their devotion despite the pressures they work under. In my current assignment, over 32% of clinicians feel they are burnt out, and many more express intense frustration with the low-value clinical work they undertake. There is a limit to how much the system and the individuals who prop it up can give. The demand for care is rising every year. I suspect that the GP who decided to send Adrian\u2019s father to A&amp;E without seeing him was under pressure to make a number of decisions that night. Given more choice, I\u2019m sure they would have prioritised cases such as Adrian\u2019s father over lower-priority, often unnecessary cases. What we do not discuss as a society with as much fervour as the system and those who provide care is how we consume care, so we can create time and space to support those who really need necessary attention.

On Wednesday the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will announce that the government will overhaul the voluntary system that has left the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission flying blind when scrutinising mergers, because the regulator is only informed of about a quarter of mergers. But despite the ACCC asking for a new approval test, the Albanese government won\u2019t be reversing the onus of proof to require companies to prove the proposed deal wouldn\u2019t be likely to substantially lessen competition. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Instead it will tweak the merger test and bring three years of transactions within the scope of mandatory notification to prevent serial or creeping acquisitions flying under the radar. Chalmers will announce the merger law reforms at the ACCC\u2019s Bannerman competition lecture, arguing that the changes will help \u201cdifferentiate between harmful and beneficial mergers\u201d. In an advance copy of the speech seen by Guardian Australia, Chalmers says Australia\u2019s competitiveness has been declining since the 2000s with \u201cincreasing market concentration across industries\u201d. \u201cOver recent decades, the mark-ups that businesses apply to goods and services have increased by more than 2 percentage points,\u201d he says. \u201cReforms that address the decline in competition can deliver big economic benefits.\u201d Chalmers says the government wants to tackle mergers that \u201ccan cause serious economic harm\u201d because \u201cthey\u2019re solely focused on squeezing out competitors to capture a larger percentage of the market\u201d rather than lifting productivity. \u201cThis can strangle innovation, reduce productivity in our economy and punish consumers with reduced choice.\u201d Chalmers says Australia\u2019s merger laws are \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d because the ACCC \u201cisn\u2019t properly equipped to detect and act against anti-competitive mergers\u201d. Only 330 mergers are scrutinised a year, on average, but 1,400 mergers were recorded last year. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know whether these are the right 330, or the mergers with the greatest potential to cause harm,\u201d Chalmers says. The ACCC chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, says: \u201cWe welcome the treasurer\u2019s announcement today that the government will move to strengthen Australia\u2019s merger laws, which will benefit Australian consumers and businesses of all sizes, as well as the wider economy. \u201cHigher prices, less choice and less innovation can result from weakened competition. Stronger merger laws are critical to ensure anti-competitive mergers do not proceed.\u201d Under the new system \u201cmergers above monetary thresholds and which would significantly change market concentration will need to be notified to the ACCC and be approved before proceeding\u201d, Chalmers says. The thresholds \u2013 which will include a measure of market share \u2013 will be determined in 2024 before the new system begins in January 2026. The proposal paper says \u201call mergers within the previous three years by the acquirer or the target\u201d will count towards the threshold. Australia\u2019s competition laws have come under increased focus due to concerns market concentration is seeing consumers ripped off. The former ACCC chair Rod Sims has said the existing test that a merger will substantially lessen competition is nearly impossible to prove. The ACCC had asked for a new approval test, stating that a \u201cmerger can only proceed if the decision maker (the ACCC or tribunal on review) is satisfied that it is not likely to substantially lessen competition\u201d. In its submission the ACCC said this would mean \u201cwhere the material before the decision maker does not positively satisfy it that there is no likely substantial lessening of competition, a merger will not be approved\u201d. It rejected the claim this amounted to \u201ca reversal of the \u2018onus of proof\u2019 as this is an administrative decision being considered outside of the court context\u201d. According to the government response in the proposal paper the merger test will be strengthened by specifying that substantially lessening competition would include \u201cif the merger creates, strengthens or entrenches a position of substantial market power in any market\u201d. Chalmers argues that \u201cthe biggest reforms to merger settings in almost 50 years\u201d will help create \u201ca stronger, more competitive and more productive economy\u201d. In other changes, there will be a public register of all mergers and acquisitions notified to the ACCC, and the watchdog will become the \u201cthe single decision maker on all mergers\u201d. Mergers the ACCC says will pose no threat to competition will be approved within 30 days.

But what about vorfreude? I recently came across this lovely word, which my German-speaking friend translated as \u201cthe anticipation of joy\u201d. It struck me as such a hopeful concept \u2013 surely we could all do with less schadenfreude and more vorfreude. So what exactly is anticipatory joy, how do we cultivate it and will it make us happier? \u201cThe idea is to find joy in the lead-up to an event,\u201d says Dr Sophie Mort, a clinical psychologist and mental health expert at the meditation and mindfulness app Headspace. \u201cFor example, we often feel joy and excitement when planning a trip, thinking about going on a date or anticipating a special meal.\u201d It\u2019s easy to look forward to holidays and special occasions, but a joy-filled life is also about everyday occurrences. Rory Platt, a writer at the personal development company The School of Life, says: \u201cThe trick lies in filling our calendar with lots of little moments to look forward to \u2013 like tiny baubles that, when seen from a distance, combine to make a more glittering future.\u201d But vorfreude is not about wishing your life away and thinking you will be happy in an imagined future. \u201cLooking forward to something can trigger joy in the present moment,\u201d says Karen Neil, a health coach and the founder of Mindful Medicine. This can boost your mood, reduce your stress levels and help to avoid burnout. A 2017 study published in Frontiers of Psychology found that anticipating positive events activated the brain\u2019s medial prefrontal cortex, which is associated with a higher level of wellbeing. Doesn\u2019t getting your hopes up risk disappointment? Perhaps it\u2019s safer to keep expectations low. Emma Mills, a mindfulness expert and the author of Inhale Exhale Repeat, begs to differ. \u201cThere is a saying: \u2018If you worry, you suffer twice.\u2019 Anticipatory joy is the opposite of that.\u201d Even if an anticipated event turns out to be a letdown, vorfreude helps people bounce back. \u201cOptimists have improved coping abilities when dealing with unplanned distress and they tend to recover far faster,\u201d says Tania Taylor, a psychotherapist and vorfreude advocate. If you are going through a tough time and feel as though you have nothing to look forward to, don\u2019t beat yourself up. \u201cIt\u2019s important that positive psychology doesn\u2019t get confused with toxic positivity,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cWhen I was going through cancer treatment, I spent most days binge\u2011watching television. It\u2019s OK to sit tight when everything feels overwhelming without feeling guilt that you are not looking for joy.\u201d If feelings of hopelessness persist, she stresses, it\u2019s important to seek help from a GP, a therapist or charities such as Samaritans or Shout. If, however, you are ready for vorfreude, it shouldn\u2019t feel like a chore. \u201cMostly, it will involve exploring what you already have in your life that you look forward to,\u201d says Taylor. Willem Kuyken, a professor of mindfulness at the University of Oxford, has researched the benefits of cultivating joy. In his book Mindfulness for Life, he writes: \u201cIt takes only a small step out of habit and into awareness to enjoy the people we love around us, to savour food or to dance to music in our kitchen while cooking. These moments are available to us all the time.\u201d With that in mind, here are 30 simple ways to get more vorfreude in your life. Start (really) small If the concept of vorfreude is completely alien to you, take baby steps. \u201cTry to notice one joyful thing each day,\u201d says Neil. You could frame this as a photo challenge: spend a little time every day looking for one beautiful flower, interesting sight or cute dog to photograph. Think positive \u201cPlan a morning affirmation or positive statement and look forward to starting your day with it in your mind,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cSome people create a screensaver with it on their phone so it\u2019s the first thing they see.\u201d An example she gives is: \u201cToday I will look for good moments and remember them.\u201d Mort suggests: \u201cMay I be open to joy and have many moments of joy ahead.\u201d Turn routine into ritual \u201cA very small thing that I get vorfreude from is anticipating my first coffee of the day,\u201d says Mort. \u201cWhen I wake up, it\u2019s the first thing I think about: how it will smell, how it will taste and how I will feel while drinking it. It\u2019s a ritual that I love and I really allow myself to focus on it.\u201d Find joy in the everyday \u201cAt the end of my evening meditation classes, I suggest people consider three things they are looking forward to tomorrow,\u201d says Mills. \u201cIt could be their morning walk in the park or listening to a podcast on their commute; maybe sitting down to enjoy their packed lunch at work or looking forward to having a bath at the end of the day.\u201d Come off autopilot \u201cPerhaps you have a hobby such as gardening, or a pet to spend time with,\u201d says Karen Atkinson, the CEO of MindfulnessUK. \u201cComing out of autopilot and consciously looking forward to these moments is an achievable way for anyone to experience vorfreude.\u201d Avoid mind traps \u201cTo change your mindset to become more joyful, you must first become familiar with your own negative thought patterns,\u201d says Atkinson. These \u201cmind traps\u201d include catastrophising and discounting the positive. \u201cFor example, instead of thinking: \u2018I\u2019m only going away for one night \u2013 it\u2019s hardly a holiday,\u2019 say to yourself: \u2018What a treat \u2013 a night away, going out to dinner and meeting friends. How lovely.\u2019\u201d The \u201cshoulds\u201d are another trap. \u201cYou may think: \u2018I should have a more thriving social life, like everyone else.\u2019 Instead, recognise that Fomo [fear of missing out] can add stress. Remember how fortunate you are to go out and have fun once in a while \u2013 really cherish the opportunity.\u201d Savour the moment \u201cThere is a small moment just before you eat your pastry, or the movie begins, or as you get in your bubble bath,\u201d says Mills. \u201cIn that moment, the pastry hasn\u2019t been eaten yet \u2013 it\u2019s a joy about to be enjoyed. Savour the moment and think how lucky you are.\u201d She likes a Kurt Vonnegut quote: \u201cAnd I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point: \u2018If this isn\u2019t nice, I don\u2019t know what is.\u2019\u201d Treat yourself \u201cSchedule brief excursions and small indulgences,\u201d says Platt. \u201cPerhaps aim to finish work an hour early on Fridays to get dinner with a friend, visit an art gallery or take yourself on a solo cinema trip.\u201d Don\u2019t feel guilty about it. The team at The Mindfulness Project says: \u201cGiving yourself permission to look forward to these pleasures can prepare you to enjoy them.\u201d Put plans in writing One of the exercises in I Am Here Now, a book by The Mindfulness Project, is getting into the habit of writing down plans. The authors suggest rating your anticipation levels, but even the simple act of putting pen to paper can make plans feel more real and increase excitement. Keep a joy journal \u201cJoy is individual,\u201d says Neil. \u201cThere are common themes \u2013 we can all appreciate a happy child playing \u2013 but it\u2019s about finding what brings you joy.\u201d She advises people to keep a joy journal, noting down what has made you happy that day, week or month. That way, you can plan more of it in the future. Schedule movement \u201cI\u2019ll plan 10 minutes of gentle stretching or book an activity session such as a yoga, pilates or a sound bath class,\u201d says Taylor. If that sounds more like punishment than pleasure, remember exercise is individual, too \u2013 so find something you enjoy. Try meal planning \u201cCreating a meal plan for the week means you can look forward to what you are going to eat,\u201d says Taylor. She suggests using a slow cooker if you are pushed for time: \u201cThis week, I\u2019m looking forward to making rice pudding in mine.\u201d Make a date with a friend Kareen Griffiths, a mindful change consultant, likes to plan a big night out. \u201cI relish the moments in the buildup: putting on my outfit, the train journey, the feeling of excitement,\u201d she says. Taylor gets just as much vorfreude out of arranging for a friend to come over to watch a film. The important thing is making time to meet up with someone you care about. Plan a fantasy holiday \u2026 \u201cThe other day, I saw a social media post about a cheap mini-break to Rome. It had me getting excited about a variety of really affordable getaways \u2013 even though my passport has expired,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI must get around to renewing it, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from getting enjoyment out of the anticipation of what might be.\u201d \u2026 and enjoy the buildup to a real one \u201cSome research shows that planning and anticipating a holiday can make you happier than the holiday itself,\u201d says Mort. \u201cThis switched me from being a spontaneous \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll leave it till the last minute and book just before I go away\u2019 person to being someone who takes time to mull over where I want to go, why I want to go there and how it might be when I get there.\u201d Look for natural wonders \u201cI\u2019m a huge advocate of finding joy in nature. The research tells us time and again how valuable it can be,\u201d says Taylor. That doesn\u2019t have to mean going far from home. \u201cThe other day I popped out into my very wet garden and touched the daffodils. I noticed how wonderful it was that the daffodil stems were being held together by an old fallen leaf that they had managed to create a hole through.\u201d Go on a mindful walk \u201cWhen I\u2019m out walking the dog, I try to be aware of what\u2019s around me, whether that\u2019s the blossom coming out on the trees or the stars at night,\u201d says Neil. \u201cThoughts and worries may come: \u2018Spring is early \u2013 it must be climate change.\u2019 But I try to let go of all that on the walk.\u201d Hunt for treasure Taylor loved geocaching with her children when they were younger. \u201cIt\u2019s a free app that involves treasure-hunting wherever you are in the world. You find hidden tubs filled with toys to swap,\u201d she says. \u201cI do it without the kids, now that they\u2019re older. I love leaving Christmas-cracker toys and knowing that it will put a smile on a child\u2019s face in the future.\u201d Do something creative \u201cResearch examining the impact of creativity on mental health is largely positive,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cTry planning some time to let your creative side flare.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a natural artist. If you can\u2019t paint or draw, her ideas include \u201ccutting out pictures that are meaningful to you in magazines and creating a collage, writing your own poem or story or watching YouTube origami tutorials armed with a piece of plain paper\u201d. Make music Neil plays the bass clarinet with the Nottingham Philharmonic Orchestra, \u201cso a lot of my joy comes through music\u201d, she says. \u201cAt the first rehearsal after a concert, we get new music to learn for the next performance. I always feel anticipatory joy before new music night.\u201d The less musically experienced could join a (non\u2011audition) community choir or start learning an instrument. Which leads us to \u2026 Try something new \u201cBook a new dance class or craft workshop to try something different,\u201d suggests Mort. \u201cThe suspense of learning something new can add a spark of excitement to the week.\u201d It could even change your life. Griffiths learned to play decks two years ago, as a tribute to her late brother, and is now a mindful DJ. \u201cIt was never part of my plan,\u201d she says. \u201cMy music connects me to the here and now, which is where joy can be found.\u201d Go to the library \u201cMaking a regular trip to your local library is a great way to insert vorfreude into your life,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cHave you ever had that feeling when you are really enjoying the book you are reading, but you\u2019re also excited to start the next one? That\u2019s a perfect example.\u201d Mort suggests setting a reading challenge \u2013 it could be reading all the books on the Booker longlist, finally getting round to reading Moby-Dick or rereading your favourite books. Read a poem a day \u201cI recommend buying a poetry anthology \u2013 then you can look forward to reading the poem of the day over breakfast or lunch or at bedtime,\u201d says Mills. She suggests A Nature Poem for Every Day of the Year: \u201cI look forward each evening to seeing which poem it is.\u201d Throw a party Taylor loves planning birthday parties. \u201cMy daughter has a big birthday coming up this year and I\u2019m so excited about my plans,\u201d she says. But you don\u2019t need a birthday to have a party. \u201cOrganise a get-together with friends, whether it\u2019s a games day in the park or a themed party,\u201d says Mort. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for a reason to celebrate \u2013 create one.\u201d Celebrate the seasons \u201cI look forward to seasonal changes and put them in my diary as \u2018occasions\u2019: spring equinox, midsummer, midwinter, full moon, apple season,\u201d says Mills. \u201cIf you identify these small joys and appreciate them as they happen, you have many special occasions.\u201d Do something for others \u201c\u2018Sympathetic joy\u2019 is experiencing the joy of others,\u201d says Neil. It doesn\u2019t need to be a grand gesture \u2013 planning a little treat for someone else can spark vorfreude. \u201cI got my hands on some small Easter egg packs this year,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to hide the eggs around the house and garden for my adult children to find, and to watch them laugh at the ridiculous things their parents have them doing.\u201d Find a talisman Neil enjoys watching her daughter and her friends play the video game Animal Crossing. \u201cThere\u2019s a turtle character who sings a little song. It sounds silly, but watching them ride in the turtle\u2019s boat brings me joy,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter bought me a little turtle figure and now I look at it if I\u2019m having a hard day.\u201d She suggests displaying your own talisman \u2013 a photograph, a holiday trinket, a nature find \u2013 to spark happiness. Create a homecoming ritual \u201cAnticipate the joy of reuniting with loved ones by creating a special greeting ritual when you come home from work,\u201d says Mort. \u201cIt could be a hug, a quick card game or simply taking a moment to connect and unwind together.\u201d What if you live alone? \u201cTry asking yourself: \u2018What is one small thing that I would like to do?\u2019\u201d Then do it! Make time for silence Vorfreude isn\u2019t just about parties, holidays and hobbies. \u201cJust a few minutes of meditation a day can not only change our perspective, but also physically alter our brains, rewiring them towards more positive thoughts and emotions,\u201d says Mort. \u201cClose the door, light a candle and embrace moments of stillness. Look forward to the peace that comes with each session.\u201d Platt stresses the importance of having a break from the grim news cycle. \u201cWe owe it to ourselves to switch off from time to time in order to focus on all that remains good and hopeful in the here and now.\u201d Get ready for bed \u201cI must be getting old, because I really look forward to my bed and a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cEvery night, I look forward to going to sleep listening to hypnotherapy.\u201d Mills, too, gets joy from having a bath, putting on pyjamas and climbing into fresh sheets. Double the pleasure by squeezing in an afternoon nap \u2013 vorfreude doesn\u2019t get much easier than that.", "date": "2024-04-09", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Rachel Dixon", "id": 111, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3f3032a3e2b7983d08aaf1939ac395723c50eca0/3_0_10411_6250/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Rats and cockroaches among thousands of pests found at English hospitals", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/09/rats-cockroaches-pests-english-hospitals-nhs", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.12, "neu": 0.605, "pos": 0.275, "compound": 0.9981}, "body": "Thousands of pests including rats, cockroaches and bedbugs have been found at NHS hospitals in England as the health service buckles under a record high repair bill. Hospital bosses are having to spend millions of pounds on pest control after discovering lice, flies and rodents in children\u2019s wards, breast clinics, maternity units, A&amp;E departments and kitchens, in the most graphic illustration yet of the dismal and dangerous state of the NHS estate. NHS bosses have repeatedly warned ministers of the urgent need to plough cash into fixing rundown buildings in order to protect the safety and dignity of patients and staff. The maintenance backlog now stands at \u00a311.6bn in England. Figures obtained under freedom of information laws and reviewed by the Guardian suggest the NHS is struggling to cope with an army of pests plaguing decrepit hospitals. There were more than 18,000 pest incidents in the last three years, the NHS data reveals. There were 6,666 last year, equivalent to 18 a day. The figures also show NHS bosses are having to spend millions of pounds calling out pest control and dealing with infestations, with \u00a33.7m spent in the last three years. The data requests to 142 NHS hospital trusts in England, made by the Liberal Democrats, yielded only 59 responses \u2013 suggesting the cost and true number of incidents were much higher. Of trusts that responded, Imperial College healthcare NHS trust in London spent the most on pest control in the last three years, \u00a3383,597, with 2,157 incidents. East and North Hertfordshire NHS trust spent \u00a3119,199 to deal with dozens of incidents, including mice in a kitchen, maggots in a mortuary, rat droppings in a corpse bag and silverfish insects in a doctors\u2019 mess. The Princess Alexandra hospital NHS trust in Essex spent \u00a3273,330 on pest control. It reported 77 incidents including ants in a maternity ward, a fly infestation in a \u201cclean utility room\u201d, rat droppings in corridors and rodents in the ceiling. Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said the revelations were \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d, adding: \u201cNo one should have to endure being exposed to insects, rodents or other pests when they are already dealing with illness or injury.\u201d Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, the membership organisation for hospitals, said far too many NHS buildings were \u201cin a very bad way\u201d. The \u00a311.6bn backlog bill was also rising at an \u201calarming rate\u201d, she added, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s worrying that on top of this trusts have to spend millions on pest control.\u201d Hospitals urgently needed government investment to tackle the \u201csignificant risks\u201d to the safety of patients and staff, Cordery said. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the revelations were shocking and another sign that hospitals were no longer up to scratch for sick patients and hard-working staff. \u201cIn people\u2019s hour of need, they need to be safe from bugs and rodents. Instead, wards are falling apart at the seams with foul pests allowed to roam freely,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a national scandal.\u201d Davey urged ministers to immediately provide emergency funds to resolve the crisis. \u201cThis Conservative government has left the NHS in decay with soaring repair bills. This madness has to end. \u201cIt is time the NHS was put first, starting with making hospitals a safe and clean place again. Conservative ministers cannot hide any longer from the state of the NHS.\u201d Imperial College healthcare said it was committed to ensuring clean and safe spaces for its patients, visitors and staff and had \u201cstrong pest control measures in place\u201d alongside \u201crigorous infection prevention and control processes\u201d. East and North Hertfordshire trust said it wanted to provide a clean and safe environment and had allocated funding for improving pest control, enabling it to \u201cquickly resolve issues\u201d and prevent as many as possible. Michael Meredith, the director of strategy and estates at the Princess Alexandra trust, said he took pest control seriously and was proud of \u201cthe quick and decisive action\u201d the trust had taken to eradicate any problems. The Department of Health and Social Care said NHS hospital trusts were legally responsible for maintaining their estates, including pest control, and added that it had invested significant sums to upgrade and modernise NHS buildings, including \u00a34.2bn this year. \u201cWe have also invested a further \u00a31.7bn for over 70 hospital upgrades across England,\u201d a spokesperson added.", "date": "2024-04-09", "section": "Society", "author": "Andrew Gregory Health editor", "id": 112, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e1338d7546e49da84159a10f22ffbfcb3e66c248/0_250_3891_2334/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Michael Palin on the loss of his wife of 57 years: \u2018I\u2019d love Helen to still be here, telling me off\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/09/michael-palin-loss-of-his-wife-of-57-years-would-love-helen-to-still-be-here-telling-me-off", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.123, "neu": 0.637, "pos": 0.239, "compound": 0.9994}, "body": "The strange thing about Michael Palin is you feel you know him; that he\u2019s an old friend or much-loved uncle you\u2019ve not seen for a while. He decides to come to Guardian HQ for our interview, and nobody seems surprised to see him, despite the fact that it\u2019s his first time in the building. People smile at Palin with easy familiarity: ah, Michael\u2019s popped in. He smiles back with that fabulously genial smile: a little bit cheeky, a little bit shy, and very warm. We have never met before. But he\u2019s been in my life for 50-odd years. First as part of Monty Python, the surrealist comedy troupe I quoted ad nauseam as a youngster (\u201cNobody expects the Spanish inquisition!\u201d), then as star of the wonderful TV series Ripping Yarns, which I also quoted ad nauseam (\u201cOh shut up, you boring little tit!\u201d). There were also the films: Time Bandits, A Private Function, A Fish Called Wanda and, more recently, The Death of Stalin. For the past 35 years, he has travelled the globe for TV shows, and written books to accompany his odysseys. In 2019, he was knighted for services to travel, culture and geography \u2013 the only Python to receive a knighthood. Now he has got a new three-part TV series about Nigeria, where he meets young people hoping to make their fortune: a young woman trying to rebuild her life after being kidnapped by Boko Haram; an environmentalist fighting government corruption; and a woman who berates him for the sins of British colonialism in Benin. It is fascinating to observe the dynamics between the diffident, eternally apologetic Palin and the more direct Nigerians. He is visibly shocked when the woman shouts him down in the street and makes him take the rap for Britain\u2019s brutal Benin Expedition of 1897. The series is important for him as an exploration of Nigeria, as well as a means of confronting Britain\u2019s past. But it is also important in a more personal way. This is the first major project he has taken on since his wife Helen died 10 months ago. They had been married for 57 years, having first met in 1959, on a family trip to Southwold in Suffolk, when he was 15 and she was 16. Their holiday romance was fictionalised in his 1987 BBC drama East of Ipswich. Although Helen rarely accompanied him on his travels, he worried he wouldn\u2019t be able to do the Nigeria trip without her. \u201cI was quite concerned about whether I could physically and mentally deal with it just a few months after Helen had died. But I enjoyed the experience tremendously. I felt I can do this, I can get out there. It\u2019s not someone giving me a job because my wife\u2019s just died. Actually, it regenerated me in a way.\u201d Helen, a teacher and then a bereavement counsellor, was 80 when she died of kidney failure, after stopping her dialysis treatment because she was in so much pain. It was Helen, he says, who encouraged him to do the travel documentaries in the first place. Palin was 45 when he was offered Around the World in 80 Days, a seven-part BBC series inspired by the Jules Verne novel. \u201cHelen was quite clear that if I didn\u2019t do this I\u2019d be sort of moodily staring across the kitchen table at someone else doing it. She knew I\u2019d be happier if I did the travels and avoided staying at home.\u201d His expeditions included the 23,000-mile trip from the north to south pole, North Korea, and Ethiopia mid-coup. Did Helen worry for him? He laughs. If she did, she didn\u2019t show it. \u201cShe was quite calm about wherever I was.\u201d Palin is a master of understatement, opinions usually qualified by \u201cquite\u201d. He could be away for five months at a time. Sometimes he would find it hard, he says, but he\u2019s convinced his travels helped their marriage. How? \u201cWell, they say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and it\u2019s true. Our relationship was very loving, but it was very practical. Very pragmatic.\u201d Although they valued their independence, they shared so much: values, confidences, sense of humour, friends. During Helen\u2019s final two years she suffered huge discomfort. \u201cShe told me how ill she felt, how unhappy she felt at not being able to live the life she wanted. Most of my time was spent just trying to assuage her pain. She was amazing how she dealt with it.\u201d Helen died at the Marie Curie Hospice in Hampstead, north London, last May. Palin says the final couple of weeks, with their three children there, too, could not have been happier. \u201cJust before she died, when she knew she was going to die, were actually some of the best times we\u2019ve had. I was prepared for it. Helen had taken the decision that she wasn\u2019t going to carry on having dialysis. She was amazingly well looked after, and all the family were there. And that was the payoff for all those years, those 60 years.\u201d He talks so tenderly about Helen and the end of her life. Then he comes to an abrupt stop, as if clicked out of hypnosis. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m waffling,\u201d he says. No you\u2019re not, I say. I ask what he means by the payoff. \u201cWell, because we\u2019d spent so long together, we knew each other pretty well.\u201d He pauses. Even he knows this is an understatement too far. \u201cVery, very well. It didn\u2019t all have to be stated why we\u2019d like this or that. We didn\u2019t have to say a lot. It was just there. So knowing that she had two weeks to live, somehow everything that had been part of our relationship made it much easier to deal with her departure.\u201d There were no scores to settle, confessions to make, or misunderstandings to iron out. They knew everything about each other. So there wasn\u2019t even much need for talking. \u201cThe most important thing to me in her last days was making sure she had access to the family and friends I knew she loved and would not see again. I was just sort of shepherding her through and making sure she was able to talk to the people she wanted to talk to; or, if she just wanted peace and quiet, she\u2019d have peace and quiet.\u201d Does it still seem very recent? \u201cYes. I mean, I\u2019m quite surprised. I\u2019ve been working quite hard since she died, and that\u2019s been a distraction. But every now and then, the house seems empty and you feel you\u2019ll never have a friend as close as that; you\u2019ll never have someone who knows as much about you as Helen did about me. There are things I can\u2019t talk about in the same way to anybody else. I\u2019ve got lots of good friends, and we can chat about things, but, you know, the rapport between the two of us over all these years was quite singular. And I miss that. I sometimes think: she lived to be 80, I\u2019m 80 now, so what\u2019s next? What do you do with the rest of the time? Partly, I think, well, at 80 you\u2019re on your way to the departure lounge.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say this in a maudlin way. It feels more as if he\u2019s thinking aloud. You are an incredibly youthful 80, I say. Would you like to find somebody you could share things with in the same way? \u201cOh, I just can\u2019t imagine anybody else taking Helen\u2019s place.\u201d Anyway, he says, in some sense she\u2019s still with him. \u201cI always listen to Helen. I mean, I\u2019m kind of in touch with her on a daily basis because I know what she would think about all the various things that I do.\u201d Do you talk to her? \u201cWell, yeah, I do occasionally.\u201d When? \u201cWell, I just do it coming into an empty room after you\u2019ve had a long session or something, doing a long interview for the Guardian, whatever, something that really kind of wears you out! You get in and you\u2019re going through the door, and I always speak and say: \u2018Whoa, wow, that was something!\u2019 It\u2019s just as a little moment, which helps me when I get into the house, rather than just going in and it\u2019s all key in the lock and silence.\u201d Look, he says, he\u2019s not complaining. He knows he\u2019s been lucky to experience such love. Come to think of it, he says, he\u2019s been lucky in life. Palin grew up in Sheffield. Like his father (an engineer who worked for a steel company) and his grandfather, he went to the private school Shrewsbury and was Oxbridge educated. His father, Edward, had a good sense of humour, but his jokes were impeded by a terrible stammer. \u201cHe was quite an angry man, and he had quite a short fuse. It was difficult in the house to talk about things, generally. And he was picking arguments all the time with my mother. I think he rather took it out on people around him. He was very confrontational, which has made me unconfrontational. I try anything to avoid confrontation.\u201d Typically of Palin, rather than rejecting his father, he sought to understand his frustration and gave his name to the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering. He never dared to dream of making a career out of comedy, acting, travelling or writing. (The project he says he\u2019s proudest of is his 2018 book, Erebus: The Story of a Ship, about the eponymous vessel that ventured farther south than any human had ever been on its first voyage, and vanished with its 129-strong crew in the wastes of the Canadian Arctic on its second.) Palin assumed he was destined for a regular, respectable job. But, he says, he has always been in the right place at the right time. At Oxford, he met the cultural historian Robert Hewison, who suggested his humour was a gift and potentially a lucrative one. He was introduced to future fellow Pythons, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Graham Chapman, who had all studied at Cambridge, and they decided to work as a team. Perhaps luckiest of all was the day they visited the BBC in 1969 on the off-chance of getting some work. \u201cIt was remarkable. We were chaperoned by Barry Took who was very keen on the work we\u2019d done individually. He said: \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got a suit on and I can take you to the BBC and find you someone we can talk to. We were ushered into a small room and Michael Mills, who was head of comedy, came in after quite a good lunch I think, because he was in quite a good mood, and he asked us various questions about what we wanted to do. None of which we were able to adequately respond to. It was the world\u2019s worst job interview. Was there going to be music? We don\u2019t know. Were there going to be guest artists? Well, we don\u2019t know. Were there going to be women in the show? We don\u2019t know. At the end, Mills stood up and looked down the table at us and said: \u2018I\u2019ll give you 13 shows but that\u2019s all.\u2019 It was the best sentence anybody\u2019s ever said to me in my life.\u201d Does he think that could happen at the BBC today? \u201cNo. The BBC was much more buccaneering back then. There were individuals who could make decisions on their own if they wanted to take a chance with something others didn\u2019t like. And, to be honest, most people in the BBC hierarchy didn\u2019t like Monty Python to start with at all. But you could do it and it would be respected. Now there would be far more investigations into what you wanted to do, people checking content and that you\u2019re not being rude about people. I don\u2019t think it would have gone anywhere today. It would have been censored at source.\u201d Palin shares some of the concerns Cleese has expressed about topics increasingly being considered off limits in comedy. \u201cAt the moment it\u2019s getting a bit ridiculous, when there are strictures over what you can say. I don\u2019t think the outside world should impose on comedy. Comedy should subvert. Comedy\u2019s got to make you feel freer.\u201d Why does he think Python proved so influential? \u201cPeople found it quite bracing. You were able to make jokes about the prime minister and the army and the church, which you\u2019d never been able to do before. It\u2019s very important that people can escape, in comedy, from the conformity they\u2019re forced into.\u201d He says it is dangerous to be rose-tinted about the past, but he does worry that the country has become more intolerant and less caring. \u201cPolitical discourse has become very unpleasant. The country is run on the basis of getting as much money out of people as we can everywhere. It\u2019s all about marketing and selling.\u201d Does he think he has changed over the years? \u201cNot really. I\u2019m a cautious and slightly shy person and always have been. But I\u2019ve been given a chance to do things I never expected. All that is quite surprising to me.\u201d There have been profoundly bleak moments in his life. He lost too many friends early, including former Pythons Terry Jones (his main collaborator) and Chapman, as well as ex-Beatle George Harrison. His sister Angela killed herself when she was 52, something he has never come to terms with. \u201cShe was absolutely terrific. But she had this long-term depression. I could never quite understand where it came from, how deep it was, but it was there. That was a loss I\u2019ve never really quite understood. I can\u2019t understand why somebody, who had such talent and ability and was so liked, should have \u2026 why there should have been such a dark space there \u2026\u201d He trails off. Fortunately, he says, his disposition is sunny, and the stability in his life has kept him grounded. Again, he returns to Helen. \u201cMy horizons are fairly local. Helen and I were together for 60 years, we lived in the same part of London a long time; I have never wanted to change the basics of my life: the relationships, the friends, the house. It\u2019s been essential for them to be there so I could not get totally deluded by fame and success.\u201d Palin is all talked out. He tells me, apologetically, that he is exhausted, and again mentions his age. \u201cI\u2019m 80-plus now,\u201d he says. What\u2019s with the plus? \u201cOK, 80 and 11 months!\u201d He grins. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go walking off the end of a pier.\u201d I tell him I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ready for the departure lounge, or the end of the pier. He nods, and says I\u2019ve got a point. In 2019, he had open-heart surgery: one valve replaced, one repaired. \u201cNow that\u2019s sorted, and I\u2019m more cautious about what I eat and drink, I feel fitter than I have done in ages.\u201d All things considered, he says, he\u2019s pretty content. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep doing things. I\u2019d love Helen to still be with me, telling me off, but yes, I\u2019m very happy where I am.\u201d Michael Palin in Nigeria starts on 16 April at 9pm on Channel 5.

Please keep sending us your thoughts, and get ready to vote this weekend. Hummingbird hawk-moth The first time I saw one up close I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. So weird and beautiful. It was when I had been made redundant from a job I hated and was trying to figure out what to do next. My neighbour\u2019s children were transfixed by the hawk-moth and I took delight in their curiosity. That\u2019s when I decided to go into teaching. I still only see one very occasionally, they are quite rare. Inspirational insects deserve recognition. Kate Jannaway, 51, works in SEND support for an FE college, Brighton Red-tailed bumblebee I\u2019d like to posit that the humble bumblebee deserves this accolade for one simple reason: it brings joy. Regardless of one\u2019s age, it is hard to not see a bumblebee and experience a moment of glee; this tiny, fuzzy, creature, flying around with what seems like little consideration of any of its surroundings, has the capability to make anyone smile. At a time when conservation of wildlife is becoming more and more pressing, I think it is important to highlight the everyday species that often inspire children to explore the field into adulthood. Ronnie Matczuk, 24, bar operations manager, London Common woodlouse They are little troopers, doing so much for us, which most are not aware of. Highly evolved from the oceans (which is why they like it a little damp) to be on land with us, cleaning our soil, recycling dead matter, curl up when scared like a pangolin, and the moms even have a little pouch to keep their babies in! They live for a long time compared to others their size, love being with each other, do so much for the environment and yet are still so humble. Love them so much. Kathleen Woodward, 45, works in a museum, Derby Dark-edged bee-fly These characterful little insects are early emergers and their appearance gives real hope that spring is close. They look fantastic with furry ginger bodies and an outrageously long proboscis and have a fascinating lifestyle. This includes spinning display flights and territorial disputes amongst the males and the female coating her eggs with sand or soil before flicking them into the nest holes of solitary bees. What\u2019s not to love? Nick Morgan, 63, accountant, North Yorkshire Common cockchafer Cockchafers (known also as maybugs \u2013 though they\u2019re not true bugs, they\u2019re beetles) are such delightful, characterful things. As their nickname suggests, adults are abundant in late spring/early summer \u2013 they\u2019re often spotted bumbling along or flying into things (for those who do mothing, they can be a lovely surprise as they quite often find their merry way into traps). Though the adults live for only five to six weeks, in which time they reproduce and females lay their eggs, their larvae remain in the soil for up to two years, chomping on plant roots. As well as being very friendly-looking beasts, they\u2019ve also had a great cultural impact \u2013 including as emblems of queer zoology. An 1896 drawing of two male cockchafers copulating by the French naturalist, Henri Gadeau de Kerville, is thought to be the first rendering of same-sex sexual behaviour in a non-human animal. Cockchafers have also caused their fair share of aggravation in the agricultural world; a 15th-century French court actually placed the beetles on trial for crop destruction. Though then they were deemed \u201cirrational and imperfect creatures\u201d, I plead the contrary. Biliana Todorova, 23, doctoral candidate, Oxford Rhinoceros beetle Out for a walk along Kerridge Hill, I was startled when a big black beetle landed on my hand \u2026 My instinctive reaction was to instantly slap it off my hand \u2013 but fortunately I was holding my camera in that hand, and I just managed to stop myself and take a look at what it was first. I\u2019m glad I did! The female rhinoceros (the males have a horn) was so delicate and obliging I managed to swap her over to my left hand and snap a few portraits of her beautiful glossy armour before we went our separate ways. Despite the scary appearance she seemed curious, and moved very slowly and tickled my hand as she walked daintily around, exploring this strange new landscape. Why is our first reaction to a strange insect usually to immediately try to kill it? Anthony Skellern, semi-retired graphic designer, Bollington Common sexton beetle What a marvellous clear-up job they do for us. I used to wander in the countryside all the time, and one day I spotted a red squirrel tail lying among the dead leaves on the ground. I tugged at it and up came a whole red squirrel, to my astonishment. It seems it would be the food supply, for some time, for the larvae of this beetle. Without that help the world would be covered in tiny smelly corpses, with flies hovering about and their own larvae feeding on them. I have often felt guilty about my action, rendering the industrious beetle with an arduous repeat burial. Hilary Kirkby, 77, retired, south of France Manx shearwater flea The Manx flea is one of the only insects found exclusively in the UK. It is threatened with extinction and listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. It is found only on the windswept Isle of R\u00f9m, off the west coast of Scotland within a single colony of Manx shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus), which serve as its hosts. So often invertebrate advocacy focuses on charismatic groups like bees and butterflies, but this year we have the opportunity to highlight one of the \u201csmall majority\u201d of invertebrates overlooked by most people because they aren\u2019t as appealing. The Manx flea is as British as Stonehenge, symbolises the plight of many threatened parasites, and is an incredibly unique insect worthy of a place to compete for UK invertebrate of the year! Mackenzie L Kwak, 30, academic, Japan Harvestman A class, not a species. But I\u2019m referring to one of its members: what many people call \u201cdaddy long legs\u201d. An amazing arachnid that thrives despite eating (apparently) nothing. I\u2019ve never seen one eat anything \u2013 and I share my house with these creatures all the time. It looks impossibly, wondrously frail, its gossamer legs a marvel of articulation. They sit in corners, motionless. Never seen them outside. Where would they live without humans? I don\u2019t know. Wonderful, mysterious survivors. Simon Jones, 68, book translator, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire Devil\u2019s coach-horse It\u2019s possibly the most ferocious beetle there is in the UK: a fearsome predator that\u2019s mega aggressive, eats other invertebrates, and has scorpion-like pincers. It terrifies and delights people bug spotting in equal measure, but is not well known about (although common) as active at night. The name alone lets you know how vicious it can be, and they wouldn\u2019t be afraid to bite humans either! Like a honey badger in beetle form. Jess Richards, Staffordshire Medicinal leech The European medicinal leech was overused in past centuries for medical purposes and although they\u2019re considered near threatened, they are endangered in the UK. They are still used in medicine because of their incredible saliva, which has uses as an anticoagulant and has its own anaesthetic effect! These creatures have been used by humans for thousands of years and we\u2019re only now fully understanding their amazing physiology, as we\u2019ve pushed them to the brink of extinction in some countries. They\u2019ve got three jaws and a hundred teeth, they\u2019re slimy and a little creepy, but they\u2019re incredible little creatures who we owe it to save. Avery Kilmarnock Common garden snail I used to enjoy getting out into the natural world, but now my disability is so limiting that I\u2019m rarely able to leave home. I so love the way that whenever it rains our garden is suddenly alive with snails, all rushing about (at a snail\u2019s pace) to make the most of what to them is perfect weather. It\u2019s fascinating to watch a life form so unimaginably different from us getting on with its daily business as if we weren\u2019t here. Lois Pass, 59, Southend-on-Sea, Strawberry spider If people say we have dull-looking invertebrates in this country then they have never seen this spider. Its common name is the strawberry spider and with the bright colour and markings you will see why it gets its name. It\u2019s a favourite because it not only builds an awesome orb web, but then weaves two leaves together to make a bell shape and hangs that in the top of the web as a retreat. It took me five years to find one of these spiders and I was so pleased to see and photograph it. So when you next see a spider around maybe salute him or her for the good they do. Or at the very least if you have one in your home and you\u2019re not keen just try and help it back outside. It\u2019s important to remember it\u2019s not just our planet, and everything from the largest to the smallest deserves our respect and its place on this sphere we call home. James Chisnall, 44, engineer, West Sussex Bumblebee Best. Invertebrate. EVER. As the Bumblebee Conservation Trust puts it: \u201cBumblebees are large, furry and charismatic four-winged insects.\u201d And with a Latin name of \u201cBombus\u201d \u2013 which perfectly describes them \u2013 how can you not adore them! Fluffy bums, hard-working and so very lovely. From early spring to late autumn and sometimes even into early winter, they give me such joy and hope to watch them \u2013 which I do for hours, every year! A vital part of the ecosystem and of our lives \u2013 definitely my No 1.

After making some radical suggestions to change one of my pieces, she singled out the improved version to be read aloud to my fellow budding writers.

This is our protagonist\u2019s family home. She is the highly travelled and skilled botanist Arabella Greene, and we walk in her footsteps around the great house and grounds. We know she is older \u2013 her walking sticks stand upright in the corners of rooms, there are plenty of chairs to rest on. We stumble upon letters from friends that drip with nostalgia for their shared youth, long gone. We never get too close to Arabella, but the game isn\u2019t really about her: it is about the plants that she loves so much, and the manor itself. Arabella\u2019s quest is simple, but fulfilling it is a delightful challenge. She must complete a compendium of the rare and unusual specimens she has discovered during her adventures, intended for publication. The game is set in the stark patriarchal culture of 1890 against which backdrop Arabella\u2019s success in her field holds great meaning \u2013 we are immediately rooting for her. (At one point we find a rejection letter from a university, on the grounds that Arabella is a woman whose place is in the home.) Filling this book with the details of rare and beautiful plants is the thin narrative thread that holds together the great set of puzzles that comprise the real makings of the game. The question players must answer is always: how do I make this weird plant grow? As we lead Arabella through interconnected set pieces, we discover how to bring the plants to life. They need humidity, heat, cold, wind, bursts of light, sound and smoke. The soil needs to be treated. Each location in the manor offers a veiled solution to bringing each plant up out of their pot, but getting to that moment of bloom is quite challenging. We collect clues \u2013 sometimes scientific charts, sometimes nursery rhymes about the kind of trees that grow in a specific forest, sometimes in cookbooks or on the backs of postcards \u2013 that lead us to the correct formula. There is much cross-referencing to be done, double checking posters on walls and notes sitting on tables \u2013 which means a great deal of traipsing back and forth across the manor in order to avoid mistakes. This never feels tiring though. The landscape of the game is colourful and well-lit. It is easy to feel a little lost, but never disoriented. There is nothing lurking in the shadows; Arabella is strangely alone, even as the fires roar and the kitchen burbles away. The manor isn\u2019t cluttered or overdecorated, as it easily could have been. There is a great balance and consideration to the space: it doesn\u2019t want to confuse the player, but it doesn\u2019t want to hand them easy solutions, either. The atmosphere is bright and hopeful. Botany Manor isn\u2019t a long game, but it is immersive and relaxing. There are fantastic, upfront accessibility options for players who struggle with the motion sickness that can often come with first-person gameplay. There\u2019s a classic feel to it: it has touches of Myst and The Witness, but none of their heaviness. The challenges are never too frustrating. It is a perfect two-night experience, a trip into a surprisingly sunny past, a story sprinkled with secrets that gently connect us to Arabella, but never weigh the player down. Though the story never lets us get too close to her, helping her to complete these measured, sophisticated puzzles is truly satisfying and restful.

In a warning shot to governments around the world, the IMF said attempts to increase innovation only worked under certain limited conditions and were not a \u201cmagic cure\u201d for slow growth. Era Dabla-Norris, the deputy director of the IMF\u2019s fiscal affairs department, said: \u201cHistory shows that getting industrial policy right can be a tall order, and there are many cautionary tales of policy mistakes, high fiscal costs and negative spillovers to other countries.\u201d It comes as leading western governments adopt an increasingly interventionist approach to boosting economic growth, gradually turning away from a reliance on the private sector, low taxes and the light-touch regulation built up over the past four decades. In a sign of increasing tensions over industrial policy, Beijing has accused the EU of protectionism after Brussels launched a subsidy investigation into Chinese wind turbine companies. \u201cChina is highly concerned about the discriminatory measures taken by the European Union against Chinese companies and even industries,\u201d the country\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. The EU\u2019s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, announced an investigation on Tuesday into whether Chinese companies involved in wind farms across Europe may have benefited from support from Beijing. While careful to avoid singling out any country for criticism, the IMF used a chapter from its half-yearly fiscal monitor to express scepticism about the benefits claimed for industrial strategies and urged rich countries to concentrate on support for underfunded basic research. It said recent initiatives \u2013 such as the Chips Act and Inflation Reduction Act in the US, the Green Deal Industrial Plan in the EU, the New Direction on Economy and Industrial Policy in Japan, and the K-Chips Act in Korea \u2013 as well as longstanding policies in large emerging market economies such as China were alike in having a strong emphasis on innovation in specific sectors. Most packages involve governments offering tax and subsidy incentives for investment in green and advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Dabla-Norris said the resurgence in industrial policy was motivated by concerns about economic and energy security, and the hope that it would re-ignite productivity growth, which has been weak in many parts of the world since the global financial crisis of 2008. Using industrial policy to promote innovation was only worth it if the benefits could be well identified and measured, and the subsidies were provided to sectors that generated higher knowledge spillovers to other sectors, Dabla-Norris said. Gains could be particularly high in the case of innovation that accelerated the development of green technologies to lower carbon emissions. However, she feared activist government policies could lead to \u201cmisallocation of resources and capture by special interests\u201d, because most approaches relied heavily on costly subsidies. \u201cPotential gains could quickly run into sizeable losses,\u201d she said. \u201cFurther, we show that discriminating against foreign firms can actually prove self-defeating, as such policies can trigger costly retaliation in most countries. Even major advanced economies rely on innovation that is done elsewhere.\u201d The IMF said in technologically advanced economies, a more cost-effective way to increase innovation and growth was a mix of public funding for fundamental research, research and development grants for innovative startups, and tax incentives to encourage applied innovation across firms. \u201cWe estimate that increasing spending on these policies by 0.5 percentage points of gross domestic product \u2013 or about 50% of the current level in OECD economies \u2013 could raise GDP by up to 2% for the average advanced economy. That level of spending on innovation could even reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over the long term.\u201d", "date": "2024-04-10", "section": "Business", "author": "Larry Elliott Economics editor", "id": 117, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1c8f5a51e6e07d9efb73df8cc2b0f62e61d4ce4e/0_345_6960_4176/500.jpg"}, {"title": "People in Ireland: what are your political hopes for new taoiseach Simon Harris?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/11/people-in-ireland-what-are-your-political-hopes-for-new-taoiseach-simon-harris", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.028, "neu": 0.575, "pos": 0.397, "compound": 0.9716}, "body": "Simon Harris has become Ireland\u2019s youngest taoiseach after the D\u00e1il elected him with 88 votes in favour of his appointment and 69 against.

Not only will it bring cleaner, more affordable and more secure energy to homes and businesses across the country, but a low carbon future also presents huge economic prospects for the UK, as well as jobs for future generations. Among those ready to take on the challenge is Jade Kimpton, 23, a substation apprentice for National Grid studying for a foundation degree in electrical power engineering. \u201cMany people from my generation have a keen interest in climate change and looking after our environment,\u201d says Kimpton, who is from King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk. \u201cI think my generation experiences more eco-anxiety than previous generations and this motivates a lot of young people to explore careers which can make a real difference.\u201d Key to making that difference is decarbonising the energy we use; moving away from fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. That means demand for skilled workers across the energy infrastructure, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and environmental conservation sectors is expected to soar. Over the next 25 years the energy sector needs to recruit for hundreds of thousands of roles, in what is fast becoming the country\u2019s net-zero energy workforce. From scientists and engineers to designers, ecologists and installers, there will be huge opportunities for the next generation of professionals. In the renewables sector, that means the creation of jobs in construction, maintenance, and operations across solar, wind and tidal energy. In energy infrastructure, roles will range from designing and building the infrastructure \u2013 such as overhead lines, underground cables and substations \u2013 that carries electricity from where it\u2019s generated to where it\u2019s needed, to coding the systems that manage and maintain the electricity network. And then there are also job opportunities in the conservation and restoration of natural habitats and ecosystems, such as in biodiversity management. At the frontline of this recruitment drive is National Grid, the company that builds and maintains the UK\u2019s electricity grid infrastructure. National Grid has ambitious plans to transform our energy infrastructure and make it fit for a future powered by renewable energy. It has launched The Great Grid Upgrade, the largest overhaul of the UK\u2019s electricity grid in generations, which will scale up the grid and make it fit for a clean energy future. These 17 major infrastructure projects will involve building new electricity infrastructure and updating old networks, with National Grid set to build five times more electricity transmission infrastructure over the next six years than it has constructed over the past three decades, reorienting the once coal- and gas-centric legacy system into a modern, renewables-oriented one. The Great Grid Upgrade\u2019s wide geographic scope means new jobs will be distributed across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a huge number of people to deliver the infrastructure needed to hit net zero,\u201d says National Grid\u2019s recruitment director Jenna Barnes. \u201cYou might think an engineering specialism is all that\u2019s required. But before we\u2019ve even put a spade into the ground, we need to think about ways of designing and building the grid infrastructure. So, we\u2019re looking for diverse and creative individuals to think about new ways of doing things in future.\u201d The nature and scale of these projects mean that the sector will require a range of new roles including people with the digital and data skills to maximise the reliability and accuracy of the UK\u2019s energy system as well as scientists, engineers and designers to deliver new technologies such as effective carbon capture, hydrogen gas, and to enable growth in new energy networks. \u201cWe also need people with change management skills, plus project managers, contractors, and quantity surveyors to help deliver the strategic infrastructure being developed as part of The Great Grid Upgrade,\u201d says Barnes. To help create this net-zero energy workforce, National Grid supports a number of early-careers projects, including its community investment programme Grid for Good, apprenticeships, internships and graduate programmes. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make a better, cleaner, greener future, and that\u2019s really important to a lot of people \u2013 especially younger generations,\u201d says Barnes. For Jade Kimpton, her apprenticeship has offered the chance to combine passion and purpose. \u201cI think everyone agrees that we need to work collaboratively to make sure the future is positive,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I love about my job, knowing that every day I am contributing to the bigger picture of tackling climate change. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed being outside in nature \u2013 and when we learned about sustainability in school, it was something that really interested me. My dad has worked in the energy sector for 44 years and hearing him talk about how everything used to be driven by coal-fired power stations, and how we\u2019re heading towards solar and wind energy, really piqued my interest.\u201d Kimpton hopes her apprenticeship will lead to a career as a commissioning engineer, helping to bring new-generation technology to the grid. \u201cFor young people like me, being part of the net-zero energy workforce means working towards delivering a clean, fair and affordable future,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing will benefit everyone.\u201d With passionate people like Kimpton applying their skills to the UK\u2019s net zero ambitions, Barnes is feeling positive about the path ahead. \u201cThe understanding that everybody can play a part in the future of our country is particularly appealing to young people,\u201d she says. \u201cWorking for the greater good leads to a sense of purpose and job satisfaction for everyone involved in the creation of a cleaner and more resilient energy system.\u201d Find out more about The Great Grid Upgrade here", "date": "2024-04-11", "section": "The Great Grid Upgrade", "author": "Rosie Mullender", "id": 119, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e5fa5061dfb3efef4e12d4ea448465d744e243d0/0_250_6334_3800/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Doing the heavy lifting in your 60s | Letters", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/apr/11/doing-the-heavy-lifting-in-your-60s", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.08, "neu": 0.714, "pos": 0.207, "compound": 0.9646}, "body": "What with running, high-intensity interval training, swimming, yoga and now resistance training too \u2013 how much time exactly is left for work, relationships and domestic chores?

Claim to have had vaginal rejuvenation surgery to encourage their hated girlfriend to get it so your friend can \u2013 of course \u2013 avoid having sex with her for the six to eight weeks during which he still needs her political influence? In Curb Your Enthusiasm, as the season finale made very clear, there was no hugging and absolutely no learning, a continuation of the ethos behind creator Larry David\u2019s previous show, Seinfeld. (\u201cI\u2019m 76 years old and I have never learned a lesson in my entire life,\u201d the fictional Larry told a child.) It ended with the core gang on a plane, bickering furiously over whether Susie Greene\u2019s open window blind counts as a \u201ccommunity shade\u201d. But in Curb, there were also no limits on the lengths to which this dysfunctional group of friends would go to help one another out of a fix, or even just in pursuit of a good wheeze, from mooting the viability of a car that runs on urine to starting quick-fix businesses that always backfired. The notion would probably make Larry sick, or at least strain one of those famous eyebrows, but Curb\u2019s legacy is as much about friendship as it is the most frivolous aspects of social intolerance. A typical day in the fictional Larry\u2019s life, 120 episodes of Curb told us, might involve meeting one friend for ice-cream, others for golf, someone for an errand hang and more for dinner; turning up unannounced at another\u2019s house and storing your cheese in their fridge then driving your housemate around late at night so he can graffiti an all-you-can-eat restaurant that does, in fact, limit how much you can eat. Of course, the fl\u00e2neur lifestyle is easily achieved when you\u2019re richer than Croesus and have no work to do and nowhere to be: the fictional Larry is still the co-creator of Seinfeld, which had earned more than $4bn in syndication by 2017 and was recently bought by Netflix for $500m. And more often than not, these engagements end in variously grievous shades of upset, or at the very least a gaudily clad Susie yelling: \u201cGetdafuckouttamyhouse!\u201d But despite Larry\u2019s gift for causing offence, these self-proclaimed social dyspeptics keep on meeting up with one another, and always reset after mortifying showdowns that would end in most of us Googling witness protection programmes. It seems like a dream to me: the social spontaneity (a rarity, living in a city like London where it often feels as if plans have to be made a minimum of five weeks in advance); having friends who are unafraid to lambast you for your idiocy but who never hold a grudge; the understanding that healthy arguments are the purest expression of familiarity; and in Larry\u2019s (utterly ineffectual) manager Jeff Greene and Kramer-style housemate Leon Black, stalwart sidekicks who will back you to the point of absurdity, taking a \u201cyes, and\u201d approach to mischief. The whole extended gang hangs out like a bunch of kids, not trying to achieve anything more than make each other spit-take or avenge some petty injustice. But these are characters in their 60s and 70s: ages when friendships can drop off \u2013 especially among men \u2013 but when staying curious and connected is proven to extend your quality of life. As a cameoing Bruce Springsteen, 74, taught us, it\u2019s never too late to learn what a \u201cfloor fucker\u201d is. The friendships in Curb also work on two layers: the dynamics within the series would never have succeeded if not for the profound connections between the actors in real life \u2013 the affection and trust that has stoked their improv genius over the past 24 years. You can tell it\u2019s real from how often they desperately try not to corpse even in the takes that made it to air. I don\u2019t know any other show that has looked so fun to work on and would happily watch hours of outtakes from each of the 120 episodes. Those connections became tragically vivid in February when comedian Richard Lewis \u2013 Larry\u2019s best friend on screen and in real life \u2013 died at the age of 76. Lewis was the show\u2019s sentimental heart and rawest nerve, laying his friendship on Larry with earnest, wild-eyed ferocity, almost as it if were a matter of life and death, as they competed to pay restaurant bills and outdo each other with the legacies they threatened to leave one another in their wills. In real life, Lewis would apparently regularly call his co-stars to lavish praise on their performances. Susie Essman, who played Susie, said he once left her a rambling 45-minute message to that effect; JB Smoove, who played Leon, said Lewis likened him to Jimi Hendrix, \u201cplaying this shit like a fucking guitar, man\u201d. For a show that based an entire season on Larry setting up a \u201cspite store\u201d to put an underwhelming coffee shop out of business, it had a sneaky generous streak. The final episode brought back another of real-life Larry\u2019s oldest friends as he faced trial for inadvertently breaking Georgia\u2019s (also real) Election Integrity Act in the previous season by handing a bottle of water to a waiting voter. Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s version of moral support came in the form of a pivotal sharp eye, but also an extended riff on whether either of them would date the most beautiful woman in the world if she also happened to have a beard. It\u2019s exactly the sort of pointless but funny nonsense that constituted much of their history-making first show together. Unlike Lar\u2019 and Jer\u2019, your own lovingly tended friendship digressions might not make you television billionaires with time to lunch (on your own eggs, obviously) at the golf club every day.

One is a half hearted interrogation of capital and power and their influence on art, told via millennial characters whose hubris and privilege speak of who wields control in creative industries. The other is a modern romance between two people with a mutual yet sparring love of art in a novel that mostly treats art and artists like a beguiling yet uninterrogated backdrop \u2013 like a painting in a restaurant. Lee\u2019s other works \u2013 the acclaimed Eggshell Skull and two follow-ups, Beauty and Who Gets to Be Smart \u2013 are each memoir-infused nonfiction, respectively tackling Australia\u2019s inadequate justice system for sexual assault and rape survivors, beauty standards and institutions, and correlations between privilege and knowledge. In her foray into fiction, Lee brings her familiarity with sociocultural issues \u2013 and parts of herself again, as she\u2019s mentioned \u2013 to The Work, using the lens of gender inequity, power and class to scrutinise the cultural sector\u2019s gatekeepers and profiteers. Whether the novel accomplishes this is another question. The Work, split between New York and Sydney, alternates between two characters: Lally, a career-focused thirtysomething American who is the owner of a contemporary gallery in Manhattan, and Patrick, an Australian bloke in his late 20s from regional Queensland now working as a junior appraiser at a prestigious antiquities company in Sydney. Both have worked hard for their success; both unconsciously lie to themselves about the certain privileges they enjoy (an \u201cunexpected inheritance\u201d, male privilege). The novel\u2019s tension stems from Lally and Patrick\u2019s relationship (they have a meet-cute through work, exchange flirty barbs, have a lot of sex) in tandem with their unfolding career mistakes. Lally, in her bid to feed \u201cwhat the market hungered for\u201d, commissions an installation by the controversial artist Chuck Farr, which she persists with despite historical allegations of coercion against him from several male models. Patrick, meanwhile, finds himself in a precarious position after having sex with his first major client, a divorcee looking to pawn off her former husband\u2019s assets. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Art isn\u2019t the focus of The Work; Lee herself says it\u2019s more about \u201creal estate\u201d. That\u2019s true, and the novel is most compelling when illustrating the market\u2019s ever-shifting perceptions of cultural value, our gendered ideals of creativity, and the machinery that distributes and profits from it. It\u2019s self-aware of performative currency in \u201cyoung and diverse\u201d artists \u2013 Lally bats no eyelid pushing the \u201cdevastated-migrant-son angle\u201d for a photography series \u2013 with the novel\u2019s characters attuned to the inequities of their industries while remaining complicit in upholding them. However, the novel\u2019s limp handling of art detracts from the plot. There are moments when it convincingly engages with its ethics and politics, such as when Lally contends with the moral ambiguity of Farr\u2019s provocative video works. But lazy obscurities creep in: Farr\u2019s work hits \u201cthat sweet spot in Lally\u2019s aesthetic-intellectual interior\u201d, and circular, platitudinous conversations abound. Characters also often refer simply to \u201cart\u201d, untethered from any medium or idea: \u2018Do most of your friends do other kinds of work?\u2019 she asked. \u2018You mean not-art?\u2019 \u2018Yes. There\u2019s art, and then there\u2019s everything else.\u2019 Are these satirical jabs at industry cliches or authorial flatness? Who knows. But as passion for artistic expression is seemingly the underpinning of Lally and Pat\u2019s budding romance, we\u2019re left a bit bored. Also, for such an unabashedly horny book \u2013 which Lee says is aimed at challenging the male-dominated canon of badly written sex \u2013 so much of its eroticism, though frank and explicit, veers into the comically stilted. We jump from jarring descriptions (breasts like \u201cpanna cottas\u201d) to prose deadened by anatomical specificity: \u201cShe grabbed his left hand, placed it on her breast, climbed onto him, and put his right hand on her arse.\u201d Lines like \u201cLally felt desperate to \u2026 get their physical in sync with their intellectual\u201d evoke all the sensuality of backing up your iCloud. In The Work, neither Lally nor Patrick face any real consequences for their sins. They don\u2019t need to, of course, but its function in the novel feels less a knowing wink towards the reality of the art sector than something simply elided for the sake of the love story. Indeed, the novel\u2019s bow-tied ending \u2013 admittedly culminating in an authentic depiction of a modern relationship \u2013 defangs any claim it may have had as a barbed skewering of money and power. Ultimately, this is a cleanly written if clunky romp seemingly aimed at \u201cgiving the market what it wants\u201d \u2013 a book trying to tick too many boxes.

The initial review, published in September, found that people should not expect the technology to have a positive outcome in the world at large. \u201cWe can\u2019t take a positive future for granted,\u201d Cardell said at the time. \u201cThere remains a real risk that the use of AI develops in a way that undermines consumer trust or is dominated by a few players who exert market power that prevents the full benefits being felt across the economy.\u201d The news came as AI regulators around the world prepare for a mini-summit in Korea, to build on the AI safety summit held in the UK in November 2023 and prepare for the full second session in Paris, expected later this year.", "date": "2024-04-11", "section": "Technology", "author": "Alex Hern Technology editor", "id": 124, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/67980410abd09325642c2927d3186d58e877d9fe/0_66_1280_768/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Coppola, Lanthimos, Sorrentino: Cannes\u2019 silverback gorillas shall slug it out at this year\u2019s festival", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/11/coppola-lanthimos-arnold-cannes-silverback-gorillas-shall-slug-it-out-at-this-years-festival", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.073, "neu": 0.701, "pos": 0.226, "compound": 0.9964}, "body": "The new Cannes selection has been unveiled in one of the most tense and fraught geopolitical situations for years, giving even more of a frisson to the traditional rune-reading activity of scrutinising the festival\u2019s list, and scrutinising cinema itself, for contemporary meaning. There is a very prominent Russian director in competition, Kirill Serebrennikov, with his film Limonov: The Ballad, starring Ben Whishaw as Russian opposition leader and poet Eduard Limonov, based on the novel by the veteran French author and public intellectual Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re. Of course, the point is that Serebrennikov is a notable anti-government figure. As far as the Gaza situation goes, there is an intriguing title in the Special Screenings sidebar: The Beauty of Gaza by French film-maker Yolande Zauberman, about a trans woman who travels from Gaza to Tel Aviv. And as we approach the US election, Ali Abbasi\u2019s film The Apprentice in competition mischievously tweaks the title of Donald Trump\u2019s famous TV show for a drama about his early years in New York real estate, with Sebastian Stan as young Trump, learning the dark arts of political bullying and manipulation from the notorious prosecutor and McCarthy-intimate Roy Cohn \u2013 played by Jeremy Strong, a mouthwatering bit of casting. As for the other traditional talking points, we have so far four women in the competition list: first-timer Agathe Riedinger with Wild Diamond, Mumbai film-maker Payal Kapadia with All We Imagine As Light, about a nurse whose life is thrown into disarray, Coralie Fargeat\u2019s body-horror shocker The Substance featuring Margaret Qualley and the final appearance by the late Ray Liotta, and Andrea Arnold\u2019s Bird, a UK-set drama of marginalised lives starring Barry Keoghan and Franz Rogowski. (The brilliant Zambian-Welsh film-maker Rungano Nyoni incidentally presents her new movie in the Un Certain Regard sidebar: On Becoming A Guinea Fowl.) Against that it\u2019s 15 men: a ratio that will continue to be found unsatisfactory in many quarters. Cannes has always countered this with the argument that its diversity resides in its internationalism, and the festival is furthermore still hanging tough against the streaming behemoths and still arguing for the big-screen experience, although as the Covid lockdown recedes into the collective memory somewhat, I sense this is less urgent. But no doubt about it \u2013 Thierry Fr\u00e9maux and the Cannes selectors take a pride in the huge Hollywood successes of last year\u2019s competition titles, Justine Triet\u2019s Anatomy of a Fall (the Palme d\u2019Or winner) and Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Oscar-winner The Zone of Interest. And the director and star of last year\u2019s colossal award winner Poor Things \u2013 Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone \u2013 are now back in competition with all-star anthology picture Kinds of Kindness. All Cannes watchers will be (in a spirit of exasperation or loyalty) looking out for the festival\u2019s silverback gorillas, the heavy hitters who come back year after year. None bigger, surely, than Francis Ford Coppola \u2013 a two-time Palme d\u2019Or winner now going for the triple \u2013 with his colossal self-produced passion project Megalopolis, a futurist sci-fi extravaganza perhaps inspired by Lang. Fr\u00e9maux has pointedly said it was an \u201chonour\u201d to include this film, perhaps a reproach to all the American distributors who have reportedly seen the film and made noises about how much they respect the great American film-maker but failed to put their money where their mouths are.

Tall and lanky, he is dressed in his signature black rehearsal jeans and T-shirt, black work boots on his feet, reading glasses hooked on his shirt neck. He approaches with open arms, as if he might hug, but settles for a warm handshake before a quick photoshoot. Passersby stop for a look. He is recognised, perhaps from his roles in The Lord of the Rings and The Matrix, but today at least, no one approaches him for a selfie. As we set out for a lunchtime stroll up and down the Walsh Bay wharves, I ask what he has been up to this morning. He has, he says, spent hours in the bath. \u201cLaughing and coughing in the bath.\u201d He is in rehearsal for The President, he explains, and his character is taking a bath offstage. \u201cThe president is having a bath and a massage during the first half of the play,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that\u2019s all I\u2019ve been doing this morning, laughing and coughing in the bath.\u201d The 64-year-old actor is just back in his Sydney home after 10 weeks in Dublin where The President played at the Gate theatre. Its cast is a mix of Irish and Australian actors \u2013 the play is a collaboration between the Gate theatre and Sydney Theatre Company \u2013 who are now being rehearsed into the show\u2019s Sydney premiere. Weaving takes on the role of a fictional dictator presiding over an unnamed country in which revolution is afoot. The first lady is played by one of Ireland\u2019s greatest actors, Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly challenging play,\u201d says Weaving. \u201cActually, it\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d You don\u2019t have to talk for long to see that Weaving has a restless mind. He takes a cerebral approach to acting, finding great pleasure in studying the meaning of each word, sentence and comma in the script. For The President, by Thomas Bernhard, he spent months reading everything the Austrian writer had written, anything he could get his hands on, translated into English from the German. Bernhard\u2019s a \u201ca real genius\u201d, he enthuses \u2013 his final novel, Extinction, \u201cone of the greatest things I\u2019ve ever read\u201d. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The President has been \u201cabsolutely massive\u201d to unpack intellectually, he says, because Bernhard is not in our theatrical tradition. \u201cIt\u2019s like when they first did Waiting for Godot in England in the 1950s. They didn\u2019t know what they were doing. They were flummoxed by it. It feels a little bit like that.\u201d It\u2019s an intellectual challenge Weaving eats up. *** As we walk around the finger wharves of Walsh Bay, the water lapping beneath us, Weaving reflects on an acting career that spans film roles such as the larrikin drag queen of The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, the \u201cuber villains\u201d of The Matrix Trilogy, V for Vendetta, and Captain America: The First Avenger, and Elrond, the Elven lord of Rivendell in Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings trilogy. It\u2019s been 30 years since Weaving donned a frock made of thongs in Priscilla. He celebrated the occasion with a pint of Guinness in Dublin, where the Gate theatre and the Irish Film Institute hosted an anniversary screening. \u201cPriscilla was a big thing in Ireland,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was great to see that it still means a lot to so many people. Back then, there was such repression of sexuality, the Catholic church was so strong. Ireland has changed radically, of course, but so many people told me what seeing Priscilla meant to them as young people. It was a life-changing event for some of them.\u201d It was for Weaving, too, and not only because it catapulted him from an actor working in Australian television and indie films to the international stage. \u201cI remember feeling like Priscilla was the crest of a wave of something. It was a celebration of family and identity, that it\u2019s OK to be who you are.\u201d And was it fun? \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he smiles. \u201cThe doing of it was more fun than any of us had ever had. Going out into that beautiful country, dressing up in frocks and being far away from home. Everyone went a bit mad \u2013 in a wonderful way.\u201d The film kickstarted Weaving\u2019s Hollywood film career. \u201cI know I got The Matrix as a result of Priscilla because the Wachowskis absolutely loved it,\u201d Weaving says. \u201cThey have both transitioned now, but they hadn\u2019t then. Priscilla meant a lot to them.\u201d The Matrix led to other villain roles. Weaving takes a cerebral approach to the bad-guy characters, too. He draws on plausible backstories for them, ponders their strengths and weaknesses. He uses his height to create a threatening stillness, lowers his raspy voice to provoke, and his expressive eyebrows to menace. \u201cVillains are fun,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut it got to the point where I thought each uber villain was going to bleed into the next. By the time I did Red Skull [the villain in Captain America], I was thinking \u2018that\u2019s enough of that\u2019.\u201d The same could be said after playing Elrond in The Lord of the Rings, and later The Hobbit. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the most satisfying character to play, to be honest. Elrond was a clothes horse and they gave me all the exposition!\u201d As we walk, the skies blacken. Heavy rain threatens. We retreat into the Sydney Theatre Company cafe in the nick of time. Weaving is big on walking, he says, bounding up the stairs with impressive energy. \u201cI don\u2019t drive, I walk. In Dublin, I walked about 35 minutes into the theatre each day because it was so cold. By the time I got there I was boiling.\u201d A voracious reader, he is drawn to complex texts, hence his continuing love of live theatre. Over a cup of tea, Weaving talks animatedly about the books and plays he\u2019s reading. It can be hard to keep up with his torrent of ideas and analysis. He\u2019s done a lot for STC in recent years: Samuel Beckett\u2019s Waiting for Godot and Endgame; Chekhov\u2019s Uncle Vanya, Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth and Brecht\u2019s The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, a production directed by the outgoing artistic director, Kip Williams. That, says Weaving, was a career highlight. Stage work is a necessary world away from the movies and green-screen studios. It is where Weaving feels most rewarded. \u201cI go into an extreme place when I\u2019m working in theatre. I can\u2019t work hard enough and there is never enough time, and then the rewards start coming with that.\u201d Audiences in Dublin embraced The President and Weaving often enjoyed adrink with the crew, cast or audience members after the show. \u201cIt was just thrilling,\u201d he says. After The President, Weaving plans several months of downtime at his property near Dungog in New South Wales. Typically he spends his relaxation time either planting trees \u2013 he likes to get his hands dirty \u2013 or reading challenging literature. He\u2019s just finished the Booker prize winner Prophet Song by Paul Lynch, and is now reading Nigerian-American writer Teju Cole. Once the schedule of the heavy world of the play is over, the pace will slow. It\u2019ll be time with his wife, Katrina, son, Harry, and daughter, Holly. Vegetable planting is on his mind. \u201cThe potatoes won\u2019t go in until August or September.

But while last year\u2019s tickets were all gone within four days, this year saw a slump in interest with 125,000 first weekend tickets taking 27 days to sell and some for weekend two still available. A pass for the first weekend costs $499, while a VIP pass goes up to $1,399. The underwhelming response comes after a record year for live music in the US. Live Nation, the entertainment company that owns Ticketmaster, reported its biggest ever year with more than 145 million fans attending more than 50,000 events, up 20% over 2022. Del Rey first appeared at the festival in 2014 and has teased what fans can now expect with her graduating to headliner. \u201cIf all goes well, it\u2019ll be as big and bold as I hope it will be,\u201d she said to Vogue. \u201cArchitecturally, it\u2019s going to depend on the structure, and whether I can make it \u2026 But I\u2019m really excited about it.

I enthusiastically responded with a photograph of the green orbs that were piled high in the crate in front of me. \u201cYes! You can get tomatillos here!\u201d They weren\u2019t imported from Latin America but growing on the farm in East Sussex where I work. This golf ball-sized fruit with light-green skin, encased in papery jackets has a tart, refreshing flavour and succulent texture. By that point (mid August), we were busy producing more than we could keep up with. I did my best to eat as many as I could and am fairly certain that I\u2019ll be coveting their tangy flavour every summer from now on. Tomatillos (Physalis philadelphica) can be started as early as March and sown until early May. Nurture their seedlings as you would tomato ones, potting them on as they grow until you\u2019re as certain as possible that the last frost has passed. They can be grown outdoors in the UK but do need a lot of sun and a sheltered spot to do well. Although tomatillos are a little hardier than their tomato cousins, the plants themselves aren\u2019t especially sturdy, so an exposed, windy spot would be disruptive for them. They thrive when grown with the added warmth and protection of a polytunnel or greenhouse (and this is likely the best approach if you\u2019re in a colder part of the country). Treat your tomatillo plants like a determinate (or bush) tomato, and allow them to ramble freely. There\u2019s no need to prune them \u2013 though given how fragile their branches can be, you may need to put some stakes or a structure in place \u2013 to support the plant as it grows and to keep the fruit off the ground. They will fruit abundantly as long as there are pollinating insects visiting their little yellow flowers, so two plants will provide you with as many fruits as one household can consume. Like all solanaceae family members, tomatillos appreciate an occasional feed (such as comfrey or liquid seaweed) to support their growth and fruiting. Their pollinated flowers will, at first, transform into a papery husk encasing a tiny fruit \u2013 much like a physalis, to which tomatillos are related. They are ready to harvest when the fruit has swelled to fill the husk or, better still, when it is pushing its way out and the husk has started to yellow. They can be stored for quite a few weeks, although split fruit are best kept in the fridge. Remove the papery husk and rinse off any sticky sap before preparing your tomatillos. While they\u2019re often eaten cooked, I love them raw \u2013 diced with a little chilli, pink pickled onions, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime to create something akin to a salsa which I greedily shovel into my face with tortilla chips.", "date": "2024-04-12", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Claire Ratinon", "id": 128, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b463a3ae6f4699bd9deb35d063c12b9a5258dce9/0_213_5400_3240/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018I want to bring the party up north\u2019: Nia Archives on unleashing a Yorkshire rave revolution", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/12/nia-archives-interview-music-silence-is-loud", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.051, "neu": 0.691, "pos": 0.259, "compound": 0.9994}, "body": "Nia Archives is a loud and proud junglist. When you dive deep into the West Yorkshire DJ, producer and singer\u2019s discography, you might assume she was around during the genre\u2019s mid-90s golden era. But being born in 1999 hasn\u2019t stopped her from being nostalgic for an era before her own. \u201cI love making the beats. I love making the drums. I\u2019ve always loved the chaos of jungle,\u201d she says. The 24-year-old\u2019s recent rise has largely been down to the way in which her songs capture the energy and euphoria of the genre without being considered derivative or pastiches. It\u2019s why drum\u2019n\u2019bass great Goldie refers to her as \u201cone of our own\u201d. Since bursting on to the scene in 2020 with the melodic and soulful Sober Feels single, which she self-produced and promoted using her student loan, Archives has released a string of critically acclaimed EPs and been dubbed by the New Yorker \u201cone of the brightest talents to emerge in the once again burgeoning field of drum\u2019n\u2019bass\u201d. She has gained respect far and wide, collaborating with supergroup Watch the Ride (consisting of DJ Die, Dismantle and DJ Randall) on the club banger Mash Up the Dance and seeing her remix of Jorja Smith\u2019s Little Things blow up on social media. Archives became the first electronic artist to be awarded the coveted BBC Music Introducing award for artist of the year, and opened for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2023 Renaissance tour in London. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was happening until the day,\u201d she says. \u201cI was anxious, but I was very grateful to be taking my underground genre to such a huge audience.\u201d Now she is about to release her debut album, Silence Is Loud. Not only is it her longest work yet, but it also serves as an evolution of her sound. The kaleidoscopic flair typical of an Archives recording is still there, but there\u2019s a new rawness and tenderness to her voice. \u201cI did a lot of the clubby stuff on earlier projects because I wanted to prove to people that I can produce. That I can make sick tunes,\u201d she says. \u201cI love rave music, but I don\u2019t necessarily listen to albums that sound like that. I love albums that tell stories.\u201d Listeners can still expect to hear high BPMs, deep synths and rapid breakbeats, but Silence Is Loud has more melody, alt-rock-inspired guitar riffs and passionate vocals. Archives has talked in past interviews of Amy Winehouse being a big inspiration, and you can very much hear it in her voice, while elsewhere there are nods to the Beatles, Blur and Natalie Imbruglia. \u201cI\u2019m a bit nervous, because the sounds are a bit different from what people are used to from me. But sometimes you\u2019ve got to take risks.\u201d We are chatting over a video call. Her camera is off because she\u2019s getting ready for an important meeting, so all there is to engage with is a black screen and a northern accent. It is rare but refreshing when talking to artists to hear a voice that sounds like mine. Archives was born in Bradford and raised, like me, in Leeds. She is half-Jamaican, half-English, and music runs deep throughout her family history. \u201cI used to go to church with my nana. We\u2019d always sing gospel.\u201d Her grandmother ran a pirate radio station in Bradford as well as a sound system that introduced Archives to genres such as dub and soul. So Archives is keen on affirming dance music\u2019s history within Black culture. In 2022, she wrote an open letter to call the Mobos out for not having an electronic/dance category (when they did finally introduce an award, she became its first winner). Why was she compelled to speak out? \u201cI wrote that letter honestly just as a bit of a nudge,\u201d she says. \u201cFor some reason in the past 10 years, people [don\u2019t] associate Black people with dance music. The Black community distances themselves from raving. I\u2019ve always found it so bizarre, because their parents were literally out at raves in the 90s. Funky house is Black music.\u201d Archives lives in London, but she is deeply proud of her northern heritage. \u201cA lot of people assume I\u2019m from London when they first meet me.\u201d That assumption is evidence of how London-centric the creative industries are. It\u2019s not often that you see Black working-class northern women receiving as much attention as she has. The north-south divide is something she is keen to dismantle: \u201cI\u2019m hoping in the next few years we see more northern creatives who are not just rich kids with parents who are going to pay for their gap year in London and their rent.\u201d Archives likes playing in London, but she loves playing up north: \u201cIt\u2019s about creating those opportunities and bringing those events to people that is not the norm for them.\u201d Once she\u2019s done with the album, she wants to do DJ, production and visual art workshops with working-class kids. \u201cI love working with people. It\u2019s one of the amazing parts of my job,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s definitely my future goal \u2013 to bring the party up north.\u201d Growing up there wasn\u2019t easy for Archives, however. \u201cIt made me who I am. But it\u2019s a tough place to come from.\u201d She lived in Horsforth, a little countryside town on the outskirts of Leeds; it was a very white area, and she and her brothers were the only Black kids in her school. She was told her musical dreams were unrealistic. Whether it was coming from a place of tough love or lack of belief, she was frequently advised to focus on getting a \u201creal job\u201d. \u201cBut I\u2019m a bit delusional,\u201d she says. She admits to having a weird relationship with Leeds today. Archives moved to Manchester by herself at 16, and although she has never explained exactly why, her track Family on the new album sheds light on some of her personal struggles. \u201cSeven years, I ask myself how this went on for so long,\u201d she sings. \u201cSometimes family ties do not always survive.\u201d Today Archives will not talk about her family. But what she does make clear is how she uses music to work through her feelings about them. \u201cWhen I started producing at 16, it was definitely my coping mechanism, just how I express myself. I\u2019ve always found it quite a healthy way to express happy emotions, sad emotions. I like that I can have really deep songs on jungle beats and people won\u2019t necessarily think I\u2019m being deep unless they are really listening. It kind of protects me a little bit. If I wrote a ballad, it\u2019s really [exposing].\u201d Music isn\u2019t all about processing her melancholia. Archives also sees her music as an expression of her Britishness. \u201cI am Black and I\u2019m half-Caribbean. But I am also just a British girl,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to make a quintessentially British record.\u201d Its artwork features a union flag because, says Archives, \u201cit\u2019s punk.

This film \u2013 which Peter Bradshaw called \u201ca complete toe-curling nepo vanity project\u201d \u2013 stars Ewan McGregor and his real-life daughter Clara. And on paper that sounds great. After all, every parent-child relationship is a complex cocktail of affection, antagonism and resentment, and that really should work gangbusters on screen. If you\u2019re going to bring baggage to a role, it may as well be the baggage that literally defines who you are. It is clear that, with Bleeding Love, this didn\u2019t happen. But don\u2019t think for a second that this is a one-off mishap signifying some grave fault on the part of the McGregors. Parent-child movies rarely work. Worst of all are the films, and you can spot them a mile off, in which a parent has deliberately elbowed room for their kid. Sunny Sandler, for instance, is a genuinely promising actor with a number of good films to her name. However, it\u2019s hard to truly judge her on her own merits given that every single film she has performed in has either starred or been produced by her father Adam Sandler. Similarly Maude and Iris Apatow would have a much better chance of convincing the world of their standalone talents if so much of their work hadn\u2019t been directed, produced or created by their father Judd Apatow or co-starred their mother, Leslie Mann. Will and Jaden Smith also deserve special mention since, in the two films they made together \u2013 The Pursuit of Happyness and After Earth \u2013 you can tangibly feel every atom of the heavy lifting Will is doing to carry Jaden. These films also fall foul of some of the other terrible things that can happen when parents and children star together. They\u2019re both unbearably indulgent, as if having his kid on board stopped Will Smith from being rigorous when it came to developing the material. And in the case of After Earth, the whole thing smells like the worst kind of vanity project. It looks to have been conceived by Will Smith, who has a story and producer credit, solely as a way for him to act alongside his son. And, boy, it shows. Which isn\u2019t to say such films never work, of course. Off the top of my head I can think of four very good films starring parents and their offspring that work for different reasons. The 2015 western Forsaken stars Donald and Kiefer Sutherland as an estranged father and son, and it works precisely because you can feel the real-life relationship in all its knotty complexity bleed in from the margins. There\u2019s a respect between the characters, but it\u2019s a snarling one, which drips with all sorts of unspoken indignation. Similarly, the strained and exasperated father-son relationship between Martin and Charlie Sheen feels extremely real in Wall Street. The other times the dynamic has worked has been when actors have deliberately diminished their relationship in service of a strong directorial voice. The most obvious example is Wild at Heart, where Diane Ladd and Laura Dern both threw themselves on the tracks for David Lynch. The other is Melancholia, which features Stellan and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd. Not only did both actors have to match their performances to the exacting demands of Lars von Trier but, interestingly, they didn\u2019t play father and son in it. Instead, Stellan plays the boss of Alexander\u2019s wife. They\u2019re just two guys working on the same movie. Also, while we\u2019re here, I\u2019m willing to cut some slack for any film where Brendan and Domhnall Gleeson work together, simply because they\u2019re great. There are other loopholes, too. If a child is too young to form memories when they appear in a film with their parents, for example, then this is more likely to be down to practicality than straight-up nepotism. Angelina Jolie got her daughter Vivienne to be in a few scenes of Maleficent, but only because Vivienne was said to be the only toddler who didn\u2019t burst into tears upon seeing Jolie in her wicked witch makeup. So that film gets a pass in a way that Tomb Raider, in which Jolie shared some truly terrible scenes with her father Jon Voight, does not. These films were all probably immense fun to make \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with their kid making movies all day? But that doesn\u2019t automatically make them good. If icky sentimentality is what you\u2019re aiming for, go ahead and do it. But if quality is your priority, maybe still try it \u2026 just remember that the film might be better if you\u2019ve cultivated a really horrible relationship with your parents first.", "date": "2024-04-12", "section": "Film", "author": "Stuart Heritage", "id": 130, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/659a243cca80128362500c930ecb43eaa3f68d59/411_139_2820_1692/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Franklin review \u2013 Michael Douglas is absolutely compelling in this period drama", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/12/franklin-review-michael-douglas-is-absolutely-compelling-in-this-period-drama", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.102, "neu": 0.68, "pos": 0.218, "compound": 0.9931}, "body": "You have to admire the chutzpah of Apple TV+. They\u2019ve chosen to make an eight-part miniseries out of the towering intellectual-slash-action figure of Benjamin Franklin \u2013 the son of a Boston candlemaker, who ran away to Philadelphia at 17 and rose to become one of the US\u2019s founding fathers, via polymathic stints as a printer, publisher, inventor, writer and scientist. And they\u2019ve based it on what was surely one of the least televisual accomplishments of his entire storied career. Franklin (whose eponymous hero is played by Michael Douglas) is adapted from the historian Stacy Schiff\u2019s 2005 book A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France and the Birth of America. It tells the story of the then 70-year-old statesman\u2019s unofficial eight-year-long series of negotiations with the Gallic great and good, beginning in 1776 as America\u2019s losses in the revolutionary war looked set to crush the young nation before it had fairly begun. Over to Paris hops Benjamin in the hope that the \u2013 well, let\u2019s call them longstanding contretemps \u2013 between the French and the English would help him persuade the former to provide money, weapons and other supplies to the beleaguered seekers after independence. His teenage grandson Temple (Noah Jupe) accompanies him \u2013 not his son, William, because he is a wellknown loyalist (and the less charming Frenchmen Franklin meets like to bring this shame up from time to time). Temple learns a lot about diplomacy and even more about fashion and fornication as he is taken under the wing of the Marquis de Lafayette (later to become a hero of r\u00e9volutions am\u00e9ricaine et fran\u00e7aise and more importantly, a star in Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s Hamilton), played by Th\u00e9odore Pellerin. Metaphors about seduction and chess abound as grandfather tries to keep the boy\u2019s focus on their real mission. Unfortunately for the viewer, that mission is composed mostly of meetings. Some more clandestine than others, but mostly in virtually indistinguishable chateaux with virtually indistinguishable French ministers and rich men. Those we do learn to pick out \u2013 such as the secretly sympathetic foreign minister Comte de Vergennes (Thibault de Montalembert) and the wealthy merchant Chaumont (Olivier Claverie), who decides to help fund US independence for the trading opportunities that would result \u2013 too often get sidelined by lesser characters. We spend too much time with the pawns in this monumental chess game, when we would really rather be concentrating on the alliances and treacheries among the main pieces. Franklin is dogged by the same slight but dreary sense of worthiness that attended Apple\u2019s other recent foray into US period drama, the meticulous Manhunt (about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the conspiracy behind it, and \u2013 almost as a distasteful afterthought \u2013 the capture and trial of his killer, John Wilkes Booth). This time, though, it doesn\u2019t even have the background pursuit of a murderer to keep things moving. Douglas is wholly convincing as the experienced but idiosyncratic statesman and 18th-century celebrity. And he has his usual undeniable presence (so compelling but always with a hint of creepiness at the edges). But Franklin himself was wearying by this point in his illustrious career and it feels as though we are concentrating on the wrong part of his astonishing story. And when Congress becomes frustrated with Franklin\u2019s perceived lack of progress and send John Adams (Eddie Marsan) over instead, Douglas/Franklin has to join le comte and Chaumont towards the sidelines too. Doubtless it plays slightly better in its native land, where Franklin\u2019s more immediately interesting and understandable accomplishments are better known. It probably feels more like a wrong being righted as an underacknowledged period of the national hero\u2019s life is given its due. Whether this is quite enough to bring the punters in and satisfy the expectations for entertainment they have \u2013 mostly rightly \u2013 come to expect from Apple TV+, I am not nearly so sure. \u2022 Franklin is on Apple TV+.", "date": "2024-04-12", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Lucy Mangan", "id": 131, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/106b2ff75033a66cdb2cc445b1e43c24ceb83e14/0_147_5767_3460/500.jpg"}, {"title": "After 101 years \u2013 and a $20 find at a yard sale \u2013 Clara Bow\u2019s lost film premieres", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/12/after-101-years-and-a-20-find-at-a-car-boot-sale-clara-bows-lost-film-premieres", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.078, "neu": 0.708, "pos": 0.215, "compound": 0.9986}, "body": "A century after she first began to turn heads, Clara Bow is \u201cIt\u201d once more. The iconic flapper of the silent film era inspired Margot Robbie\u2019s character Nellie in Damien Chazelle\u2019s Hollywood epic Babylon, is namechecked on Taylor Swift\u2019s forthcoming album The Tortured Poets Department, and yesterday at the San Francisco Silent film festival, one of her earliest films was shown for the first time since the days of bathtub gin. The story of the film\u2019s discovery has already caused excitement online. Film-maker Gary Huggins inadvertently snapped up a slice of lost silent film history at an auction in a car park in Omaha, Nebraska, that was selling old stock from a distribution company called Modern Sound Pictures. Hoping to bid on a copy of the 1926 comedy Eve\u2019s Leaves that he had spotted on top of a pile, Huggins was informed that he could only buy the whole pallet of movies, not individual cans. The upside? The lot was his for only $20. Huggins soon discovered that his new pile of reels included 1923\u2019s The Pill Pounder, a silent comedy that had been thought to be lost for decades. It is a short, two-reel film, shot on Long Island, New York, and directed by Gregory La Cava, best known for later classics such as My Man Godfrey (1936) and Stage Door (1937). The film stars rubber-faced vaudeville veteran Charlie Murray, the so-called \u201cIrish comedian\u201d who was actually from Laurel, Indiana. He plays a hapless pharmacist, the \u201cpill pounder\u201d of the title, who is trying to host a clandestine poker game in the back room of his drugstore. What few realised until Huggins watched the film, was that it also features 17-year-old Bow in a supporting role. She plays the girlfriend of Murray\u2019s son, played by James Turfler, who had already appeared with Bow in her second film Down to the Sea in Ships, directed by Elmer Clifton and screened in 1922. Turfler\u2019s character is the butt of some bizarre gags. At one point, he chugs a jug of effervescent \u201cfomo seltzer\u201d and Bow watches in horror as he floats up to the ceiling. In this, one of her earliest surviving performances on film, Bow looks even younger than her years. Although she lacks the sleek Hollywood glamour she later acquired, she has the charisma to turn a thankless bit-part into something of a scene-stealer. The critics took note: based on the evidence of this film, the Exhibitors\u2019 Trade Review described her as \u201cperhaps the most promising of the younger actresses\u201d. In his introduction to the film at San Francisco\u2019s grand Palace of Fine Arts theatre, Bow\u2019s biographer, the screenwriter David Stenn, speculated that the actor may have forgotten that she made the film, as she never talked about it. It was made during a traumatic period in her life, only a few weeks after her mother\u2019s death following prolonged mental illness. He invited us to imagine how Bow might have felt appearing in a lighthearted slapstick comedy in such circumstances. The film, which has been restored by the festival\u2019s organisers and was screened with accompanying music from composer Wayne Barker, now looks remarkably good for its age. The festival\u2019s senior film restorer, Kathy Rose O\u2019Regan, said it was in great shape when they received it. She added: \u201cWe imagined it was screened maybe a few times, but there\u2019s hardly any damage \u2013 a few scratches here and there, some dirt, but overall in pretty stellar condition.\u201d Now it has been freshened up and looks its best, but it is still incomplete, being in what Stenn called a \u201cbeta version\u201d. That\u2019s because the copy Huggins found was not from the 1920s, but a 35mm print from the 1950s or 1960s of an edit of the film that was destined to become part of a 16mm compilation of old silent films with a comic voiceover poking fun at its archaic aspects. The intertitles have been removed and there are a few scenes and shots missing, too. This process is deeply unflattering to old movies, but it has been responsible for preserving versions of silent films that would otherwise have been lost, including the Lois Weber melodrama Shoes from 1916. And the lack of titles are no barrier to following the film. \u201cFor me, it is a pretty perfect 14-minutes of fun,\u201d says O\u2019Regan. \u201cIt would be nice to know what the titles were, but you can certainly get the gist without them.\u201d Stenn called the tale of the film\u2019s discovery \u201cmiraculous\u201d and led a round of applause for Huggins, who was in the audience. He explained that there was reason to believe that some of the discarded material was among the other cans that were sold at the Omaha auction. The hunt is on to round out The Pill Pounder, and several people have joined in the search, combing through thousands of reels. One Omaha-based film-maker and silent film enthusiast, Alexander Payne, was quick to offer his support. The film fills in a brief blank period in Bow\u2019s filmography. She shot the role \u2013 probably in just a couple of days \u2013 in the early \u201cfalse start\u201d phase of her film career. Bow, a tomboy from a troubled home in Brooklyn, made her debut after winning a magazine talent competition in 1921 but struggled to get her career off the ground. \u201cI wore myself out goin\u2019 from studio t\u2019studio, from agency t\u2019agency, applyin\u2019 for every possible part,\u201d she later recalled. \u201cBut there was always something. I was too young, or too little, or too fat. Usually I was too fat.\u201d In 1923, she found her way into a handful of films, including The Pill Pounder, where she had the chance to shine in supporting roles, and this is when she finally got her ticket to Hollywood and Paramount. \u201cShe\u2019s not the star of the film, but you can\u2019t take her eyes off her,\u201d says O\u2019Regan. \u201cFor the few minutes she\u2019s there she\u2019s divine, she\u2019s fun, she\u2019s full of energy.\u201d The festival screened The Pill Pounder alongside another new restoration. The feature film Dancing Mothers directed by Herbert Brenon in 1926, is a flapper drama that Bow made for Paramount, in one of her last supporting roles. She plays the reckless daughter of a lonely woman (Alice Joyce) who tires of staying home while her husband and daughter party hard in New York and steps out to go nightclubbing. Bow completely pulls focus from the grownups around her, playing a hedonistic minx, whose body spasms with pleasure when she sips a cocktail. Stenn described the later film as \u201clike watching a star being born\u201d. Finally, Bow was able to make good on her early promise and start her career as a leading lady. With the breakout comedy It directed by Clarence Badger in 1927, she became a genuine star for the ages. It is easy to look back and assume Bow was destined to become a sensation, but her overnight stardom took a good five years of hard work. The Pill Pounder offers a fascinating glimpse into the route that she took to get there.", "date": "2024-04-12", "section": "Film", "author": "Pamela Hutchinson", "id": 132, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b72439365d6d5c27f6758f45f2a5c7a7e5128133/0_252_3661_2196/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018I end up hugging complete strangers and crying\u2019: inside the epic episode that might change Bluey forever", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/12/bluey-the-sign-joe-brumm-episode", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.699, "pos": 0.251, "compound": 0.9997}, "body": "Bluey is an absolute phenomenon. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s biggest TV shows, an Emmy-winning behemoth so popular that it accounts for nearly one-third of all TV views on Disney+. Last year, the family-friendly animated series was the second most-streamed show on any platform, behind only Suits. For its creator, Joe Brumm, though, there\u2019s one particular accolade that\u2019s really earned him bragging rights. \u201cRyan Gosling\u2019s a Bluey fan,\u201d he grins. \u201cTo my wife\u2019s eternal joy.\u201d Now Bluey is about to get even bigger. Despite the adventures of the cartoon dog and her family having won over the world with episodes that are a snappy, child-friendly seven minutes in duration, the show is about to launch its first ever extended special, The Sign \u2013 Bluey\u2019s longest outing by far at 28 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a risk,\u201d says Brumm, \u201cbut we\u2019ve worked hard to make sure it doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome.\u201d Might it pave the way for Bluey: The Movie? Could the hound from Brisbane be heading to Hollywood? \u201cIf there\u2019s riots in the street and kindergartens, maybe not!\u201d says Brumm. \u201cI love the idea of doing something even longer, so we\u2019ll see how this goes down. Maybe a movie, who knows? This is a good way to test the waters.\u201d It\u2019s a level of ambition that feels right for a show such as Bluey. The joyful, funny anthropomorphic escapades of the seven-year-old blue heeler pup have been widely lauded for their boundary-pushing ambition. Our snapshots of Bluey\u2019s life with her mother Chilli, father Bandit and little sister Bingo in the Queensland capital\u2019s suburbs are a heartfelt portrayal of domestic life and celebration of the magical power of play, forever shooting off in unexpected directions. Bluey is also no stranger to branching out. Since launching on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 2018 \u2013 before being picked up by the BBC and Disney \u2013 it has spawned bestselling books, chart-topping albums, video games, live stage shows, theme park attractions and all manner of merchandise. As a result, the franchise is now worth an estimated $2bn. The plot of The Sign is a closely guarded secret, but rumours are rife in advance of its premiere. Bluey subreddits and fan podcasts are feverishly suggesting it could feature a birth, death or house move. There\u2019s speculation about surprise guest voices from Margot Robbie to Hugh Jackman, from the Hemsworth brothers to the Minogue sisters (Kylie and Dannii recently read a Bluey storybook on YouTube). There are even fears that it could be a farewell episode before the beloved show goes on hiatus. Brumm is wary of spoilers but hints we\u2019ll hear wedding bells. \u201cWhen I was busy writing season three, ABC mentioned the idea of a special. I think I\u2019m allowed to say it\u2019s a wedding episode. If you think of Bluey as a sitcom, they all have a wedding episode, so I fancied a crack. The idea lodged in my head and the story grew from there.\u201d One thing we do know is that Hollywood star Joel Edgerton will make his Bluey debut, following in the footsteps of famous Bluey fans Natalie Portman, Eva Mendes and Lin-Manuel Miranda who have lent their voices in cameo roles \u2013 and Rose Byrne, who appears regularly as Aunt Brandy. The episode is also likely to feature Patrick Brammall, best known for acclaimed romcom Colin from Accounts \u2013 given that the prime candidates for any nuptials are Bandit\u2019s elder brother Radley [voiced by Brammall] and his spaniel girlfriend Aunt Frisky. \u201cPat and Harry [Colin from Accounts\u2019 co-creator, co-star and Brammall\u2019s real-life wife Harriet Dyer] deserve all the plaudits they\u2019re getting,\u201d says Brumm. \u201cThe success of both our shows overseas is something for Australia to be proud of. Funny how they\u2019re both about dogs. There\u2019s even a little mention for Bingo and Bandit in their show, if I remember rightly.\u201d Fan forums have interpreted The Sign\u2019s title as a hint that big changes are coming for the Heeler family. \u201cThe stakes are a little higher,\u201d confirms Brumm, trying his best to be cryptic. \u201cCharacters have to wrestle with things. Hardcore fans will enjoy spotting little elements from previous episodes popping up. The overall theme is that you never know where something will lead. Hopefully there will be tears and laughter. It definitely made most of our crew cry.\u201d The laid-back 46-year-old laughs. \u201cAlthough once you become a parent, you tend to cry at the drop of a hat anyway.\u201d His waggy-tailed hit is heavily Brit-influenced. After studying animation back home on the Gold Coast, Brumm moved to the UK. He worked briefly on Ben &amp; Holly\u2019s Little Kingdom and was an animator on CBeebies favourite Charlie and Lola. \u201cI learned so much in London,\u201d he recalls fondly. \u201cI imbibed their methods, many of which I ended up using on Bluey. Working in Soho Square with some of the best people I\u2019ve ever met, all fired up, doing something we loved and getting drunk together on Friday nights. I get misty thinking about it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just British children\u2019s TV that inspired Brumm. One grown-up sitcom played a part. \u201cGavin and Stacey was influential in a big way,\u201d he says. \u201cI loved how it genuinely crossed generations, like The Simpsons back in the day. I thought: \u2018Why shouldn\u2019t a kids\u2019 show make parents laugh too?\u2019 When the time came to do Bluey, that became the challenge.\u201d Brumm returned to his native \u201cBrissie\u201d in 2010, established a small animation studio and set about creating his own show. He envisaged it as an Aussie take on Peppa Pig, porcine stablemate of Ben &amp; Holly, and soon settled on blue heelers, a local breed of cattle dog, as his primary characters. \u201cWhat I liked about Peppa Pig was that it felt really English but without cliches or flag-waving,\u201d he explains. \u201cMr Bull would be digging up the road and say: \u2018It\u2019ll be finished when it\u2019s finished.\u2019 There are canal boats and castles in the background. That\u2019s what I wanted my show to do \u2013 to feel Australian but not with kangaroos and koalas, just by capturing the fabric of everyday life.\u201d Crucially, he tweaked the personality of his family patriarch: \u201cDaddy Pig makes me laugh but I couldn\u2019t do another goofball dad.\u201d Instead, Brumm made the show a celebration of imaginative role-play, with Bandit a fully engaged, endearingly daft participant. \u201cThe show grafted closely to the games I was playing with my own kids at the time. That became the fodder for early episodes. I\u2019d be the dunderhead or the tyrant within the game but, when I needed to, I could step out of the game and be a good dad. Bandit is an idealised version, like me on my best day, but the way Bluey demonstrates the very real benefits of play is one of the things I\u2019m proudest of. Play can facilitate genuine growth \u2013 socially, emotionally, developmentally. I hope that\u2019ll be a positive legacy of the show.\u201d Bandit won Father of the Year in 2019 and is credited with changing male attitudes to parenting. On a Facebook group called \u201cBandits: The Bluey Group for Dads\u201d, 86,000 members swap tips on how to deal with their own young pups. \u201cBandit becoming a role model was a surprise but he\u2019s a good dad, so I\u2019m pleased,\u201d says Brumm. \u201cHe\u2019s hands-on, playful and loving. He\u2019d do anything for his family. He works hard. He can be tired and impatient but he\u2019s courageous and faces up to his own mistakes. They\u2019re a fine set of values to emulate.\u201d Does Brumm hear from fathers who\u2019ve been inspired by Bandit? \u201cA lot, actually. I get emotional letters. A very common response is: \u2018It showed me a different way that I can be a parent.\u2019 Often it\u2019s a dad who didn\u2019t have a great role model himself growing up. Bluey\u2019s a funny little cartoon about a dog family but it\u2019s become a touchpoint for people. Whenever I appear at an event, I end up hugging complete strangers and crying together.\u201d Global success has been full of surprises for him. \u201cIt happens in ways you\u2019d never imagine, like the Thanksgiving balloon [a four-storey inflatable Bluey bobbed through Manhattan as part of Macy\u2019s 2022 Thanksgiving Day parade]. I never expected to sit in Madison Square Garden watching the premiere of Bluey\u2019s Big Play. I never dreamed of winning a Bafta. Because my whole career started in the UK, that was like 50 Oscars to me. It\u2019s immensely satisfying, especially when I think back to when we started out. We didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d even finish the first episode. It was quite possibly going to land me in debt or in jail. Whenever I\u2019m getting a bit immune to Bluey\u2019s success, I put myself back there and I\u2019m like: \u2018Man, you did it.\u2019\u201d Every Bluey fan has favourites among the 150+ episodes so far.

In fact, he admits , he had \u201ca few stigmas associated with cheerleaders\u201d. What he learned that day surprised him. \u201cI loved the energy, the connection between people,\u201d he says. It kickstarted a fascination that would take him around the world to capture a sport on the cusp of global popularity, a project that took him from the markets of Ho Chi Minh City to the tunnels of Lagos stadium. Cheerleading has long been associated with high school movies and glittery sideline entertainment, but it has a rich history \u2013 one that has fascinated me since I cheered at high school in the 90s. My master\u2019s thesis was an ethnography of cheerleading, following a squad throughout a season. For my doctoral dissertation, I wrote a cultural history of the sport. Cheerleading began in the US in the late 19th century, growing out of the civil war and finding a place among the sidelines of elite all-male higher education institutions. There were almost no women cheerleaders until men went to war in the 40s. In the latter half of the 20th century it was feminised and sexualised, before evolving into a competitive athletic endeavour of its own as a result of second wave feminism. It has since been further democratised and radicalised \u2013 there are squads of all ages and genders, advocating for all manner of social justice causes. No longer constrained to the sidelines of other players\u2019 games, cheerleaders now take centre stage, competing for medals in routines of two and a half minutes that consist of stunts, jumps, tumbling, dancing and cheering. The latest variation is known as all-star cheer: athletes divorced from any other sport, who cheer for one another and, ultimately, themselves. Soon Olympic gold may be on the line. In 2004, the International Cheer Union (ICU) was recognised as the worldwide governing body for cheerleading. With 119 National Cheer Federations and 10 million athletes worldwide, it shows a global demand and popularity within a formalised, scorable system \u2013 all-important criteria for Olympic consideration. The International Olympic Committee recognised cheerleading as a sport in 2021, an important distinction that may one day lead to official Olympic status. The ICU offers training and certification for coaches \u2013 of particular importance in places such as Azerbaijan, Ivory Coast and Mongolia, where cheerleading is less common.

Above: members of Athens\u2019 Amazons cheerleading team practise in the seaside suburb of Vouliagmeni For Sinibaldi, this meant he could travel the world in pursuit of new cheer communities. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in how photography can be used as a tool to talk about communities and people,\u201d he says, \u201cso the sport in this case is an excuse for me to talk about how young people are helping each other to grow.\u201d Vietnam\u2019s Saigon Beast team, which formed in 2017 and came third in the Asia Cheerleading Invitational Championships that year, has grown from just six members at the start to 20 today. Husband and wife coaches Hung and Trang Le are self-taught, spending hours on YouTube learning techniques and practising choreography. She is a real estate agent and he works part-time in marketing and event management, while trying to move to full-time coaching. Cheerleading is the couple\u2019s passion and special bond \u2013 they create everything, from the costumes to the stunts and routines, and dedicate all their spare time to the team. Sinibaldi captured the squads both in and outside of their typical practice spaces: in one of the oldest parts of Ho Chi Minh City; the streets of London\u2019s Soho; a market in Lagos where he involved so many local people to help him stop the traffic that he earned himself a nickname that roughly translates as \u201cthe special one\u201d. The shoots weren\u2019t without their dangers; Sinibaldi recalls a cheerleader falling on his head during one. Competitive cheer, with its heightened focus on stunting and tumbling, can lead to injury: concussions, broken bones and sprained ligaments are common. Whether he was in Athens in Greece or Astana in Kazakhstan, cheerleaders talked to Sinibaldi about teamwork. \u201cEverybody was saying that you might see the flyers performing this incredible stunt,\u201d he says of those at the top of a pyramid or being thrown into the air, \u201cbut obviously they would be nothing without the base.

Over the last decade, the Melbourne singer-songwriter has flitted from gentle storytelling to something a little weirder and more experimental. There was the folksy world of her debut, 2012\u2019s My Little River; her following two albums added more texture and reverb, and a bit of jangle to boot. Central to it all is Ribeiro\u2019s voice, which conveys worlds of emotion through its unadorned honesty. Straddling these two modes, Summer of Love is Ribeiro\u2019s first album in half a decade. Its carefree title belies its often sombre lyricism, relaying Ribeiro\u2019s ennui in the face of modern life. At times, the songwriting and delivery on this record recalls another Melbourne great, Sarah Mary Chadwick. On opener Maybe if I Wore Sunglasses Inside I Won\u2019t Feel Tired, Ribeiro shares Chadwick\u2019s raw despair; her vocals almost take on a monotone against sparse piano backing. Repetition drives her point home about the mundanity of existence: \u201cOh, another day, another day, another day \u2026\u201d The foreboding restlessness in these songs is offset by an affinity for the natural world \u2013 a sense of acceptance and living in the present. Bucolic images flood the tracks Everything is Now, The Trees and Me, and the gentle, largely acoustic love song Paradise, all pondering how nature can become a salve for our contemporary anxiety. \u201cMy heart is opening,\u201d Ribeiro sings sumptuously on The Trees and Me \u2013 then, later in the song, when she implores the listener to go outside and walk barefoot in the dew, the perspective flips: \u201cYour heart is opening again.\u201d Her voice is barely a whisper, but contains comfort and hope all the same. These symmetries recur. The same image of children frolicking closes both Helicopter and Wake in Fright, two sonically very different songs \u2013 the former an atonal and discordant experimental soundscape, the latter soft and saxophone-drenched. \u201cChildren play, night and day \u2013 don\u2019t forget them,\u201d she intones over a chaotic wall of noise on Helicopter; meanwhile, on Wake in Fright, \u201cchildren play in the darkest hours, don\u2019t forget\u201d, before the saxophone drifts off into a warm sonic blanket. The innocent perspective endures in both \u2013 it suggests hope, or maybe even healing. Much of Summer of Love\u2019s power also lies in its instrumentation, and how it builds. The title track begins simply, and details are slowly filled in \u2013 a fizzing violin tremolo eventually swells into a full string arrangement. Those strings adopt a different shade on Helicopter, where their harsh application contrasts the soft balm of Ribeiro\u2019s voice \u2013 a reminder of life\u2019s strange dualities. Closing track Howl is introduced over pulsing keys before growing to include choral accompaniment, then blooming into a two-minute instrumental outro: those discordant strings and tremolos again, this time as a hushed echo. It\u2019s all cyclical; Ribeiro\u2019s voice fades out and leaves only this contemplative whirring. Summer of Love isn\u2019t an album that hits you in the face: on first listen, many of these songs are unassuming. But listen closer and you\u2019ll notice the careful patterns, the resonances and mirrors. With these songs, Ribeiro communicates something sublime \u2013 a record of our anxious times, with a dash of optimism for a better future.

On occasional visits to Edinburgh, I\u2019d always been taken by that beautiful stretch north of Newcastle, where the North Sea sidles up and the train seems to skirt the cliff edge, travellers looking up from books and phones, and crossing the carriage aisle to take in the view. The estuary, the town and the beach \u2013 it always seemed as if the passengers wanted the train to slow, then stop, so that we might clamber down and walk to the shore. Perhaps not all the passengers, but I certainly did and there seemed to be no reason why this couldn\u2019t be achieved. I looked up the spot on the map, bought a guidebook to the Northumberland Coast Path, measured out distances and put aside four days. I bought new boots and socks, Ordnance Survey maps and an unnecessary compass, because how do you get lost on a coast walk? I bought roll-up waterproofs and dense, futuristic protein bars and too many novels, and on a bright, sharp day in the early summer of 2014, set out, catching the first departure from London to Newcastle, changing for Alnmouth, walking to the shore, then turning left and heading towards Berwick. It sounds, I realise, like a textbook reaction to middle age, with that obsessive and eccentric quality, a need to achieve something measurable and definable. As midlife missions go, it wasn\u2019t even that impressive or ambitious, hardly the Camino de Santiago or Everest; walking, not running, an almost marathon. Neither was this some new-discovered passion. I\u2019ve been going on long walks for most of my adult life and my children have happy and less-than-happy memories of hikes across fells and moors in rain and snow. The only features that marked out this journey were the distance and the solitude. I had never walked so far nor spent so much time alone. This was new. Four days of walking, four days of thinking. My father had died the previous August after a period of illness that had stretched into years, the complications and conditions accumulating with each month. It was a relationship that still felt unresolved, though it was hard to imagine what that resolution might have looked like, or how walking and thinking might help. If anything, thinking was the problem: overthinking, circular thinking, the pressure of work and the demands of parenthood, of getting older and stiffer. Stuck, distracted, perpetually exhausted yet unable to sleep, prone to gloom, introspection and withdrawal, to catastrophising and protracted silences. \u201cCrisis\u201d can seem like a melodramatic word for the familiar, predictable preoccupations of midlife, especially when, to an outside eye, things seem to be going well. Work to do and happiness at home; to someone whose life is in turmoil, there must be a kind of luxury in feeling merely \u201cstuck\u201d, and there was no reason to imagine that walking farther than usual might help, or that solitude rather than conversation was the answer. And yet once planned, the journey felt like a compulsion. At the very least, if I walked for long enough I might actually sleep. And that first walk was wonderful, those vast, unpopulated beaches with castles on the skyline at Dunstanburgh and Bamburgh. I walked all day and stayed the night in pubs and small hotels, eating fried food alone and reading conspicuously (\u201cWho is that mysterious traveller?\u201d), slept well and ate kippers for breakfast, the taste my companion for the day. It rained, of course, late spring squalls, and the latter stages were dull \u2013 fine golf courses make for terrible hiking \u2013 but I loved the ancient paths, St Cuthbert\u2019s and St Oswald\u2019s Way, taking a diversion off the official route to pad bare-footed across low-tide sands to Holy Island. I sound like a tourist, I know, with this talk of barefoot pilgrimages and castles in the mist; but I grew up in a southern suburb with no car and no trip north of Milton Keynes until I was 18. There must have been ancient history in my home town, too, but it had long since disappeared beneath housing estates and shopping arcades and light industrial zones, so that the English countryside, the real thing, seemed like another country. I can\u2019t imagine that I was ever more than 200 metres from another human being and so this lonely landscape still felt relatively new, particularly on that eerie, three-mile walk across the wet sands on the Pilgrim\u2019s Way, following the poles and passing the refuge huts high \u2013 high enough? \u2013 on their stilts, reassuring myself that I\u2019d checked the tide tables, had plenty of time before the sea crept over my ankles, but hurrying on nonetheless. I dried my feet in the grass, walked a circuit of the island, took the causeway back, and on the afternoon of the fourth day, caught the train home from Berwick. Traditionally, this is where I report some transformation, an insight or sense of resolution. A pilgrimage changes the pilgrim and has a purpose and destination other than a distant railway station, and nothing much had altered, not my feelings about my father\u2019s death, not my regrets or anxieties. No inspiration or great unblocking of emotion, none of the traditional epiphanies, just a pleasant feeling of exhaustion from exertion rather than insomnia, and a suntan solely on the right side of my face. I\u2019d never been alone for that long in my life and apart from brief calls home and ordering in the pub, I\u2019d spent the days either in silence or muttering to myself about the rain. I am not an antisocial person, have colleagues, friends and family whose company I treasure, and would go so far as saying I have a dread of loneliness that has found its way into everything I write. A long, solo journey should have been a trial and yet I was determined to do it again as soon as possible, and have done it every year since, sometimes twice a year. Distance and solitude, a long walk alone. * * * The conditions are always the same, a hike of 60 to 90 miles in early spring or autumn. The paths are well-trodden and unadventurous, taken from a list of routes that end in \u201cway\u201d: the Dales Way, the Cumbria Way, the Dales High Way, the Cleveland Way, the South Downs and Peddars Way, the Ridgeway. I always carry my own rucksack and have never for even one moment considered a tent. Pubs are favoured over B&amp;Bs and I\u2019m now quite comfortable with the smell of beer at breakfast. My diet is a nutritionist\u2019s fever dream of cheap bacon, sweets and crisps, fish and chips, salt and vinegar, so that I\u2019m in a permanent state of dehydration, justifying the calories by the astronomical step-count. \u201cWalking quite some way\u201d is unlikely to be recognised as a sport but it\u2019s the nearest I\u2019ve got to competence in a physical activity and while I like to think there are people who might come with me, being alone allows me to be quite insufferable, boring only myself with maps and routes and schedules, free of the need to make jokes or conversation, or apologise for the weather or the clouds obscuring a view as if they were my fault. I\u2019ve developed preferences, too, the kind of wild, provocative opinions that alienate other hikers, like slagging off a favourite band. Northumbria and Cornwall aside, I don\u2019t like coastal walks. The Dales High Way is far superior to the Dales Way. I have no love for the South Downs. There, I\u2019ve said it. And I try not to look at my phone but there are other ways in which I wonder if I\u2019m quite \u201cin nature\u201d enough. Rather than the song of the pipit or the wind in the heather, I listen to music, often for hours, strongly flavoured playlists of Kate Bush and Joni, Can and Sondheim and the 20-minute prog rock tracks I loved at 15; music that can clear a room in minutes but which I find comforting, like some terrible foodstuff you associate with childhood but wouldn\u2019t dream of offering to anyone else. Picture me, thirsty and wet on some desolate moor, high on glucose and listening to The Kick Inside with 12 miles still to go. The dream. At other times, I \u201cread\u201d while I walk. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to adapt some of my favourite novels into screenplays, the first stage of which is to absorb the book, learning its structure and dialogue, something best achieved on the move, listening while I walk, then returning to the beginning and listening again like an actor learning lines. Five hundred pages is roughly 50 miles and now Dentdale will always sound like Patrick Melrose; the Thames Path like Great Expectations. But I think there has always been a connection in my mind between literature and landscape, beginning with a childhood preference for books with a map at the front, tracking the characters\u2019 progress as if they were really there, like some kind of pre-digital satnav. For a kid who rarely travelled farther than school or the library, I was thrilled by the urgent flight across Europe in The Silver Sword and later loved the improbably long journeys in Victorian novels as characters fled their desperate circumstances. To open the door, walk out and keep going; it was such an appealing idea, that combination of freedom and peril, and I particularly loved the young David Copperfield\u2019s trek from London to Dover, his courage and vulnerability along the way. Dickens himself was an obsessive walker, claiming speeds of 4mph, walking briskly in search of inspiration or, once, as an escape from domestic turmoil, setting off at night to walk from Tavistock Square in Bloomsbury to Gad\u2019s Hill in Rochester, the first leg of Copperfield\u2019s walk, too. At just under 30 miles, I\u2019ve considered it myself, though the thought of the A207 at five in the morning means I\u2019m unlikely to set out any time soon. But if any author fuelled this desire to walk and walk, it was Hardy. The Bront\u00ebs\u2019 landscape was wild and dramatic but distant and unknown to a southern suburban boy. \u201cHardy\u2019s Wessex\u201d was not so far away, my home town squeezing unmarked on to the eastern edge of the map in Penguin editions, that strange parallel realm where Dorchester is Casterbridge but Southampton remains stubbornly Southampton. I\u2019d been on day trips to Bournemouth/Sandbourne, where Tess stabs Alec, and on book-buying trips to the WH Smith in Winchester/Wintoncester, where she meets her terrible fate, though not in Smith\u2019s. Casterbridge was too far away to recreate those journeys. Where could I go if I walked out my door? I was experimenting with ornithology at the time, lugging immense cast-iron binoculars along the local riverbanks, through business parks and new-build estates, alongside the railway yards, shadowing the commuter line to Basingstoke and Woking, walks that were only fitfully scenic, the hum of the M3 never far away. I was an inept and complacent birdwatcher, easily satisfied with moorhens and wagtails, but these nature walks felt bookish and learned, the kind of thing a writer might do. I read the Romantics, too, disappointed at the lack of romance, stuff about girls. Instead, they wrote about the sublime, nature as a living thing, the power of a landscape to transform and inspire. Perhaps this scrappy, un-sublime, municipal landscape would transform and inspire me. I liked David Attenborough, O-level Biology and early Genesis, was practically a nature poet already, and while I don\u2019t think I actually wrote any poetry, I wouldn\u2019t have put it past me, Keats by way of Adrian Mole. Distance and solitude. It was, looking back, eccentric to be wandering lonely at an age when sociability and popularity are at a premium, and I did have good friends, more than might be imagined from the above, but no one who wanted to spend the weekends counting chaffinches on brownfield sites. Clearly, solitude suited me and here another reading memory seems relevant, dating from some years earlier when, as a zealous member of the Puffin Club, I tore through Tove Jansson\u2019s Moomin books. The first few volumes felt familiar enough \u2013 illustrations, a cast of characters, journeys and adventures \u2013 but as the series went on the tone changed and a literal darkness set in, the books now less about family and community, more about isolation, loneliness, the absence of light. Books had made me sad before but never in this rarefied way, not the pathos of a character\u2019s death, Aslan or Hazel, but something more delicate and indefinable. \u201cThe faint whisper of rain and running water was still there and it had the same tender solitude and perfection but what did the rain mean to him as long as he couldn\u2019t write a song about it?\u201d This is from Moominvalley in November which I must have read when I was 10. It\u2019s unusual, almost inappropriate, to find such distilled melancholy in the pages of an illustrated book and I don\u2019t think that I was a particularly morose child, yet I still remember the sensation of reading it, remember loving it, too. Company is an intrusion and if being alone is sometimes frightening, then the remedy \u2013 the presence of other people \u2013 brings its own concerns. It\u2019s an ambivalence I feel on those long walks, too. I relish the solitude but inevitably there are moments when I think, my God, I really am alone, a twist of panic that will inevitably have me reaching for my phone, specifically for social media, its rough approximation of friendship and connection. Best to resist and just keep walking. Melancholy is a solitary pleasure and something I\u2019ve been drawn to for as long as I remember. Certainly, it\u2019s in my novels which are all, to some degree, romantic comedies about sadness and loss, a feature of the long walks, too, the reason why I don\u2019t mind trudging through drizzle along the verge of a B-road or sitting in empty cafes on grey February afternoons. Extraordinary sunlit vistas are spirit-lifting but I like windblown, out-of-season seafronts, too, infinitely preferable to a Riviera beach in July. I realise I\u2019m not selling this very well, and perhaps this is the reason why I\u2019ve never had to dissuade my family from accompanying me. I confess I don\u2019t always understand the pull of it myself, except that perhaps melancholy bears the same relationship to depression as solitude does to loneliness, in that it\u2019s a deliberate, self-inflicted state that can be shaken off or will at least pass in time. There\u2019s a route out of melancholy and solitude, whereas the great fear with depression and loneliness is it will never end. We all sometimes crave peace and quiet, but who would ever wish for loneliness? * * * Solitude or company, contemplation or conversation. My latest novel, You Are Here, is an attempt to explore the merits of each and its working title, Walking and Talking, is as good a synopsis as any. A comedy in a landscape, it\u2019s a love story about two isolated people, Michael and Marnie, who meet on a weekend hike and decide to keep going, talking, arguing, telling jokes and stories and listening to music along the way. The setting is the Coast to Coast, the famous 192-mile route devised by the great Alfred Wainwright, forming a high belt from St Bees Head in the Western Lakes to Robin Hood\u2019s Bay on the edge of the North York Moors, so that my most recent expeditions have been the longest and must purposeful. Traditionally it takes 12 or so days to cross from west to east, but work and family commitments meant it was undertaken in three parts, also the three acts in the novel, approximating to the Lakes, the Dales and the Moors. If this felt like cheating it was still demanding, beautiful, sometimes boring and desolate. Walking is famously a spur to creativity and I always carry a notebook in the hope that something, the rhythm of boots, a glimpse of the sublime, will unleash some great idea. Until now, I\u2019ve never taken the notebook from my pocket, but I\u2019ve loved writing onto a landscape, matching the sections of the walk to the stages of their relationship, indifference on day one, hostility on day two, curiosity on day three and so on, a novel that comes with maps like the books I loved as a kid, that could even be read on location. Like the best journeys, there are diversions and the final destination is not what\u2019s expected, but it\u2019s a chance to explore these preoccupations with lonesomeness and company, the south and the north, nature and what we hope to take from it. * * * I\u2019m aware of the great claims made for the benefits of walking, to mental health in particular, the notion of a walking cure, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what I was hoping for on that first long journey, turning north on the beach at Alnmouth, and on the later walks, too, a lifting of the spirits at a dark and disorienting time, the difficult years that bracketed my 50th birthday. I\u2019m also sure that they helped, though I\u2019m wary of overstating their power. I\u2019ve felt profoundly unhappy in places of extraordinary beauty and in the novel, as in my own experience, hope and change seem far more likely to spring from conversation and connection, rather than solitude and landscape. It\u2019s too much to expect happiness solely from a view. And yet I know that I will get restless and down if I\u2019m in the city too long, that once or twice a year I\u2019ll feel the need to go for a long walk, and that this is best done alone. This is new. Certainly in my 20s, just one evening spent by myself felt like defeat and even though I don\u2019t \u201clove my own company\u201d, I no longer mind it quite so much. The part of me that wants to be alone is the same part that leaves the party too early and delights in the cancelled plan, the part that sometimes forgets the pleasurable challenge of conversation \u2013 what Bill Callahan, in one song, calls \u201cthe discipline of company\u201d. Still, it feels important to hold on to this time alone, to walk and think and sit in the solitariness, knowing that after a while the novelty will fade, counting myself lucky that it\u2019s a temporary, voluntary state and that I\u2019ll soon want to return as quickly as I possibly can to the complicated joys of other people. \u2022 You Are Here by David Nicholls is published on 23 April by Sceptre at \u00a320.

Viral hits included Craig Covid \u2013 Staying In, a Craig David parody, and his brutal takedown of health secretary Matt Hancock in June 2021 to the tune of Shaggy\u2019s It Wasn\u2019t Me. Chawawa has since appeared on Taskmaster and has twice been nominated for a Bafta for his documentary work: Race Around Britain in 2022 and last year\u2019s How to Survive a Dictator With Munya Chawawa, about Robert Mugabe. He was born in Derby, grew up in Zimbabwe and Norfolk and now lives in south London. You were recently on Celebrity Bake Off and you split an apple in two with your hands. When did you learn that was a skill you had? The thing is, everyone keeps saying to me: \u201cOh, Bob Mortimer did it first.\u201d Listen, there\u2019s only one true test, isn\u2019t there? Me and Bob Mortimer in the ring, unlimited supply of apples, whoever quits first. These days, the ultimate display of toxic masculinity is YouTuber boxing, and it\u2019s time for some YouTuber apple-splitting with Bob Mortimer, one on one. Do you have any other party tricks? I can distinguish between hot and cold water just by sound. So any tap, any flowing water, within maybe a couple of seconds, I\u2019ll be able to tell the temperature of that water. And yeah, look, maybe it\u2019s not a party trick, but it\u2019s a survival trick, I think. Because how many times have you come across a body of water and thought: \u201cI\u2019d love to plunge in. But I just don\u2019t know if it\u2019s boiling hot.\u201d Can you share the secret of how you do that? No, I think this is the kind of thing that Marvel needs to be jumping on early doors and saying: \u201cRight, we\u2019ve done Spider-Man. We\u2019ve done the Avengers. Now it\u2019s time for Hot Cold Water Man.\u201d Was there a moment, or video you made, where you realised that your life was going to change? Yeah, so we were pretty much told at the beginning of lockdown: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be staying in.\u201d And in my mind, I was like: \u201cWell, staying in feels a bit like Fill Me In by Craig David.\u201d And as I was drawing on this moustache, in what I didn\u2019t know at the time was permanent marker, I remember thinking: \u201cThis could be something.\u201d It feels like an age ago now; there have been so many things since then that were beyond my wildest dreams: my double Bafta nominations, I\u2019ve done a Netflix series [The Sandman], Taskmaster. My life entirely changed, so yes, I want to thank marker pens, basically. You are known for responding very quickly: your Matt Hancock video was released four hours after the story broke. Was that an intense pressure to be under? Let\u2019s just say this, I had to cancel a lot of Nandos. I became the world\u2019s worst friend for a period because we\u2019d book in things and then a politician would get caught doing something on CCTV and I\u2019d be like: \u201cGuys, we\u2019re going to have to postpone.\u201d But to be honest with you, I was so excited during that time, and I still am. What I love about the internet and making satire online is that one video can change your life, because you never know who\u2019s going to see it. You did a standup tour last year. Why did you want to switch to that form of comedy? I wanted to do standup because I was terrified of it. So it was a challenge I set myself. I said: \u201cRight, I\u2019ve got a year, I\u2019m going to do 80 gigs before my tour starts.\u201d And I\u2019m not talking about little red-carpet rollout events: I\u2019m talking pubs in Bexleyheath, comedy clubs in Newcastle and Edinburgh. It was basically just leaping and seeing if the net would appear. And how did it go? Stormzy came to watch one of my shows in London. And I just heard at one moment, he was up in this seat doing gun fingers, which is a south London sign of approval. That was good enough for me. Ed Gamble has said you were one of his favourite guests on the Off Menu podcast, because your life has just been so bizarre. Does it feel like that to you? Look, I want to be the effortlessly cool guy. But weird stuff constantly happens to me. And maybe it\u2019s hereditary. I called up my dad the other day and he sounded a bit down. And he went: \u201cOh, I\u2019ve just been really dehydrated this week.\u201d And then he went on: \u201cSo my eyes have been feeling funny. And so I\u2019m in the gym.\u201d I was just like: \u201cThat is such an incohesive thought pattern.\u201d The problem, the symptoms and the solution. First of all, how are you dehydrated for an entire week? And what exercise in the gym is proven to solve dehydration? I couldn\u2019t tell you. What\u2019s next for you? Well, excitingly, there\u2019s a lot of stuff I can\u2019t talk about. But my aspirations are to get back into making amazing TV. I want to be the Swiss army knife of TV shows, because I\u2019m up for all of it. And I want to make important TV: my philosophy is I want to do stuff that\u2019s hilarious, but also means something. Basically, everything Joe Lycett is doing at the moment, I\u2019m taking loads of inspiration from that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be as passionate about sewage and toilets as he is. But I\u2019ll find my passion points somewhere else. You have a vision board at home where you post images of your career goals. What\u2019s on there now? I\u2019ve made two Bafta-nominated shows and I\u2019m thinking: \u201cRight, cool, I\u2019m coming for that Bafta.\u201d Probably scuba diving as well. Scuba diving is one thing I\u2019m terrified of because I\u2019ve got an irrational fear of sea urchins. I don\u2019t even know why. So yeah, conquering a fear of sea urchins and the Bafta!

Listless men in police uniform sweat, drool and rule. Spain, in the Royal Opera House\u2019s Carmen, newly staged by Damiano Michieletto and conducted by Antonello Manacorda, is a semi-urban wasteland at the end of the General Franco era. A country long steeped in God, corrida and family has stumbled across modernity. Girls bare their midriffs and want freedom: a cry more urgent and credible in this mid-1970s updating than when Georges Bizet\u2019s masterpiece was new a century earlier, in 1875 (and flopped). With the world-class Russian mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina in the title role, the ROH has snapped up a dream Carmen. (A second cast will be led by another Russian, Vasilisa Berzhanskaya, from 12 May.) Still only 27, a former ROH Jette Parker artist, Akhmetshina inhabits the part in all its nuances. She shows vulnerability, is vocally athletic and physically compelling. Her virile but hapless Don Jos\u00e9 is Piotr Beczala; they have just sung the same roles together in Carrie Cracknell\u2019s new Carmen at the New York Met. The Polish tenor\u2019s gilded top notes match Akhmetshina\u2019s own in energy and brilliance: he is deft at suggesting, in gesture and bearing, a man tight-knotted by duty and desire. Now the Carmen of choice all over the world, Akhmetshina is too astute, too much of a fireball, to fall back on habit. No doubt she will create an entirely different character when she performs the role at Glyndebourne this summer (conducted by Robin Ticciati, directed by Diane Paulus), just as she did when she jumped in, aged 22, to Barrie Kosky\u2019s ROH staging in late 2018. Kosky\u2019s radical adventure was a tour de force, set on a precipitous flight of stairs. Not everyone loved it. I did. Its ROH life, much like that of its title character, was short, maddening and provocative. It could never have lasted. Designed by Paolo Fantin, with costumes by Carla Teti and lighting by Alessandro Carletti, Michieletto\u2019s production looks durable. In a near-empty stage, a cabin pinpoints the action, functioning as police station, nightclub, pre-bullfight dressing room. A grid of 100 small lights blazes down, compounding the mood of perpetual monotony and enclosure. The use of a revolve echoes the same creative team\u2019s successful ROH double bill Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci. There are clever touches. Putting on stage the woman who is powerful by virtue of her absence \u2013 Don Jos\u00e9\u2019s mother \u2013 in black mantilla, clutching a card of death, was not one. Nor was it smart to portray poor, plucky Mica\u00ebla as a cardigan-and-specs-wearing saddo. Or perhaps this visual cliche has now gone full circle and become a novelty. The exceptional and lyrical Ukrainian soprano Olga Kulchynska, in her ROH debut, triumphed regardless. Musical standards give this Carmen its edge and excitement, and make it worth catching at its forthcoming cinema relays. Manacorda probed the score\u2019s fire and detail, with the ROH orchestra, especially solo strings and woodwind, alert, subtle, expansive. Inevitably, the spoken dialogue \u2013 always a problem, and here in none-too-convincing French \u2013 gave a stop-start feeling to the performance. That was not Manacorda\u2019s fault. His sense of tempo and momentum were impressive. Kostas Smoriginas as Escamillo, unappetising in a lime green raw silk suit, Sarah Dufresne as Frasquita and Gabriel\u0117 Kup\u0161yt\u0117 as Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s led the large and admirable supporting ensemble. The ROH chorus was joined by the ROH Youth Opera Company, a chorus of nine- to 13-year-olds who sang enthusiastically and captured our hearts. Some of these young musicians may one day aspire to join the National Youth Choir, or its smaller offshoot, the National Youth Chamber Choir: nearly two dozen talented 18- to 25-year-olds, many embarking on professional careers. As part of the London Handel festival, with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the NYCC performed Handel\u2019s Four Coronation Anthems, interspersed with related works by living composers: H\u00e9lo\u00efse Werner, Anna Clyne, Ben Nobuto and Roderick Williams. With singing and playing of deft assurance, the evening bowled along under the baton of Sofi Jeannin, starting with Handel\u2019s Zadok the Priest. The contrasts between the new works proved stimulating. (All but Clyne\u2019s In Thy Beauty, from 2021, were world premieres.) Werner\u2019s Rejoice! created five minutes of musical exuberance and verbal refraction, sounds and syllables uniting into recognisable words: all, people, rejoice. Nobuto\u2019s Face Anthem! had a dance-like sampled energy, punchy and effective. Williams\u2019s Exceeding Glad!, the seeds of which grew out of this singer-composer\u2019s own involvement with the coronation of King Charles last year, beguiled with its joyfulness, including hand claps, finger clicks and a vivid impression of pealing bells. Starting with a tribute to the Hungarian composer P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, who died last month, the London Symphony Orchestra opened its latest LSO Futures/Panufnik Composers Scheme concert with E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\u2019s own Per Luciano Berio: brief, beautiful, atmospheric, new to the UK. Without space here to say more, I can only urge you to check out the latest featured composers, each conducted with clarity and empathy by Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Roth. They are: Christian Drew, Donghoon Shin and Stef Conner. From watery, reverb-heavy doo-wop (I\u2019m quoting), to a virtuosic solo cellist (the LSO\u2019s Rebecca Gilliver) journeying through an exquisite aural nightscape, to a death metal-inspired wild bullet of sound, brutal but harmonically radiant, this was a feast for enquiring ears. The concert ended with a dazzle in the form of Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Concerto for Orchestra. How the second violins launched into the fugal finale at such a lightning pace without, I swear, moving their bows will remain an enigma.

Then along comes Courtney Love. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you recited Sylvia Plath\u2019s Daddy at your audition for The Mickey Mouse Club?\u201d asks her co-host, journalist Rob Harvilla, on Courtney Love\u2019s Women, a new eight-parter that broadcast its first episodes last week at 11pm (Monday-Thursday) on BBC Radio 6 Music. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sing, I couldn\u2019t dance but I could re-cite,\u201d Love says of herself at 11, matter-of-factly. \u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to care about the Nazi references!\u201d Thirty years after the death of her husband, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, and the release by her band, Hole, of their 1994 breakthrough album Live Through This (a raucously accessible entry point into feminism and punk for teenage girls, of whom I was one), Love is now quite the alternative grande dame of the airwaves. This series spans her life, beginning with her anarchic 60s childhood in San Francisco\u2019s Haight-Ashbury, surrounded by her mother\u2019s counterculture magazines, poetry records (hence the Plath, which is glorious to hear, in full, on a pop show) and odd attitudes to pop culture (Love saw Last Tango in Paris in the cinema and Hair at the theatre but wasn\u2019t allowed to watch the Cher show on TV). Early in episode one, anecdotes trail off and errors around dates go uncorrected, making me fear a tsunami of self-indulgence and tall tales. But a rough-and-ready, very charming memoir emerges, told through the voices and sounds of other women \u2013 singers, instrumentalists and writers \u2013 who Love sought while growing up in what she calls a male \u201cgatekeeping mono-overculture\u201d. Her choices aren\u2019t about projecting edginess, but being honest and passionate about what she holds dear. I loved her urging listeners to find Karen Carpenter\u2019s vocals-only take of Close to You (\u201cit is as close to God as you can get\u201d) and recalling Joan Baez records giving her comfort during her grunge days with Kurt. \u201cShe made me feel safe and secure, like my stepdad taking me to the postcard store.\u201d Beautiful. Love is curious and clever throughout, with a nice line in self-deprecation (she slags off a Buffy Sainte-Marie cover she did in 2010: \u201cThis was in my flop era!\u201d). The music is a fabulous mix, too, from Big Mama Thornton to Donna Summer, Marlene Dietrich to Dolly Parton, and although the role of Harvilla often feels extraneous, you sense that Love needs a foil for her lightning bolt to brightly bounce off. Four more episodes of chaotic fun follow next week. You wait a few days for a BBC podcast led by a famously forthright singer and two turn up at once: cue Charlotte Church\u2019s Kicking Back With the Cardiffians. Church\u2019s family \u2013 working-class, sweary, unfiltered \u2013 are introduced episode by episode, and the first show is called There Now in a Minute, named after a bit of Welsh slang which means you\u2019re on your way. (Clearly there to suggest fun and warmth, these titles, to this Swansea-born writer, risk making the Welsh look like people to laugh at rather than laugh with.) It\u2019s a slow, strange listen at first, with no explanation of who Church was in the past or is now. In recent years she has become a wellness guru, buying Laura Ashley\u2019s former home in mid-Wales, in which she offers affordable luxury retreats. This part of her only intrudes on the first episode when she tries to get her \u201cdada\u201d to breathe deeply to \u201clet us land and be calm in where we\u2019re sat\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not into this sort of shit!\u201d he hilariously bites back. They then chat tenderly about his penchant for \u201cflipping houses\u201d to make money, the horrific abuse he endured as a child, and his terminal diagnosis with AL amyloidosis (\u201cI caught Charlotte trying to turn the switch off,\u201d he says, to her laughter, on once being put on a life support machine). You wonder who will listen to this who isn\u2019t a fan of Church, although it\u2019s so refreshing to hear these working-class stories explored in depth. Given the tabloid scrutiny Church survived in her youth, you also understand why she wants to show the other sides of her story, in her own words. Two more recommendations this week: the London Review of Books is a few brilliant episodes into The Belgrano Diary, in which the novelist Andrew O\u2019Hagan tells the story of the Falklands war through excellent BBC and ITV archive recordings, officer diaries and LRB pieces from the time by the Labour MP Tam Dalyell. O\u2019Hagan\u2019s got a great podcast voice, all Glasgow fog and bite, bringing levity to the military material.

Since Covid crippled the live music sector in 2020-21, Secret Sounds and its parent company, Live Nation Australia Festivals \u2013 the owners of some of Australia\u2019s largest music festivals including Splendour, Spilt Milk, the Falls festival and Harvest Rock \u2013 have received more than $16m in government grants, including $1.09m for a 2021 festival that was subsequently cancelled and $2.6m for a partially washed out 2022 festival. As recently as February, the NSW government was scrambling to broker another package to ensure Splendour went ahead in 2024. At the end of 2022, Secret Sounds was carrying short-term liabilities of $82.7m, and $29.7m in long-term debt, according to the latest documents lodged with the corporate regulator. The documents show that its debts outweighed its assets by $9.3m at that point, up from $8.7m the previous year. Its ultimate parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, is one of the world\u2019s largest entertainment companies. Since its merger with the ticketing colossus Ticketmaster in 2010, the corporation has been hoovering up ticketing services, concert promotion deals, festivals and more than 300 venues globally. Live Nation Australia owns or holds long-term leases for a growing number of venues, including Melbourne\u2019s Palais Theatre and Festival Hall and Brisbane\u2019s Fortitude Music Hall. And, like its US parent company, the Australian subsidiary holds exclusive ticketing rights through Ticketmaster. In 2019 it consolidated its ticketing dominance by acquiring Moshtix for an undisclosed sum. The following year Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2013 controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 bought a A$770m stake in Live Nation Entertainment, making it the third-largest shareholder. Last year Live Nation Entertainment generated US$22.75bn (A$34.34bn) in revenue, a 36% increase from 2022, and recorded a net profit of US$563m. Multiple pandemic grants Jessica Ducrou and Paul Piticco famously brainstormed what was to become Splendour in the Grass in a Byron Bay pub in the 1990s, when he was the manager of a little-known group from Brisbane called Powderfinger and she was a rookie booking agent fresh out of the accounts department at Rolling Stone. In 2016 the pair merged their various businesses and projects into the Secret Sounds Group. A few months later, Secret Sounds sold a 51% share of the company to Live Nation for an undisclosed sum. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Ducrou and Piticco are now co-chief executives and directors of Secret Sounds. An analysis of documents lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) shows that Secret Sounds reported net assets of $13.2m in 2017 and $8.9m in 2018, but the company was losing money before the pandemic hit. It went from reporting a $2.9m profit in 2017 to a $4.2m operating loss in 2018, according to documents lodged with the corporate regulator. Guardian Australia was unable to find an annual report for 2019 lodged with Asic, but understands that the operating loss grew substantially that calendar year. The following year Secret Sounds\u2019 finances also took a hit through the $7m settlement of a class action in the Victorian supreme court over the 2016 Falls festival in Lorne, where dozens of people were injured in a crowd crush. Five months into lockdown in 2020, the Morrison government announced the $75m restart investment to sustain and expand (Rise) fund for the cultural sector. That fund, which was to support cultural organisations hit by lockdowns, was to grow to $200m over the following 18 months. Secret Sounds and Live Nation\u2019s Australia subsidiary would become two of the fund\u2019s most successful applicants, securing six Rise grants totalling $5.8m. In the first round of emergency funding in late 2020, Secret Sounds secured $1.59m for an unspecified festival, while Live Nation received $120,000 for a podcast festival. The following year, Splendour received $1m for its 2021 festival, which was ultimately cancelled due to Covid disruption, and the Secret Sounds-owned company Ash Sounds received $1.48m for the 2021-22 Falls festival. Live Nation secured $1.6m in a further three Rise grants. In 2023, Live Nation received several additional grants through the government\u2019s Live Music Australia body totalling more than $200,000, including $100,00 for the 2024 Splendour, now cancelled. The companies also collected more than $10m from the NSW government over the same period. Live Nation received $2.5m in Create NSW\u2019s performing arts Covid support payments for \u201cvarious performances\u201d, according to a government spokesperson, and an additional $5m through the Create NSW festival relaunch program. Secret Sounds received $353,730 from Create NSW\u2019s performing arts Covid support program and most recently $2.6m to assist the relaunch of Splendour in 2022. The South Australian government has also supported events run by Secret Sounds, providing an unspecified amount for its annual Harvest Rock festival for three years. An SA Tourism Commission spokesperson said Harvest injected $18m into the state\u2019s economy last year, but details of the sponsorship were subject to contractual confidentiality. Secret Sounds recorded a total of $3.43m in income from government grants for 2022. The same year the company once more recorded an operating loss. According to its latest accounts, in 2022 it reported a $1.1m operating loss. Secret Sounds owns or has interests in a number of companies that run various festivals and businesses, including Splendour in the Grass Pty Ltd. While the underlying financial position of each subsidiary is not set out in the accounts, the Guardian understands Splendour had net assets in 2022. In July last year, Live Nation exercised an option in its contract to compulsorily acquire a further 25% of shares from Secret Sounds\u2019 14 other shareholders, including Ducrou and Piticco. The Guardian understands that due to Secret Sounds\u2019 financial state, Live Nation acquired the shares without any payment to the shareholders. \u2018Heartbroken\u2019 at cancellation When the announcement came last month that Splendour would not go ahead this year, Ducrou and Piticco said they were \u201cheartbroken\u201d, and the decision to cancel was \u201cdue to unexpected events\u201d. The NSW arts minister, John Graham, told Guardian Australia he was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Splendour\u2019s cancellation. Late last year he began negotiating with Destination NSW for another rescue package for Splendour 2024. The minister would not provide details about the negotiations, which involved a \u201csignificant\u201d sum of money, citing commercial in confidence. A Live Nation spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cThe NSW government offered some support for Splendour in the Grass in 2024, but no funds were received because the event is not moving forward. \u201cAll events in prior years that received some level of government funding proceeded in accordance with the approved terms.\u201d Graham said all organisations that received government funding underwent financial scrutiny. \u201cAny government assistance comes with very, very stringent auditing requirements and a close examination of financial records \u2026 that would have been the case in this instance,\u201d Graham said. He declined to comment on why a government would provide millions of dollars to an entity majority-owned by a highly profitable S&amp;P 500 corporation partially owned by the Saudi regime. The funding of Splendour was in Australia\u2019s public interest, Graham said. \u201cSplendour is a crucial part of the festival circuit \u2026 this is one of the reasons it\u2019s devastating it hasn\u2019t gone ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will now be a blow to every other festival that\u2019s going to run over next summer. It decreases confidence in the financial backers, in the ticket buyers, in the music acts who might invest in the next festival season.\u201d Secret Sounds said the company would uphold all contractual commitments in relation to Splendour 2024\u2019s cancellation and was working to find alternative performances for the artists involved.", "date": "2024-04-13", "section": "Culture", "author": "Kelly Burke", "id": 141, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ce1f3bbbcb3dcc3f730bff547ce38f22dba01571/0_821_4187_2514/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Roberto Cavalli, flamboyant Italian fashion designer, dies aged 83", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/apr/12/roberto-cavalli-flamboyant-italian-fashion-designer-dies-aged-83", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.063, "neu": 0.705, "pos": 0.232, "compound": 0.9983}, "body": "Roberto Cavalli, the Italian fashion designer known for his glamorous designs, colourful prints and scores of celebrity fans, has died in Florence at the age of 83. His rich aesthetic, which featured flamboyant prints inspired by the worlds of exotic flora and fauna, high hemlines and even lower waistlines, was unapologetically sexy. His lifestyle was equally lavish, with his main residence a 13-hectare (32-acre) Tuscan estate featuring a vineyard, tanning machine, racehorses, Ferraris and a menagerie of animals including parrots, iguanas, a Persian cat, a monkey and tiger. His estate also included a personal helicopter and a superyacht called Freedom. Its design was inspired by the movie Batman. Cavalli launched his eponymous label in 1970 and made a name for himself when he patented a new way of printing on leather. He showcased his revolutionary technique for the first time in his debut collection in Paris, which featured a pink leather evening gown. Cavalli immediately earned commissions from French houses including Herm\u00e8s and Pierre Cardin. He later turned his skills to denim. His autumn/winter \u201994 collection showed the first ever pair of sand-blasted jeans and the following year he worked with Lycra to invent stretch jeans. The form-fitting jeans were an instant success, leading him to launch a dedicated line, Cavalli Jeans, later renamed Just Cavalli. He was adored by celebrities. In his early years, Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren frequented his store, Limbo, in Saint-Tropez. However, it was during the hedonistic 90s that his flashy and flamboyant aesthetic really exploded. Thanks to David and Victoria Beckham, Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez, a new aspiring and affluent demographic discovered the brand. Cavalli began to expand his fashion empire comprising branded underwear, eyewear, footwear, watches and perfume. Homeware, pet attire, vodka, wines, restaurants and members\u2019 clubs followed. Despite its popularity, in 2014 the business began to post annual losses. A year later the family sold a 90% stake to the Italian private equity firm Clessidra, reportedly valuing the business at \u20ac390m. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2019 and later that year it was bought by the Dubai-based Vision Investment Company. In October 2020, the Sicilian designer Fausto Puglisi was appointed creative director. In a statement from the brand announcing Cavalli\u2019s death, Puglisi wrote: \u201cDear Roberto, you may not be physically here with us any more, but I know I will feel your spirit with me always. \u201cIt is the greatest honour of my career to work under your legacy and to create for the brand you founded with such vision and style. Rest in peace you will be missed, and you are loved by so many that your name will continue on, a beacon of inspiration for others, and especially for me.\u201d Giorgio Armani paid tribute to his fellow Italian fashion designer and described him as a \u201ctrue artist\u201d. In a post shared by the Armani account on X, he said: \u201cI cannot imagine a vision of fashion more distant from mine than that of Roberto Cavalli, yet I have always had enormous respect for him: Roberto was a true artist, wild and wonderful in his use of prints, capable of transforming fantasy into seductive clothes. \u201cI have learnt with great sadness of his passing: his Tuscan verve will be greatly missed.\u201d Victoria Beckham shared a tribute on her Instagram stories, posting a photo of herself holding hands with Cavalli while he had his hand raised and made the peace sign. \u201cSo sorry to hear the sad news of Roberto\u2019s passing. He\u2019ll forever be an icon.\u201d The Brazilian model Adriana Lima posted a photograph of herself and Cavalli on X and wrote: \u201cUnapologetic in style &amp; spirit. We lost a legend today. Rest in Peace.\u201d American singer and actor Jennifer Hudson wrote on the platform: \u201cRoberto Cavalli was always one of my favorite designers. A true artist in every sense of the word! \u201cHe made the world a more beautiful place and will be dearly missed. May he rest in peace!\u201d. Cavalli was born in 1940 in a small village in Tuscany. His grandfather, Giuseppe Rossi, was a celebrated artist and member of the Macchiaioli movement. Cavalli later moved with his mother, a seamstress, and siblings to Florence after the murder of his father by German soldiers. It was while studying at the Academy of Art in Florence in 1957 that he began experimenting with textiles. He married his first wife, Silvanella Giannoni, in 1964 and had two children. They divorced in 1974 and in 1980 he married Eva Duringer, a former Miss Universe contestant he met while judging the pageant in 1977. The couple had three children and Eva became his business partner. The couple worked together until they sold the business. They divorced in 2010. In 2023 he announced the birth of his sixth child, a son, with his partner, the Swedish model and actor Sandra Nilsson.", "date": "2024-04-13", "section": "Fashion", "author": "Chloe Mac Donnell", "id": 142, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9b6cd1f861e93863d7ee49e934cc7fa116d66745/0_178_3702_2222/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Robin Browne obituary", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/apr/14/robin-browne-obituary", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.043, "neu": 0.726, "pos": 0.23, "compound": 0.9956}, "body": "My friend Robin Browne, who has died aged 82, was a cinematographer specialising in aerial photography and special effects. His was not a name in lights, but he consistently excelled without the razzmatazz of Hollywood. I doubt there is anyone who has seen one of his films and not marvelled at the skills and dangers involved. He started out as a clapper boy in the late 1950s, and worked on dozens of distinguished films over the next five decades, as camera assistant, operator and as director of photography leading specialist units. A few titles give a flavour: Battle of Britain (1969); Catch 22 (1970); the television series The Adventures of Black Beauty (1972-74), on which he was camera operator for all 52 episodes; three Bond movies in the 1970s; A Bridge Too Far (1977); Krull (1983); A Passage to India (1984); The Jewel of the Nile (1985); King Kong Lives (1986); Gorillas in the Mist (1988); and Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story (2009). For me, the one that takes the breath away, and is truly described as an epic, is the award-winning biopic Gandhi (1982), produced and directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Ben Kingsley, on which Robin was in charge of aerial photography. Robin\u2019s bywords \u2013 \u201cgo easy on the lighting and not too much camera movement\u201d \u2013 imbued the crowd scenes often shot from above with special impact. He and I were friends from boyhood. Robin was born, just a month after me, in Aylesbury, and later moved to north London, where we went to Highgate school and grew up together. In those days there were more open fields than houses and we joined with another friend to form the three musketeers. All our holidays were preoccupied with adventures plotting the course of the Dollis brook through its many manifestations until it reached the Thames and setting challenges for each other to conquer known and imagined fears. Robin\u2019s mother, Diana (nee Mannering), was a well-known fashion model under the name Diana Jones. His father was Bernard Browne, a director of photography who worked with Alexander Korda at Denham studios; Robin was clearly talented and destined for the film world. He joined it as soon as he could, at 16, with an apprenticeship at Merton Park Studios in south London before moving to work at Shepperton. Unusually he had a tiny dark room at his home and I was able to witness the mysteries of photography, development, and editing at close quarters. At school he ran the photography club. He ended up settling in the US, moving in 1991 to Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, with his wife Judy (nee Doetze), whom he had married in 1978. This meant that he and I would meet less often, but we never lost touch. He was respected and well known for his unassuming manner, his caring generosity of spirit, his thoughtful and considerate intellectual approach at work and at home. Latterly he turned his hand to research into historic documents in preparation for a book about to be completed relating to Shakespeare authorship and Francis Bacon. Undoubtedly Robin would have had plans to turn it into a novel film. He is survived by Judy, and their children, Justin and Debbie.", "date": "2024-04-14", "section": "Film", "author": "Michael Mansfield", "id": 143, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3828b1cea886719ddb1f5172afc1960b2b0990c0/1232_367_1449_869/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Childcare in England failing and falling behind much of world, charity says", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/apr/15/childcare-in-england-failing-and-falling-behind-much-of-world-charity-says", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.085, "neu": 0.712, "pos": 0.203, "compound": 0.9952}, "body": "England\u2019s childcare system is failing and falling behind those of much of the rest of the world, a UK charity for gender equality and women\u2019s rights has said. The Fawcett Society said childcare in England was failing on several fronts: affordability, quality and levels of public spending. The charity looked at early childhood education and care (ECEC) provision in Australia, Canada, Estonia, France, and Ireland \u2013 all countries that have recently completed or are undergoing government-led transformation in the sector \u2013 and found England\u2019s childcare fell short in ambition and delivery. The findings echo numerous warnings on the state of childcare in England, with surveys finding that a third of parents with young children say they are struggling to afford childcare, nurseries warning that government plans for free childcare are undeliverable, and about a quarter of a million mothers with young children leaving their jobs because of difficulties with balancing work and childcare. The most recent change to England\u2019s childcare system, which came into force this month, was an expansion of free hours. The Fawcett Society said that while this was welcome for some families, the narrow focus of the expansion would not help those who are disadvantaged and would not address the wider issues with the system. The charity argues in its report that the government should offer free \u201cuniversal\u201d hours of ECEC provision for all children from the end of parental leave until school age. Jemima Olchawski, the Fawcett Society\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur childcare is some of the most expensive in the world and it isn\u2019t working. Research shows that 85% of mothers struggle to find childcare that fits around their work and one in 10 have quit jobs due to childcare pressures. \u201cFor too long we\u2019ve seen the cracks in our dysfunctional childcare system papered over. We\u2019ve got a patchwork of provision that doesn\u2019t meet the needs of children, parents or the childcare sector. But a broken system isn\u2019t inevitable, as the countries in our research clearly show. We need politicians from all parties to work together and make genuine commitments that last beyond this election \u2013 and indeed the next \u2013 to reform childcare. \u201cThere are plenty of countries around the world who simply do childcare better and we should be learning from their ambition. As we approach a general election, all parties need to be aware that any credible vision for transforming childcare mustn\u2019t simply offer bolt-ons to a crumbling system. We must be more ambitious, particularly when it has such an impact on both children\u2019s life chances and women\u2019s ability to work.\u201d The report outlines a plan for long-term reform in England that includes building on and expanding the existing \u201cfree hours\u201d to make the offer open to all children, not just those of working parents, with extra subsidies for the poorest to enable them to afford to supplement the universal offer, and fee freezes for everyone. The report also recommends providing funding to nurseries so they can operate in unprofitable areas, and support inclusion for all children. Alesha De-Freitas, the director of policy, research and advocacy at the Fawcett Society, said: \u201cAffordability is clearly essential but we\u2019ve got stuck on it. When you look at other countries, you find a richness to the conversations about what is genuinely best for children that is so different to the UK.\u201d The Fawcett Society report warns that \u201cdesigning a system which is focused narrowly on [affordability] without strengthening and resourcing the system \u2026 may ultimately be counterproductive and unable to meet the demands it has set up\u201d. There is ample international evidence that higher-quality childcare has huge long-term economic and social benefits, it says. \u201cThe early years of a child\u2019s life are so important \u2013 the evidence for that is growing all the time,\u201d De-Freitas added. \u201cIt really impacts on children\u2019s long-term outcomes and access to education. We should be aiming for so much better than just having somewhere for parents to park their children while they\u2019re at work.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cThis government is delivering the largest ever expansion of childcare in England\u2019s history, set to save parents taking up the full 30 hours an average of \u00a36,900 for the new entitlements. \u201cWorking parents on universal credit are also eligible for support with childcare costs no matter how many hours they work, up to \u00a31,015 per month for a single child and \u00a31,739 for two children. England has some of the highest-quality early years provision in the world, with 96% of early years settings rated by Ofsted as good or outstanding as of August 2023 \u2013 up from 74% in 2012.\u201d", "date": "2024-04-14", "section": "Education", "author": "Jamie Grierson and Archie Bland", "id": 144, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/75f5824b94872f749551c70643d637cbd853edfa/0_112_3645_2187/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Letters: Eleanor Stanier obituary", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/apr/14/letters-eleanor-stanier-obituary", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.043, "neu": 0.58, "pos": 0.377, "compound": 0.9844}, "body": "Eleanor Stanier, active as a community organiser and councillor in Richmond upon Thames, taught me history between 1966 and 1968.

But looking out, sober, at a culture that is now coming to associate alcohol exclusively with pain, I feel as if we are at risk of forgetting what a truly lovely thing a bit of booze can be. Is that OK? Is it OK to say this? To celebrate the lost art of \u201chaving a little drink\u201d?

It goes without saying, I hope, that sobriety is life-saving for many, that addiction is an exhausting, rusted weight to carry around, that alcoholism is a mental illness and a medical issue that requires empathy and treatment, but I am talking now to those who are lucky enough to be able to enjoy alcohol without it derailing the rest of their lives: I propose we keep a fond place in our heart for the little drink. Even, for getting a bit drunk. Even, for getting really quite drunk, actually, and all the chaos and pleasure and terrible decisions and unexplained bruises and mad truths it brings. You don\u2019t have to get really drunk and screw something up spectacularly in order to discover who you are and who you want to be, but\u2026 it helps. You don\u2019t have to get really drunk and spend an entire night standing in the kitchen of a party talking to a stranger about the pool scene in Showgirls and whether you felt understood as a child to become an adult, you don\u2019t have to get really drunk with someone\u2019s sister and laugh so much you are sick in a wallet to find a best friend, but, ditto. You don\u2019t have to keep clear in your mind the promise of a beaker of old wine sunk very fast at 9pm to be a good mother. You don\u2019t have to survive a hangover that you fear may have permanently affected your posture and left you feeling like composted regret to start drinking three pints of water a day. You don\u2019t have to. But, you know. All I\u2019m saying, is, in the hurry to promote a healthier lifestyle, let\u2019s please not discount altogether the sometime joys of \u201chaving a drink\u201d. Is that OK? I say this as an accidental sober person, skin glowing, head clear, the whites of my eyes frankly dazzling, waking each morning with the pep and optimism of an actual idiot. Let us not fear the occasional dawdle into drunkenness, the long lunch, the stained lips or ill-placed hand. Let us deal with the slapstick and fallouts, slowly and with care, as if adults. Let us enjoy the rare thrill of a cold drink at the perfect time, the cracking-open, the mischief. Let\u2019s just have a little drink.

That\u2019s where Business Improvement Districts (Bids) step in \u2013 schemes funded by a levy on local companies on top of their business rates, with the money going to a private, not-for-profit company designed to help boost the attractiveness of the area. But a backlash is growing against Bids, with dozens of cases across the UK of people refusing to make the mandatory payments and ending up in court as a result. Angry business owners argue that Bids are being created in towns and cities without proper consent, and that there is a lack of clarity about how funds are spent and how much value they add to the local area. Some communities have even suggested that councils are pushing through the creation of Bids, because in some cases local authorities can cast several votes in a Bid ballot, as they own assets such as car parks and public toilets in the area. A Bid is created when it is voted for via a ballot that occurs every five years, which is open to all eligible businesses in the area. But opponents say because there is no minimum threshold for turnout and a lack of information for voters, they can be formed with very little support. Shawn Rutter is an adviser with the campaign Against Bid, which offers advice to businesses that want to challenge the creation of a Bid in their area. He says the number of people seeking the group\u2019s help is growing and now stands at more than 2,000. \u201cWe just want to level the playing field to make it a more informed and open vote. If you\u2019re going to have a five-year tax, and it\u2019s a very one-sided Yes campaign, it\u2019s not really very democratic,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a lot of small businesses it isn\u2019t a lot of money, but it is the principle with a lot of people. If they see it as a cost with no benefits, they think \u2018why am I paying it?\u2019.\u201d There are 335 Bids in the UK and Ireland, involving 132,962 businesses, with a further 61 Bids in development, more than two decades after the idea was first introduced in 2004. The organisation British Bids, which represents Bids across the UK, says the growth shows \u201ca continued enthusiasm and increasing perceived benefit\u201d. Its director of research, Chris Turner, says: \u201cAs the public sector has withdrawn from our public spaces, businesses have had to step up to the plate to provide a whole range of services. In some places, that\u2019s everything from Christmas lights to hanging baskets, to street cleaning, to security. In other places, it\u2019s about inward investment and marketing. The feedback we get from most businesses is it\u2019s actually nice to be involved with something where people are coming together to try to make places better.\u201d Turner anticipates the importance of Bids will grow as councils struggling to balance the books slash non-statutory services, following a decade of government cuts and with demand for services increasing. Councils including Birmingham and Nottingham have recently issued section 114 notices, in effect declaring bankruptcy, and nearly one in five council leaders predict their authority could go the same way this year. \u201cAcross the sector, there\u2019s a growing realisation that if businesses want their towns to work, if they want them to be clean, safe and attractive, they have to contribute,\u201d says Turner. \u201cBusinesses are getting involved in this stuff in a much more intense agenda because life\u2019s pretty grim out there, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d However, there is also a growing opposition to the movement in some parts of the country, and a number of businesses are trying to overturn them or refusing to pay the levy. In Stratford-on-Avon, a group of businesses are appealing to the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, to reverse the renewal of the Bid there following a vote in February, arguing the ballot was not held correctly. Meanwhile, a large number of businesses along the Yorkshire coast are gearing up to fight the renewal of England\u2019s largest Bid, which encompasses 1,300 firms in the area. It was first introduced in 2018 following a vote with a turnout of 29%. Of the 217 votes cast in favour, almost 70 were from Scarborough and East Riding councils, which collect the tax on behalf of the Bid, as their car parks and public toilets are classed as businesses. Hundreds of business owners refused to pay the levy, with many ending up in court, and by the end of 2021, 800 companies were in arrears. Local councils have agreed to abstain from voting in the Bid renewal ballot this year, which will also exempt retail businesses. Harry Scott, owner of the Delmont Hotel in Scarborough, is due in court in June over a \u00a35,000 Bid levy he is refusing to pay. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in trouble in my life and now I\u2019ve had to appear in court. My offence is refusing to give away my money to somebody I don\u2019t know, so that they can do with it as they please,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole thing is about as transparent as a brick wall. In a so-called democratic society it\u2019s disgraceful. I really don\u2019t think it has done anything for us.\u201d A spokesperson for the Yorkshire Coast Bid said: \u201cWe have and continue to work closely with our members and are proud to say that it is with their ideas, funding and support that we have been able to fund over 156 events, raise over \u00a3100,000 for local charities, and match over \u00a31.4m of our business funding, all to promote the Yorkshire coast as a destination for locals and visitors. \u201cWith the knowledge of what has been delivered over the last five years, we hope that, similar to the hundreds of Bids around the UK, our members will choose to vote to keep our organisation in place to support them further.\u201d In Twickenham, south-west London, Matthew Hugill runs a tattoo shop within the Discover Twickenham Bid area, and recently avoided a liability order over an unpaid levy when the judge decided the local council could not provide evidence it had billed him correctly. \u201cI just paid it at first because I didn\u2019t really understand what it was. But then I started questioning it and looking into it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe majority of businesses didn\u2019t vote [to create it], which means they\u2019re not interested in it \u2013 but we\u2019re still all expected to pay. And a lot of towns that are doing really well don\u2019t have Bids. They say they\u2019re transparent and care what businesses think, but the minute I\u2019ve spoke up it feels like they don\u2019t want to listen.\u201d Kevin Jones, chair of the local Bid, says its renewal in 2023 with a 55% turnout showed \u201cconfidence in the concept of Bids and a result of us businesses having worked collectively for the common good of our town over recent years\u201d. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it was creating a \u201cBid innovation forum\u201d with business and local government representatives to see how the model could be improved. \u201cThe department is currently considering whether a review of the Bid arrangements should be undertaken,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe recognise the important role Bids can play in improving the local trading environment and want every Bid to be transparent, accountable and focused on making their local area better for the people living, working and visiting it.\u201d", "date": "2024-04-14", "section": "Business", "author": "Jessica Murray", "id": 147, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b18fcbc018573f6f3c176fd3c3e53220359636b7/0_243_5100_3060/500.jpg"}, {"title": "There\u2019s Always This Year by Hanif Abdurraqib review \u2013 hoop dreams and home truths", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/14/theres-always-this-year-by-hanif-abdurraqib-review-basketball-and-ascension-entertaining-reflections-on-race-place-and-sport", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.09, "neu": 0.71, "pos": 0.201, "compound": 0.9925}, "body": "The literary stamina of Hanif Abdurraqib is impressive. He is the author of two poetry collections and three nonfiction books, plus countless articles, reviews and essays as a music journalist and culture critic for the New York Times, among others. He is also much lauded. Earlier this month he was announced as one of the recipients of a Windham-Campbell prize, and in 2021 was awarded a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant\u201d as well as the Gordon Burn prize for A Little Devil in America: In Praise of Black Performance \u2013 a book in which all his talents came together. Structurally inventive, it is a well-balanced mix of memoir and ruminations on Black American music, culture and history. Some of the essays are built on loose poetic forms and the result is audacious, energetic and playful (and sometimes painful), conjuring the feeling of a writer running for his life, running out of time, running circles around his traumas and joys. There\u2019s Always This Year: On Basketball and Ascension is about \u201cthe emotional politics of place\u201d and what it means to honour (and sometimes be honoured by) our home towns when we leave, and the demons we may have to reckon with when we return. His gaze is turned upwards towards the gods and kings who are basketball players at the top of their game \u2013 men such as LeBron James and Michael Jordan, who are ordained on the court, their image pasted on the walls of bedrooms and prison cells, their performances defying the laws of what is and isn\u2019t possible for mere mortals. As they were born and raised in Ohio a year apart, Abdurraqib blends his own biography with that of James, contrasting the star\u2019s rise with his own less obvious ascent. Abdurraqib was at one point \u201cunhoused\u201d and jailed for petty theft, while the teenage James drove to school in expensive cars even before he made it to the NBA. For him, basketball was \u201chis way out the hood\u201d, while Abdurraqib\u2019s writing talent and emotional intelligence allow him to reframe his circumstances and shortcomings, to honour and grieve them in equal measure. There\u2019s Always This Year stands in opposition to disappearing into depression by revising the rules for Black men, whether they are exceptional or not. Abdurraqib\u2019s approach is at times whimsical and meandering, at others sober and reflective, but almost always self-aware. The American dream promises material rewards for those who strive and hustle hard but, conveniently, doesn\u2019t factor in poverty, race, gender, sexuality, education, disability and neurodiversity, and how they may affect your rise or fall. I read this book while in ascension myself, on a plane to New Orleans, where I first attended an NBA basketball game. There I sat facing the shiny maple wood floor of the Smoothie King Center, home of the New Orleans Pelicans, struck by the athleticism of a sport I knew little of but had read many poems about \u2013 by Terrance Hayes and Inua Ellams, Jim Carroll and Natalie Diaz. Now Abdurraqib, too, captures the experience in the heightened mode of the poet. So much so that by the time my plane descended, I felt invigorated, as if I had been called to reckon with my own gentrified home town and the nostalgia and survivor\u2019s guilt I feel for having left it, despite sometimes longing to return. There\u2019s Always This Year also contains the stories of basketball\u2019s forgotten players, such as Kenny Gregory and Estaban Weaver, the one-time rising stars who fell by the wayside. I felt their tales as powerfully as those of the anointed kings, because Abdurraqib has found an entertaining way to make the act of watching sport akin to witnessing miracles.

(Let\u2019s stop talking about \u2018great\u2019 Britain \u2013 and rebrand ourselves a different sort of country, 11 April). The rebrand must include a rejection of our ridiculous and continuing national claims of exclusiveness and superiority, a recognition that money isn\u2019t quite so important as health and happiness, and that kindness, tolerance and togetherness are ingrained in the collective British blood. I would further insist that no politician is allowed to mention or exemplar the second world war ever again on penalty of long-term exclusion from the House. Britain needs to look out and up, and stride towards its future, not wallow in its past. Jasper Dorgan Edington, Wiltshire \u2022 The first three articles that I read in the Guardian on 11 March reflected different facets of the same problem. Aditya Chakrabortty (on Shildon), Martin Kettle (on \u201cgreat\u201d Britain and realism) and your editorial (on Labour and the tax gap) in different ways ask what sort of Britain do we want to live in? I think for the overwhelming majority, the answer is clear: one that supports deindustrialised communities and all those suffering the negative consequences of globalisation. One that recognises the importance of reasonable tax levels on the wealthy and large corporations in restoring the public realm and public sector. And a Britain that no longer trades on delusions of grandeur, but seeks to play a positive role in world affairs. These are not mutually exclusive but together frame a better future for a \u201cmodest\u201d Britain. Geoff Skinner London \u2022 When William Hague made the speech referred to by Martin Kettle, the then Financial Times Deutschland reported it sardonically under the headline \u201cHague will neues Britisches Reich\u201d (Hague wants a new British empire). The rot leading to Brexit fantasies had begun, and the problem with the idea of Great Britain is far worse than Kettle describes, because consent for the political and cultural construct of Britain exists only in England. Scots overwhelmingly identify as Scottish, not British. The constitutional mechanism already exists for Northern Ireland to quit the UK via a border poll, and without Scotland, Britain is England and Wales, with decreasing certainty the Welsh will continue to accept an English veto indefinitely. The realism that Martin Kettle rightly calls for probably has to go further in recognising that it is England that has to be truthful and realistic about its identity and its place in Europe and the world. Tom Brown London \u2022 Surely, as is made explicit by the French Grande Bretagne (and equivalents in Polish, Romanian etc), the name Great Britain is nothing more than a description of its size compared to Bretagne (Brittany) \u2013 two regions at the oceanic fringe of Europe. Thus the name means nothing more than those of two villages near me \u2013 Great and Little Gransden. No one in our area would imply that these referred to anything more than size. The misuse of Great Britain is thus no more than ignorance or, as is all too common, wilful misinterpretation. Owen Mountford St Neots, Cambridgeshire \u2022 It was inevitable that Britain would suffer from post-imperial decline, exacerbated by the idiocy of Brexit, which ironically was largely supported by people embracing the delusional thought that Britain was still \u201cgreat\u201d. Most nations, I suppose, indulge in some self-aggrandisement, and those wishing to temper such excesses will be accused by rabid rightwingers of national self-hatred. These people cling to a dangerously self-important past. Without it, there is no excuse for their jingoism. Countries where national self-hatred is not tolerated are not better behaved. They are not hard to spot. Jerry Stuart London \u2022 \u201cOccasionally I flirt with the fantasy of a new statute to rename the country as simply Britain.\u201d Isn\u2019t the country correctly named The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland?

You\u2019re Gorgeous was one of around 400 demos I\u2019d recorded on a four-track over five years on the dole in Nottingham. I lived above the Victoria Centre and they decided to replace all the windows, which took a year, so I was trying to record while people were pulling out windows. I wrote the basic skeleton in 30 minutes. The music is very simple and lullaby-esque, a bit of an earworm. The lyrics came quickly because the verses are quite barbed, so I wanted to sweeten them with a chorus to suck people in. The band thought it was a bit of a joke, but the record company thought: \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous \u2013 fantastic!\u201d Even though the verses are insidious. I don\u2019t think a man can call himself a feminist, but it\u2019s meant to be a feminist song. Growing up in the 1970s and 80s, you\u2019d regularly see images of women photographed in bikinis draped over the bonnet of a Ford Capri. I wanted to flip that round and see how the male photographer would feel if he were lying over a car in a thong, to prove how gross it is. I still have people who write to me asking: \u201cWill you sing it at our wedding?\u201d But in it I\u2019m really saying: \u201cYou\u2019re not gorgeous at all.\u201d Years later, living in Manchester, I\u2019d be at a petrol station at 2am and someone would shout: \u201cIt\u2019s Gorgeous Man!\u201d I couldn\u2019t go to a bar without people coming up to me. I\u2019ve had waves in my career, so I always assumed something would replace it. Our single The F-Word was used as the theme tune to Gordon Ramsay\u2019s TV show, and when we worked with Johnny Depp, who plays guitar and directed the video to Unloveable with Stephen Graham in it, I thought, \u201cWhat a relief\u201d, because it took it away from people asking about You\u2019re Gorgeous. But it always comes back. It still gets played. It was played behind Barack Obama on the BBC. Prince William played it when he was DJing. It was used in an advert for Tesco earlier this year. I\u2019m not so stupid as to want to bash people over the head with a message. I\u2019m happy people enjoy it. Stephen Power, producer I\u2019d had a big hit producing Spaceman for Babylon Zoo, for my sins, and had produced Blur\u2019s first single, She\u2019s So High. I\u2019d been offered the Blur album but was already booked to produce this band from Manchester, the Railway Children. I also recorded the original version of Sit Down by James, which has a better groove in my opinion, but couldn\u2019t do their album, either. So they were two big things I\u2019d let slip through my fingers. I\u2019d read in NME about all these independent albums Stephen had recorded, and thought they were incredible: the mixture of his lyrics with these twee, knowing arrangements. I subsequently found out that all these clever arrangements were just the presets on a Yamaha keyboard. All you do is play C, F and G and it instantly gives you a backing track \u2013 a drumbeat and horn parts in different musical styles. But I thought he was a musical genius. I listened to nothing else for months and eventually went to see them play. I was surprised at the look of the band \u2013 all dressed in black. The songs were brilliant. I spoke to the A&amp;R man but was told that they\u2019d decided to go with another producer, so I went home without meeting the band. They recorded a version of You\u2019re Gorgeous and one or two other tracks in a very faithful representation of how the band sounded live, but it didn\u2019t have the quirkiness or character of the stuff Stephen had recorded on his own. When I was brought in, I knew I had to get the band on side. We recorded some tracks with the whole group, including Goodnight, the first single from their 1996 album Ugly Beautiful. But when it came to You\u2019re Gorgeous, I programmed up a version and just got Stephen singing over the top. Everyone loved it. I can remember sitting in a flat in London listening to the chart countdown, thinking: \u201cIt\u2019s not No 5 \u2026 it\u2019s not No 4 \u2026\u201d It went in at No 3, in spite of how dark the lyrics are. I think Stephen was OK with it but the rest of band thought it became a bit of an albatross around the neck. I got on very well with them during the recording but then they wouldn\u2019t speak to me for ages because they thought I\u2019d turned them into a one-hit-wonder band. \u2022 Babybird tour the UK 22 to 31 May", "date": "2024-04-15", "section": "Culture", "author": "Interviews by: Rich Pelley", "id": 152, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/54438bc079c6dc35972b61ddeee6a59c29f7a629/0_108_4038_2423/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Tell us about a favourite beach in Europe \u2013 you could win a \u00a3200 holiday voucher", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/apr/15/tell-us-about-a-favourite-beach-in-europe-you-could-win-a-200-holiday-voucher", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.03, "neu": 0.738, "pos": 0.232, "compound": 0.98}, "body": "What\u2019s your idea of beach heaven?

If One Day (2009) saw Nicholls as a writer in his mid-40s looking back nostalgically on the loves and losses of twentysomethings, here we find him approaching 60 and turning his attention to a couple either side of 40. If One Day was angst and high drama, the setup here is softer and, initially at least, more obviously comic. But the shadow of the earlier novel, of Dexter and Emma\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they romance, hangs over this book. Michael Bradshaw, a geography teacher reeling from a series of personal setbacks, most painfully his separation from soon-to-be ex-wife Natasha, decides to walk Alfred Wainwright\u2019s famous coast to coast path through the Lakes and the Pennines. His happily married colleague Cleo, despairing at his inability to move on, turns what was going to be a solitary excursion into a party. She invites a motley gang along for the first leg of the walk: Conrad, an \u201cabsurdly attractive\u201d pharmacist; Cleo\u2019s taciturn teenage son, Anthony; and Marnie Walsh, a copy editor, \u201caged 38, of Herne Hill, London\u201d. There was supposed to be another friend, Tessa, whom Cleo had invited as a potential match for Michael, but she drops out at the last minute. You Are Here is a great comic novel that also asks the reader to think about the place of humour in fiction: there\u2019s a dangerous proximity throughout the novel between laughter and tears. The narrative moves from Marnie to Michael, short chapters with the close third-person perspective passing like a baton from one to the other (until, at the end, a lovely formal flourish, and a move to Victorian omniscience). Marnie\u2019s chapters show how humour is implicated in the fact that she is lonely: \u201cIf she blinked off the face of the Earth no one in London would notice for several weeks.\u201d She deflates moments of intimacy with laughter, showing both the carapace that a sense of humour can provide, but also how it can ossify, becoming a barrier between Marnie and those who might love her. Michael is more serious, more wounded, aware that his \u201csincerity invites ridicule\u201d. Like Michael, Marnie has been through a failed marriage, although Neil, her ex, is a cartoonish figure, vain and proprietorial. At first, as they set out from the Irish Sea, Marnie is drawn to Conrad, who has come to the mountains in jeans and trainers. He and Marnie are both definitely urban, although she, at least, has come with a good supply of Gore-Tex and an over-large rucksack. Despite the fact that Marnie finds something \u201cpowerfully anti-aphrodisiac about the English countryside\u201d and that Conrad seems like a drip, sparks develop. Michael is always there, though, in the background, looking noble. Partly, it\u2019s that Marnie returns to Michael again and again, her warmly funny descriptions of him drawing us to him and to her in equal measure: \u201cHis face\u2026 had something old-fashioned about it, a kind of crumpled nobility, like someone leading a doomed expedition\u2026 \u201d; later, she says he is \u201chandsome in an old-fashioned way, someone from a sepia photograph whose only mistress is the sea\u201d; he \u201clooked like someone who\u2019d spent a year filming puffins in the Hebrides\u201d. Marnie is only planning to walk the first three days of the trip, but then Conrad drops out, and Cleo departs with Anthony, and Marnie and Michael, both experts at solitude, are alone together. Nicholls is superb on the landscape of this beautiful part of the world. The novel describes two seductions: the first is the mutual, if awkward and bumbling, romance between Michael and Marnie; the second traces Marnie\u2019s reluctant acknowledgment of the sublimity of the countryside. As the pair make their way through the hills and valleys, and Marnie\u2019s self-imposed deadline passes, we find ourselves inhabiting first one, then the other\u2019s perspective, our sympathies tugged in alternate directions. We see how each stands in the way of a shared happy ending and how infuriating this is, how senseless. The reader becomes so invested in the outcome of this unspectacular, everyday, cagoule-clad romance that it makes the whole world shimmer with a kind of secret possibility, as if such narratives are everywhere, just out of sight.

It\u2019s funny and gory, at times sentimental and at other times ridiculous. In other words, it\u2019s just like the games, which veer between quiet, tragic moments exploring the vestiges of America, and being chased down a hill by irradiated scorpions because you\u2019ve run out of ammo. Fallout\u2019s ensemble cast \u2013 with Walton Goggins\u2019 almost-immortal ghoul and Ella Purnell\u2019s wide-eyed vault-dweller the standouts \u2013 lets it cleverly compartmentalise the different aspects of the games\u2019 personality. As its director Jonathan Nolan pointed out, when I interviewed him last week alongside Bethesda\u2019s Todd Howard (the director of the games), this is a common device in TV storytelling but rare in games. Grand Theft Auto V does it successfully: each of the three protagonists represented a different part of GTA\u2019s DNA (Trevor the violent chaos, Michael the prestige crime drama, Franklin the Compton realism). But in most games we play one character, and we know them intimately by the end \u2013 or we get to shape them, and they become unique to us. It makes adapting games for the screen hard. But instead of trying to communicate the experience of playing the games, Fallout steps back to make the broken yet oddly optimistic world of Fallout the star, and each of its characters shows a different side of it. \u201cEven if we had said let\u2019s adapt Fallout 3, whose Fallout 3 are we talking about? Because the way you played that game might have been very different from the way I played that game,\u201d Nolan told me \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of the kind of game [Bethesda] makes \u2026 I\u2019m drawn to the kinds of games where you take full advantage of the medium and decide who your character is going to be within that world. Obviously that doesn\u2019t translate to a series directly.\u201d I was curious: how did Nolan play Fallout 3? \u201cI always play as a boy scout first because I imagine my parents are watching,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I make virtuous decisions, and then I go back through and the second time and I try to play it as a total heel. But then I get weirded out and squeamish and end up in the morally compromised middle area. It\u2019s a bit pathetic.\u201d I can relate. I\u2019m a chaotic good kind of player in most games that allow for it: I\u2019ll make a mess everywhere I go and happily align myself against any character or faction in authority, but I\u2019ll never do anything that would hurt people. I know that games are supposed to be consequence-free places where you can experiment with morality, but I cannot bring myself to play the villain. This contrasts with a lot of players I know, who will immediately set about causing chaos in a game world just to see what will happen. The kind of person who shoots horses in Red Dead Redemption. \u201cEvery time you get a game and you test it, you\u2019re immediately like, what will this game let me do? No matter what we do, every time, we\u2019ll hand a player a weapon, they will shoot the first person they see,\u201d Todd Howard says with a laugh. \u201cIt could be their mother. They will shoot whoever it is. And then they\u2019ll be like, oh well, I\u2019ll just reload.\u201d It must be a nightmare trying to design a choice-based game around players\u2019 random whims, but Howard and Bethesda have decades of experience with that. When I\u2019ve interviewed him over the years, he has often spoken eloquently about how players and systems interact to create emergent stories, and how games can uniquely make you feel as if what you\u2019re doing within them is real and meaningful. TV and film can\u2019t do that. But as the Fallout show proves, if they\u2019re made by people who really get it, they can tell a story of their own that still communicates what it is about the games that people love. The reason Fallout is good \u2013 and this applies to the other successful game-to-screen adaptations in recent years, too \u2013 is not that it looks right, that the sets are perfect, or that they\u2019ve nailed the retro-futurist nostalgic aesthetic of the games. It\u2019s that Nolan and writers Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner actually played and understood Fallout, and felt the power of its storytelling for themselves. Instead of trying to awkwardly adapt a game story into a TV script, they\u2019ve written brilliant, extremely high-budget extended fan-fiction of the games. I\u2019m all for this approach. Now that we have a generation of TV and filmmakers who\u2019ve grown up with games and truly understand them, I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll see more of it.

It\u2019s too silly to be that scary, encouraging players to ham things up for the camera, and naturally it\u2019s well-suited to streaming \u2013 a game without much substance, but with enough unique fun in its premise to last at least a few rounds.

Her second, The Hypocrite, is a novel about a play about a novel. It begins with a mother on a beach in Sicily watching her husband and toddler daughter paddling. The mother doesn\u2019t much like the father, who \u201cworked on his novel in the other room\u201d for much of the holiday. She resents her invisibility. And then we skip to 2020, London, and an autobiographical play cautiously produced in semi-lockdown, in which a teenage Sophia and her father stay in a borrowed villa on a Sicilian island in August. The stage father is writing a novel, or mostly dictating it for the stage daughter to type. His novel is about a novelist having sexual adventures while taking a holiday on a Sicilian island. While the adult Sophia\u2019s father watches the play, Sophia herself has lunch with her mother. Sophia and her mother discuss, over a lot of wine and some barely touched Italian food, Sophia\u2019s father\u2019s probable reaction to seeing himself and his writing and his relationship with his daughter performed on stage. Sophia\u2019s father is indeed dismayed by her representation of him and his work, and becomes increasingly distressed as he wanders London after the play rejecting her increasingly anxious calls. It\u2019s all less confusing, though no less tricksy, than it sounds. The various timelines run smoothly and there is no difficulty in distinguishing the present moments of the novel and the play from the past moments they represent, even though we see the versions of the teenage holiday that Sophia and her father remember as well as the versions they present in fiction and on stage: no objective truth here. Father and daughter have incompatible but overlapping memories of the central trip to Italy; we understand that Sophia has not told him about the unpleasant and not always consensual relationship she had with the housekeeper\u2019s teenage son. For both of them, memory lives in uneasy and unresolved relation to writing. The young adult Sophia\u2019s play might be revenge for her father\u2019s carelessness and neglect, or might just be art made of life. If it\u2019s revenge, it might be a misuse of art (and funding), or it might be reasonable, natural or clever. To Sophia\u2019s mother, it\u2019s all rather tedious, but to Sophia and her father, the stakes are high, and for Sophia and at least some of her generation, the high personal stakes make the art more important. For her father\u2019s generation, the high personal stakes diminish artistry; it doesn\u2019t matter what happened but how good the writing is. Potential Marxist criticism is anticipated through a young woman, known only as Round Glasses, sitting beside Sophia\u2019s father in the audience. During the interval they converse over cigarettes and Round Glasses complains, \u201cHistorically people like you and your daughter have had enough money and attention to last you a lifetime. The kind of suffering you describe doesn\u2019t hold a candle to what I mean \u2026 Not everyone has the luxury of writing Hampstead sex romps via holidays in Italy.\u201d Sophia\u2019s father replies that \u201call of your opinions are rephrased junk from strangers who pour their heart out via globalised American media conglomerates on the internet\u201d. Hamya\u2019s defensive impulse is understandable \u2013 this is a book about the genteel violence at the heart of the bourgeois family and the novel\u2019s engine is the artistic representation of holidays in Italy \u2013 but it might work better to own the situation, rather than simultaneously pre-empting and satirising generational difference. For readers uninterested in or impatient with questions about the ethics of art and life, and the Russian dolls of books about plays about books, Sophia\u2019s mother is probably right. If you enjoy novels about the suffering of the bourgeoisie, part of your pleasure in the tradition is probably the invitation to feel warmth for at least some of the characters at least some of the time. No one here is likable, not, I think, because Hamya fails to make them likable, but because she is satirising her own medium and doesn\u2019t try. If you find sufficient pleasure in satire and meta-narrative to dispense with old-fashioned relationships with characters, and are not put off by a Hampstead sex romp via holidays in Italy, this is a well-wrought and very clever book. \u2022 The Hypocrite by Jo Hamya is published by W&amp;N (\u00a318.99).

One of more than 2,000 UK companies with B Corp status, it has been certified as a company that\u2019s dedicated to being accountable and improving its social and environmental impact \u2013 and one of the ways it ensures it\u2019s improving its social impact at grassroots level is through its payback scheme. Customers of giffgaff (known as \u201cmembers\u201d) can earn payback points in various ways \u2013 from inviting friends to join the network to helping out the rest of the community. Then, twice a year, these points can be cashed in, used as credit or donated to charity \u2013 and if you choose to donate your points, giffgaff matches your donation pound for pound. \u201cPayback is one of the most exciting projects to be a part of,\u201d says Roxy Baciu, head of community at giffgaff. \u201cIt allows us to bring our values to life in a genuine and relevant way.\u201d Keen to know more? Here are three regional community projects that the giffgaff community has supported so far. Hampshire Search and Rescue Rescue volunteering is an incredibly important job, so it\u2019s great to hear that Hampshire Search and Rescue received 10% of the overall donation pot from giffgaff members matched by giffgaff. There are Lowland rescue groups operating all over the UK, and volunteers are on call to the police 24/7, every day of the year. This round-the-clock availability means they can be deployed quickly to search for vulnerable missing persons in greater numbers than are possibly available within police forces, making them a vital resource. Volunteers have to train for up to six months, so it\u2019s a commitment, but a worthy one. \u201cWe get to know each other, we work well together, and look after each other,\u201d says Hampshire vice chair Trevor Vidler. Hampshire Search and Rescue has been called out 19 times so far in 2024. Neighbouring counties can call upon search and rescue communities to send reinforcements, and Dorset and Wiltshire often ask Hampshire for backup. As for how Hampshire is planning to spend its donation from giffgaff, Vidler says: \u201cOur vehicles are kept in the south of the county, and it sometimes takes us a while to get the equipment we need to the north, so this money will help us to buy and equip another 4x4 to be kept in north Hampshire. This will significantly shorten the time it takes for us to arrive on scene when we\u2019re needed in the area.\u201d Thames Valley Positive Support Set up in 1985, in the early years of what was to become the Aids epidemic, Thames Valley Positive Support (TVPS) \u2013 which received 5% of the overall donation pot from giffgaff members matched by giffgaff \u2013 was initially established to support people living with HIV and Aids in the Slough/Windsor area. Today, as well as continuing to support people coming to terms with an HIV diagnosis \u2013 helping them to connect with others who are affected by the virus, and offering advice on debt, benefits and housing \u2013 TVPS also provides space for the wider LGBTQ+ community to meet locally. \u201cThere was nowhere for this group to meet where they could be themselves,\u201d says Sarah Macadam, chief executive at TVPS. \u201cWe set up this safe space for anyone to come and socialise, and it has since grown into peer support and counselling.\u201d The charity has found that peer support is by far the most popular and effective service it offers, and it also enables people to seek counsel outside traditional working hours. \u201cBeing someone who offers peer support can be a very empowering and rewarding experience,\u201d Macadam says. The funding received from giffgaff will be spent on training and travel costs for people who want to become peer supporters \u2013 half for people who have HIV, and half for the LGBTQ+ community. Animals in Need As with the other organisations giffgaff customers have donated to, Animals in Need relies entirely on donations to keep its services going \u2013 so it was delighted to receive 40% of the overall donation pot from giffgaff members matched by giffgaff. Animals in Need rescues wild and domestic animals across Northamptonshire, and provides rehabilitation services at its headquarters, Pine Tree Farm. \u201cAfter Covid, it was younger animals, but now we\u2019re rescuing more older animals with medical conditions who require more complex care,\u201d says Louise Smith, marketing and communications officer. The voluntary organisation rehabilitates and rehomes dogs (of which they currently have about 50), cats, farm animals and wildlife such as hedgehogs. The focus of its work is always to get the animals on the road to recovery and back out to homes, or to the wild. Money from giffgaff will be used on a number of ongoing projects at the farm \u2013 reroofing part of the kennels in the dog isolation and medical block and improving the dog sensory garden, which provides the dogs they rescue with enrichment training with different textures.

The offer follows nearly four months of exclusive talks between the two lenders, which began in December. If a deal is completed, it would create a new high street challenger with almost 5 million customers and an \u00a389bn balance sheet However, there are likely to be weeks of negotiation ahead before a deal can be finalised and both groups have stressed that there was still \u201cno certainty at this stage\u201d that a takeover would take place. The \u201cnon-binding\u201d offer signals that enough due diligence has been done over the last three months to convince the management of Coventry, and the Co-operative Bank\u2019s hedge fund owners, that a deal could be in their best interests. \u201cWe have a very successful history, and we believe this could be the basis of a very successful future \u2013 with membership, great value and great service at its heart,\u201d Coventry Building Society\u2019s chief executive, Steve Hughes, said. \u201cThe Co-operative Bank is a financially stable, profitable organisation with a shared heritage and products and services that complement our own \u2026 we\u2019re confident that we have the people, capability and the financial strength to bring both organisations together successfully over a number of years.\u201d The two sides will now continue talks, and said that they were \u201cworking together to enter into definitive agreements in due course\u201d. \u201cA further announcement will be made as appropriate,\u201d they added. The prospective deal adds to a wave of consolidation among UK lenders, and follows Barclays\u2019 purchase of Tesco Bank in February for \u00a3700m, and Nationwide Building Society\u2019s \u00a32.9bn takeover of rival Virgin Money, which was agreed in March. But, like its fellow building society Nationwide, Coventry has decided not to give its members a vote on the potential deal, saying it is not required under the Building Societies Act. \u201cIn coming to this decision, the board has been informed by member surveys and focus groups, which clearly signalled their priorities as maintaining our value proposition and service quality,\u201d Coventry said. The Co-operative Bank has been fielding takeover offers since at least 2020, when it was approached by the New York-based private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which offered a mere \u00a3270m. But its owners \u2013 Silver Point Capital, GoldenTree, Anchorage Capital, JC Flowers and Bain Capital Credit, Cyrus Capital and the fund manager Invesco \u2013 have been more open to a deal since the bank returned to profit in 2021, which has helped improve its potential price tag. The bank traces its origins to the 1872 establishment of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, the body that would become the Co-operative Group, and provided financial services to the wider co-operative movement in Britain, in which member-owned businesses worked for the common good. However, it ran into trouble when a \u00a31.5bn hole was discovered in its accounts after its disastrous takeover of the Britannia Building Society in 2009. The problem resulted in the bank separating from the Co-operative Group and being rescued by the consortium of hedge funds, which took full control in 2017. Its reputation also suffered after its former chair, the ex-Labour councillor and Methodist church minister Paul Flowers \u2013 nicknamed the \u201cCrystal Methodist\u201d \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine in 2014.

Kerry Kennedy, one of six siblings of the controversial candidate on stage at a Biden campaign event in Philadelphia, called the US president \u201cmy hero\u201d as she celebrated a litany of his achievements she said would have pleased her father, the late former US attorney general Robert F Kennedy and late uncle and president John F Kennedy. Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968 while running for president, less than five years after his elder brother John was assassinated in Dallas. \u201cPresident Biden has been a champion for all the rights and freedoms that my father and uncle stood for,\u201d Kerry Kennedy said. \u201cThat\u2019s why nearly every single grandchild of Joe and Rose Kennedy supports Joe Biden. That\u2019s right, the Kennedy family endorses Joe Biden for president,\u201d she added, referring to JFK and RFK\u2019s parents. Speaking moments later, Biden said it was \u201can incredible honor\u201d to have their support, and called it the most meaningful introduction he had ever received, other than one from his sister. \u201cThe 2024 election is about two fundamentally different visions for America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s vision is one of anger, hate, revenge and retribution. He embraces the insurrection of January 6, he\u2019s running on it, and has promised to be a dictator on day one. \u201cHe calls for another bloodbath when he loses again. Your family, the Kennedy family, has endured such violence. I have a very different view of America. One of hope and optimism, like I hope all of you do, an optimism Bobby Kennedy embodied.\u201d Neither directly mentioned the candidacy of RFK Jr, which Biden\u2019s supporters fear will drain vital votes from the president in November. But, Kerry Kennedy said: \u201cIn 2024 there are only two candidates with any chance of winning.\u201d Attacking Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, she said he was \u201cthe most anti-democratic president\u201d in history, and that his \u201coutrageous lies and behavior would have horrified my father\u201d. \u201cDaddy stood for equal justice, for human rights, and freedom from want and fear, just as President Biden does today,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald Trump mocks these values, just as he mocks our system of laws. He predicted a bloodbath if he loses the election. We cannot afford to ignore his warning.\u201d In all, 15 Kennedy family members were present at what amounted to a show of strength against their relative, whose racist conspiracy theories over Covid and vaccinations, among other issues, they have previously denounced as \u201cdeplorable\u201d. Although Kerry Kennedy, a noted human rights activist, avoided talking about her brother in her speech, she was asked in a CNN interview earlier on Thursday for thoughts on his campaign. \u201cWe have a big family and we have a lot of discussions. Today is not about my brother Bobby. Today is about America, it\u2019s about freedom, it\u2019s about democracy,\u201d she said. RFK Jr acknowledged his family\u2019s position in a tweet posted before the Biden campaign event. \u201cI hear some of my family will be endorsing President Biden today.

Supposedly his wife, and even management, begged him not to do it, \u201cDON\u2019T READ HIS TRUTH, JIMMY, PLEASE DON\u2019T DO THIS,\u201d they said. He was made to look like a FOOL, which he is, and at the same time go down in Television History as the WORST HOST EVER OF THE ONCE VAUNTED ACADEMY AWARDS!\u201d The post was \u201cnot just wrong\u201d, Kimmel retorted, \u201cbut \u2018maybe we should be worried about him\u2019 wrong. Like \u2018maybe we should take the keys away from grandpa\u2019 wrong.\u201d Kimmel did a line-by-line fact check, starting with the fact that ratings actually went up by 4% this year. As for \u201cTrump Derangement Syndrome\u201d \u2013 \u201cnow that is false\u201d, he said. \u201cThere is only one person who suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome, and his name is Donald Trump.\u201d Kimmel also took issue with Trump\u2019s incorrect recollection that he presented the award for best picture, which was actually presented by Al Pacino. \u201cI didn\u2019t open the envelope,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even touch the envelope. I did not present the award for best picture. I am not Al Pacino. Maybe you dreamed this during one of your courtroom siestas? I don\u2019t know. \u201cThis man, who was our president, is on trial with 34 criminal charges against him, and he\u2019s still mad about the Oscars!\u201d he marveled. \u201cThis was five weeks ago. My parents don\u2019t even care any more! The only person still talking about this joke is him.

Initially I laughed it off as drunken ramblings, but he then proceeded to show me the actual document, saved on his phone with comments next to people\u2019s names. I learned that he keeps a running score of his friends based on how often they WhatsApp him, take the time to call him or go to the pub or on a trip abroad together. At first I found the whole idea amusing and was actually pleased to see I ranked quite highly in his \u201cfriendship matrix\u201d, as he likes to call it. However, the more I thought about it, the more anxious and worried I became. I live abroad and don\u2019t get to see my friend all that often, so now I\u2019m slightly terrified I will be relegated to a lower rank and overtaken by other friends who might have more time for him. Is this a normal thing for someone to do? I don\u2019t know. But what I do know is that it has become a source of worry to me. Should I bring up the subject with him, or is it best to leave it be? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal, but I have never heard of it before. I\u2019m sure readers will fill in any gaps. I think some people keep a mental tally of \u201cthat friend is really reliable/best in person/for a fun night out\u201d etc, but to commit it to paper seems time consuming at best. As I have got older, I have thought more about motivation, and I wonder what your friend\u2019s was for doing this. Is it, perhaps, so he can make sure he is an equally good friend to people he thinks merit it? I went to the UKCP-registered psychotherapist Ryan Bennett-Clarke. He felt this was a \u201ccurious process, which may be a manifestation of fear, insecurity, a need for power or even being passive-aggressive. As in: instead of your friend expressing any dissatisfaction directly, it becomes displaced in this \u2018friendship matrix\u2019.\u201d Bennett-Clarke went on to wonder if this was your friend\u2019s idea of \u201crighting historic wrongs by displacing anger and punishment on to people in the present, rather than confronting hurt and disappointment from the past\u201d. Someone might do this if they are unable, for whatever reason, to bring up how they feel to the person involved. This secret \u201cleague table\u201d may make your friend feel powerful. Of course, we cannot rule out neurodivergence and your friend simply keeping up with friendships so that he can reciprocate. And in some cases of neurodivergence, things like friendship, which have a high emotional currency, can be treated as more transactional. The thing is, friendships are hard to quantify. Some people you only hear from occasionally but you know would absolutely be there for you if needed. Some can text every day but are as flakey as a good millefeuille when the chips are down. We could muse for a while about the why, but should you say anything to him? Bennett-Clarke felt this could be helpful. After all, there may have been a reason your friend showed you this. Maybe you could use it as a springboard to talk about not only why your friend has this spreadsheet, but also what friendship means. \u201cThis could be an opportunity to facilitate a meaningful dialogue about friendship and realistic expectations.\u201d I wasn\u2019t so sure. Your friend may deny it or say he doesn\u2019t keep it any more, and I think this may lead to more unrest within you. I agree that a meaningful discussion would be really therapeutic and interesting, but I worry this would be hard to achieve given what you have told me about your friend. And it may then become a \u201cthing\u201d between you, where you are always asking where you are in the league table. I suppose, going back to the motivation: do you think your friend was showing you as a power move, or to include you? You also need to consider why this bothers you so much. We are far more than rankings on someone\u2019s list (which, anyway, would be highly subjective). That said, a little restorative justice might be useful \u2013 you could mentally think of your own matrix and wonder where you would put your friend.

Now I\u2019m as bald as an egg, I couldn\u2019t be happier, 16 April). However, unfortunately I think in this case Mr Heritage is still in denial of his true bald status, despite his conclusions. Let\u2019s not beat about the bush here: I\u2019m talking about compensatory facial hair syndrome (CFHS). Admittedly it\u2019s mild compared with some upside-down heads \u2013 usually paired with a lumberjack shirt, a style of shirt that I can clearly see in Mr Heritage\u2019s now redundant profile picture. I suspect he is in the first stages of CFHS. How do I know? I too suffered from this debilitating affliction. I also suffer from compensatory thick-rimmed glasses syndrome (CTRGS). Now, I\u2019ve kept CFHS in check by trimming my facial hair to grade 3, but I\u2019m told there is nothing I can do about CTRGS. Mr Heritage would do well to use his platform for public information to bring these further side-effects to the public\u2019s attention. On numerous occasions I have tried to quietly live my life, only to have someone shout at me in the street \u201cOi, Gregg Wallace!\u201d Anthony Nash Beckenham, London \u2022 Welcome, Stuart! I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s finally made the transition to fully committed baldness, and written about the process so insightfully as well. My early 20s were among the most angst-ridden years of my life as I watched my hair slowly but inevitably abandon me. Like Stuart, when I finally shaved my head and accepted my fate, the sense of release was overwhelming. Now in my mid-30s, I have friends who are on to their second or third hair transplants, and the thought that they have been in bald purgatory all this time makes me really sad. The hair-growth industry has no permanent solutions to baldness: it can only prolong your misery. Hugo Legge London \u2022 Stuart Heritage\u2019s article exactly mirrors my experience, with one notable exception \u2013 I embraced the baldness at the earliest opportunity, when I was 26. I had the benefit of always having hated my dead-straight hair for as long as I could remember, so whipping it all off was an absolute pleasure. Now in my late 40s, I sit in the waiting area of the local barber while my two young sons have a trim and think: \u201cGod, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in that pneumatic chair, and I hope they won\u2019t need to be at my age either.\u201d My wife never knew me pre-egghead, and after sniggering at my hirsute university photos, she is glad that she didn\u2019t. Mike Wayne Cranleigh, Surrey \u2022 After two or three decades as a bald chap, I can confirm Stuart Heritage\u2019s discovery that there are many advantages. One of the main ones is that you get to shed any residual worries over what other people think of your appearance \u2013 they really don\u2019t care. Pretty much the only disadvantage is that you bang your head more often. Hair acts as an early-warning system. Without it, the first you realise that the shed door is a bit lower than you think is when you smack into it. But the occasional scab on the top of your head is a small price to pay in comparison with the vast savings to be made in having zero hair maintenance costs. Paul Dixon East Hagbourne, Oxfordshire \u2022 As a now nearly completely hairless man with alopecia areata, I can attest to the following positivities of my condition: 1) I get out of the shower, I\u2019m dry; 2) no more faffing about in hairdressers; 3) if you find a hair in your food, it\u2019s not mine; 4) I swim faster; 5) my legs look good in a dress. And there\u2019s also the wonderful moment when I tell people I\u2019ve got alopecia and you see them wondering whether to ask if it extends to the nether regions. Mostly they don\u2019t ask, but when they do, I never tell! Sam Heath London \u2022 I\u2019ve been happily bald for more than 20 years. As is so often the case, a random comment changed everything for me. I was chatting anxiously with the hairdresser about my hair loss, and he said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you have a lovely shaped head.\u201d This may or may not be the case, but I have lived hair-and worry-free ever since.

The title track seems to mock one such tortured poet who carts a typewriter around and likens the budding couple to Patti Smith and Dylan Thomas. \u201cWe\u2019re modern idiots,\u201d Swift laughs. The album\u2019s aesthetic wallows in anguish and Swift\u2019s liner notes and social media captions are littered with self-consciously poetic proclamations. And the erratic period captured in the lyrics couldn\u2019t be further from a life of cloistered studiousness. TTPD depicts a manic phase in Swift\u2019s life last year, the reality behind the perfect stagecraft of the Eras tour. Wild-eyed from what sounds like the slow dissolution of a six-year relationship, she lunged at a once-forbidden paramour with a taste for dissolution, a foul mouth and a well-founded bad reputation. The latter, she makes clear as she sings repeatedly about flouting paternalistic and public censure, was a central part of the attraction: \u201cHe was chaos, he was revelry,\u201d Swift sings on But Daddy I Love Him (evidently about the 1975\u2019s Matty Healy). Perhaps inevitably, she got burned, causing wounds that are now healed: \u201cAnd upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted,\u201d she wrote in a new Instagram caption, with a primness that belies the unbridled hunger behind the album\u2019s lyrics. \u201cGrowing up precocious sometimes means / Not growing up at all,\u201d Swift sings on But Daddy I Love Him, a self-aware remark about how living up to adults\u2019 expectations of maturity can prevent developing it on your own terms \u2013 repression primed to explode. In outlook, the contents of TTPD are quite thrillingly immature. Swift captures that unhinged period after a big breakup when your centre is gone and with it any sense of reason; when friends\u2019 concerns go unheeded, horniness is high and oblivion has never looked more inviting. She reveals on Guilty as Sin? that fantasising over the idea of someone helped liberate her from her stultifying long-term relationship. And once imagination has sprung you Fresh Out the Slammer, as she sings \u2013 \u201cGet the matches / Toss the ashes off the ledge\u201d \u2013 you can easily get high on the idea of where else wishful thinking might take you: \u201cI can fix him / No really, I can,\u201d she sings on a song of the same name. The short length of the tryst in question \u2013 six to eight weeks in the public eye, at any rate \u2013 just ups the volatility, and the word \u201ccrazy\u201d appears repeatedly. The delulu era had found its soundtrack \u2013 or at least it would have if TTPD sounded anything like as feral and feckless as its themes. Since 2020\u2019s Folklore and Evermore, Swift\u2019s only co-producers have been Jack Antonoff and the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner. TTPD largely bobs between their sounds, muting Antonoff\u2019s gated Bleachers boom and stretching Dessner\u2019s composerly intricacy to pop heights it can\u2019t quite buoy. It drains the sparkle from both, and seems to beat a bruised retreat that structurally confines the lacerating lyrics. It\u2019s a strange contrast. Maybe there is some kind of logic in it. The post-high crash is prone to leave you feeling flayed, grasping at familiarity. Moreover, following rejection in love and by a public who threw tantrums over her association with Healy, perhaps the fame-weary TTPD marks Swift taking her ball home: the sole upbeat moment, I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, sparkles with satire and finds Swift taunting fans as she reveals that she was psychotically miserable as she still hit her marks on the Eras tour once Healy had left the frame. \u201cYou know you\u2019re good,\u201d she smirks. \u201cAnd I\u2019m good.\u201d Revealing that she can play the role perfectly well when she wants to suggests that she really, really doesn\u2019t want to on TTPD. But that logic doesn\u2019t quite hold when you consider how the album conforms to the demands of the wider entertainment ecosystem. Given Swift\u2019s scale, she can hardly slip out a record below the radar. But at 2am EST on Friday, she revealed that TTPD was in fact a double album \u2013 the second half closer to the fictional narratives of 2020\u2019s Folklore and Evermore than the sharp disclosures of the first \u2013 and added 15 additional songs to streaming services. Swift\u2019s streaming dominance makes it easy to forget that a decade ago she pulled her music from Spotify, lambasting them for monetarily devaluing music, and wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that she perceived the value of an album to be \u201cthe amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work\u201d. (She returned in 2017.) Where her pre-2020 albums stuck to a pretty tight artistic vision, the inessential 31-track sprawl of TTPD just feels as though it feeds a streaming machine where volume is everything. And as much as elements of TTPD exhibit a distaste for the conversation around her \u2013 Who\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me? follows Blank Space and Look What You Made Me Do in satirising her reputation by embodying it \u2013 it also feeds a gossip-focused media. Naturally, Swift should write about her life however she wants, and her fame means that even her most inscrutable lyrics will be scoured for \u201cclues\u201d (although she has said she\u2019s \u201ctrained\u201d fans to behave that way by leaving crumb trails everywhere). But there comes a point when she\u2019s rehashing ancient battles \u2013 take a deep breath and spell out the highlighted letters in thanK you aIMee, as she styles it, from the album\u2019s second side \u2013 and you have to ask why. The likely answer feels dispiriting. Although the song is a backhanded message of gratitude for \u201cthe way you made me heal\u201d, it also doubtless lights the way to the release of Reputation (Taylor\u2019s Version), the re-recording of her 2017 retort to the Kim and Kanye drama likely due later this year. Much as parts of TTPD rebuke parts of her audience for revealing the conditions by which they\u2019re willing to accept her, it still keeps both parties trapped in the dance that created that entitlement. Even in such a loose record, Swift is unwilling to relinquish her trademark Easter eggs (But Daddy I Love Him references The Little Mermaid, released in her birth year/album title 1989, as was the Blue Nile\u2019s The Downtown Lights, cited in Guilty as Sin?) and each discovery of a new one hits like a hammered nail. The allusions and retreads play into an IP mentality (surely when the Eras tour resumes in Paris in May, the setlist will get a TTPD refresh) as well as the assumption she once rejected that her songs are puzzles to be solved. They\u2019re not hard to solve these days. The Alchemy, full of football metaphors, couldn\u2019t be about anything but Swift\u2019s current relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. \u201cSo when I touch down / Call the amateurs and cut \u2018em from the team / Ditch the clowns, get the crown,\u201d she sings. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on a winning streak.\u201d After toying with a reckless kind of freedom, triumph is a retreat to first principles, a game she knows inside out. For all the online guides discerning the veracity of each song, it\u2019s ultimately the risk aversion of The Tortured Poets Department that undermines its unvarnished truths.", "date": "2024-04-19", "section": "Music", "author": "Laura Snapes", "id": 165, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/560df64aa58b9ffd8cb7141de6424354c643e40b/0_0_2048_1229/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Play aims to unravel mystery of poet Nan Shepherd\u2019s masterwork", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/apr/19/play-unravel-mystery-poet-nan-shepherd-masterwork", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.064, "neu": 0.717, "pos": 0.219, "compound": 0.9957}, "body": "Nan Shepherd, the Scottish poet and nature writer whose vivid reflections on her treks through the Cairngorms have brought posthumous acclaim, is celebrated in a new play that aims to unravel the mystery of why her masterwork remained unpublished in a drawer for 30 years. Shepherd is recognisable to many from her striking pose on the Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u00a35 note after preceding Jane Austen by a year to become the first female writer on British paper currency. While she enjoyed bursts of public recognition in her lifetime, it is since her death in 1981, and the 2011 republication of her seminal meditation on the Cairngorm range, The Living Mountain, that she has reached a global audience. \u201cIt\u2019s a rollercoaster from complete celebrity to utter neglect,\u201d said Dr Kerri Andrews, who edited Shepherd\u2019s correspondence for publication last year and worked on the play, Nan Shepherd: Naked and Unashamed, which is directed by Richard Baron, and co-produced by Pitlochry Festival theatre and Firebrand Theatre Company. Shepherd, who was born in the village of West Cults, near Aberdeen, in 1893, had established her literary reputation by her early 30s with a trio of modernist novels, exploring women\u2019s shifting roles in rural communities, that drew comparisons with Virginia Woolf. Then followed a collection of poetry, In the Cairngorms, and The Living Mountain, completed during the second world war, which \u201cwent into a drawer\u201d \u2013 as she later described it \u2013 for more than three decades after a publisher\u2019s rejection. \u201cShe had huge early success in the 20s and 30s with her poetry and novels, with people reading and writing about her. Then it\u2019s like she drops off the face of the Earth,\u201d said Andrews. \u201cBut of course she doesn\u2019t. She writes to the poet Hugh MacDiarmid that she had \u201cgone dumb\u201d, but she had other things in her life \u2013 her teaching and lectures, her support for younger writers, like Jessie Kesson. She had a lifelong commitment to Scottish literature.\u201d Charting significant episodes and relationships in Shepherd\u2019s life, the play endeavours to reflect all these facets of the author, teacher, hillwalker, friend and lover. There are contradictions, too, said Baron. She travelled widely and read deeply, from Marx to Buddhism, but only ever lived in the same village. \u201cShe had a rebellious nature, going out on her own into the hills, and also engaged in a love triangle with her best friend\u2019s husband. She was doing things outside of what you might expect from a middle-class teacher.\u201d There is still a mystery as to why the manuscript languished for so long, and what prompted Shepherd to resurrect it in 1977, when it was quietly published by the University of Aberdeen, where she is remembered for giving theatrical lectures on literature well into her 80s. One theory is that she was irritated by a headline on a final interview she gave to a local newspaper, labelling her as \u201cthe genius who gave up\u201d. Others suggest that Shepherd, an intensely private woman who found fulsome praise discomfiting, rather relished her retreat from the spotlight and arm\u2019s-length role of mentor. But her decision to finally publish The Living Mountain cemented her legacy. Shepherd was also a writer of unfettered sensuality \u2013 luxuriating in the senses and detailing physical pleasure at a time when women were not encouraged to share such experiences so candidly. In The Living Mountain she describes \u201cdried mud flats, sun-warmed, have a delicious touch, cushioned and smooth; so has long grass at morning, hot in the sun, but still cool and wet when the foot sinks into it, like food melting to a new flavour in the mouth\u201d. She also suggests \u201ca much more humble, equitable and gentle way of interacting with nature\u201d, said Andrews, \u201cthat is not macho or about climbing the highest peaks\u201d. As Shepherd herself put it: \u201cTo aim for the highest point is not the only way to climb a mountain.\u201d", "date": "2024-04-19", "section": "Stage", "author": "Libby Brooks Scotland correspondent", "id": 166, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1680aeccdc55dbb03bf2bcdc386f4b6261b585b9/0_56_1139_683/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Amazon UK could be forced to recognise union as GMB wins right to hold ballot", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/19/amazon-uk-recognise-union-gmb-ballot-coventry-warehouse", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.112, "neu": 0.662, "pos": 0.226, "compound": 0.9897}, "body": "Amazon could be forced to recognise a trade union for the first time in the UK after members of the GMB at the internet retailer\u2019s Coventry warehouse were granted permission to hold a legally binding ballot. The Central Arbitration Committee (CAC), the independent statutory body that adjudicates on collective bargaining rights, has ruled that a vote should be held at the site to test support for union recognition. A win would give the GMB the right to discuss terms and conditions such as pay, hours and holidays with Amazon. The union has held a series of strikes at the Coventry unit since January last year, demanding a pay rise to \u00a315 an hour and a seat round the table in negotiations with management. Amanda Gearing, a GMB senior organiser, said: \u201cFrom day one of GMB\u2019s fight for union rights at Amazon it has been a modern-day David and Goliath battle. One year on this is a truly historic moment as workers stand up against the company\u2019s relentless anti-union propaganda.\u201d The union withdrew an application for statutory union recognition to the CAC last year, accusing Amazon of drafting in more than 1,000 extra staff members to skew the decision \u2013 something the retailer has denied. After a concerted recruitment campaign at the vast warehouse, the GMB made a second application last month, believing it had signed up more than half the staff. In a decision statement issued on Thursday, the CAC said it had not found that 50% of workers were members \u2013 which could have prompted it to impose recognition immediately \u2013 but accepted the GMB\u2019s bid for a ballot to be held. The detail of the watchdog\u2019s statement underlined the tensions between union and employer, with Amazon accusing the GMB of making \u201cextremely serious and untrue accusations\u201d, with the \u201culterior motive\u201d of trying to influence the CAC panel. The CAC will appoint an independent person to carry out the vote, which would then be expected to happen within 20 working days. To secure recognition, the GMB will need to win a majority of support in the ballot. The \u201cyes\u201d voters must also represent at least 40% of the workers on site. The CAC\u2019s case manager, who took evidence from the union and Amazon, found that the GMB currently represents 35.62% of the 3,088 workers in the proposed bargaining unit, suggesting the union has a fight on its hands. Amazon said its employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe regularly review our pay to ensure we offer competitive wages and benefits. Our minimum starting pay has increased to \u00a312.30 and \u00a313 an hour depending on location, that\u2019s a 20% increase over two years and 50% since 2018.

But she\u2019s never openly condemned her listeners before her new album The Tortured Poets Department, in songs that constitute some of its most daring moments. Who\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me? feels like a deservedly bitter, barbed update of the cutesier and more cloying Anti-Hero that suggests Swift is the way she is because of the twisted culture she grew up in and had to contort herself to fit into: \u201cYou taught me, you caged me, and then you called me crazy,\u201d she seethes, sounding quite high on the fearsome power commentators have ascribed to her. Most thrilling is But Daddy I Love Him, named after a line that astute listeners will recognise from The Little Mermaid as Ariel protests to King Triton that she\u2019s in love with landlubbing human Eric. It\u2019s very clearly about the pearl-clutching that transpired when Swift started dating Matty Healy of the 1975 last spring. She was fresh out of a six-year relationship with actor Joe Alwyn; Healy was in trouble for laughing at racist jokes on a podcast, an incident that led concerned Swift fans to dig up his previous controversies and pen (pathetic) open letters petitioning her to break up with him. The song hints that even her management and family tried to get her to end it (\u201csoon enough the elders had convened down at the city hall\u201d). But Healy\u2019s notoriety, the song makes clear, was partially the point: \u201cHe was chaos / he was revelry,\u201d she sings ecstatically, then directs her ire to the \u201cSarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best\u201d and the \u201cwine moms\u201d castigating her choices: I\u2019ll tell you something right now I\u2019d rather burn my whole life down Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning I\u2019ll tell you something about my good name It\u2019s mine alone to disgrace There\u2019s something quite seditious about the stadium-sized euphoria of the song \u2013 that she can criticise elements of her audience and make them sing along with those criticisms \u2013 as well as the subtle country musicianship that blossoms towards the end, gesturing at the precocious and scrupulously behaved country star that Swift once was and that many expect her to still be. The punchline is great \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m having his baby / No I\u2019m not but you should see your faces\u201d \u2013 but the sentiment about who gets to decide what\u2019s right for her, as a 34-year-old woman who\u2019s been working for 20 years, is even better. Later, on Guilty as Sin?, she details the boredom she seemed to feel in her previous relationship and questions \u201cif long-suffering propriety is what they want from me\u201d. Swift has questioned the contract of likability that female pop stars are expected to uphold with the public before, and has been untangling the concept of the \u201cgood girl\u201d she was raised to be for several years, but has never made quite so plain that she has no intention of living up to it any more. She\u2019s rejecting idealisation As well as trouncing expectations that she should uphold some level of respectability, Swift also reckons with the limits of romantic idealisation, as seen from both sides. She makes very clear that the thought of Healy captivated her while her relationship with Alwyn was foundering \u2013 to the degree that Guilty as Sin? documents her fantasies about Healy, prompting categorically the first allusion to masturbation in her catalogue: \u201cThese fatal fantasies / Giving way to laboured breath / Taking all of me / We\u2019ve already done it in my head.\u201d Once they got together, she sings, they both told friends that they\u2019d die without one another; she swears she can reform his bad habits. But the fantasies turn out to be just that: The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived is a Dear John/All Too Well-level evisceration of how he \u201chung me on your wall / Stabbed me with your push pins / In public showed me off / Then sank in stoned oblivion\u201d, and ultimately ghosted her. The sheen dulls to black: \u201cI\u2019ll say good riddance,\u201d she sings, \u201ccos it wasn\u2019t sexy once it wasn\u2019t forbidden.\u201d It\u2019s her funniest album \u2026 Line for line, TTPD features Swift\u2019s most cutting lyrics. When presumably Healy brings a typewriter to her house on the title track, she sings, \u201cI laughed in your face and said, \u2018You\u2019re not Dylan Thomas / I\u2019m not Patti Smith / This ain\u2019t the Chelsea hotel / We\u2019re modern idiots.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s the \u201chaving his baby\u201d line in But Daddy I Love Him, the vengeful wraith of Who\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me? and in Florida!!! (a duet with Florence Welch), an astute line about a particularly isolating aspect of being a childfree 34-year-old who actually has her shit together: \u201cMy friends all smell like weed or little babies.\u201d (As someone also born in 1989, I find this to be the first Swift album since her teenage records that feels like an authentic reflection of this age: \u201cGrowing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all,\u201d as she sings on But Daddy I Love Him.) Mingling the mordant and the cocksure, I Can Do It With a Broken Heart reveals \u2013 and revels in \u2013 how she duped hundreds of thousands of people into thinking she was having the time of her life on the Eras tour when in reality she was depressed. \u201cI cry a lot but I am so productive / It\u2019s an art,\u201d she sing-songs, lording in her ability to keep up appearances \u2013 you suspect her therapist might have something to say about leaning on work as a coping mechanism. And the very meme-worthy line \u201clights, camera, bitch, smile / Even when you wanna die\u201d makes clear why she wanted back on TikTok. Moreover, there are even gags in the music \u2013 the burbling synths, booming drums and glazed backing vocals of opener Fortnight, featuring a barely there Post Malone, sound rather a lot like the 1975\u2019s signature sound. \u2026 and her most brutal When Swift released Red (Taylor\u2019s Version) three years ago, it came with an expanded 10-minute version of All Too Well that deepened the song\u2019s already considerable evisceration of a past relationship with an imbalanced power dynamic. Swift seems to have brought that kind of digressive, detailed writing to LOML (with the great line \u201ca con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme\u201d) and The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived, which questions the reality of her relationship with (one suspects) Healy, telling him \u201cyou deserve prison\u201d and skewering some textbook fuckboy-ery: \u201cYou said normal girls were \u2018boring\u2019 / But you were gone by the morning.\u201d Swift\u2019s own wounds are as deep as those she inflicts. From the tracklist, fans assumed that TTPD would go deep on her relationship with Alwyn. It\u2019s actually surprisingly sparing, with the majority of the songs seeming to address the Healy situation. So Long, London \u2013 track five, traditionally a spot that Swift reserves for total gut-punches \u2013 is the only song explicitly about their collapse, portraying Swift carrying \u201cthe weight of the rift\u201d, her \u201cwhite-knuckle dying grip holding to your quiet resentment\u201d, a theme she gently expands on a few other songs. Over a simple bed of trembling, heart-in-mouth synths and soft piano, she sings in a tone of crushed devastation, in perhaps her most affecting vocal performance. It\u2019s a refinement, not a reinvention Since 2019\u2019s Lover, it has felt as though Swift has been searching for an adult pop sound to call her own. That album had some gaudy misfires in the lead singles Me! and You Need to Calm Down and tucked some quieter experimentalism in its back half \u2013 songs that seemed to be trying out potential futures for an artist on the cusp of 30 who had already summited higher than anyone had ever summited. Around this time, Swift also seemed to be negotiating a shift from the pop mainstream to a more alternative, songwriterly lane. In the documentary Miss Americana, released in January 2020, she made a scathing comment on the pressure put on female pop stars to reinvent \u201cbut only in a way that we find to be equally comforting but also a challenge for you\u201d. A fortnight later, she attended the NME awards \u2013 an unusually homespun event for a regular Grammys fixture \u2013 and was pictured alongside Robyn, whose cool example felt indicative of how she might like to grow into her career. Later that Covid-struck year, Swift released two surprise lockdown albums, the folksy Folklore and Evermore, made in part with Aaron Dessner of the National and featuring guest spots from their frontman Matt Berninger as well as Bon Iver. It was all very tasteful, a vibe continued by 2022\u2019s Midnights, which seemed to draw from her re-recording project by consolidating previous new dawns into a more mature pop sound tinged by atmospheric vintage synths (though it still contained conspicuous lead-single material in Anti-Hero). Made again with Dessner and regular collaborator Jack Antonoff, The Tortured Poets Department (TTPD) is another refinement, filtering the booming synths of 2014\u2019s 1989 through a muted Midnights-y filter that makes her stories of being gutted by two major romantic disappointments sound authentically bruised and wearied. Dessner\u2019s influence is there in the ticking pianos and pulsing synths that give even the more anthemic moments a homespun feel; Antonoff\u2019s many detractors will have plenty to complain about in the Bleachers-worthy boom. As for newer directions, Florida!!!, Who\u2019s Afraid of Little Old Me and I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can) make a great, subtle virtue of the southern gothic melodrama Swift tried out on Evermore\u2019s shlocky No Body, No Crime; while the only supersized pop moment is I Can Do It With a Broken Heart, which blows dazzling arpeggiated synths worthy of Robyn or the Pet Shop Boys stadium-wards. The whole album seems to pulse with an anxious, human heartbeat. Lana Del Rey\u2019s influence looms large In 2019, Swift singled Del Rey out for praise when she accepted the Billboard woman of the decade award calling her \u201cthe most influential artist in pop\u201d. They collaborated on the Midnights track Snow on the Beach, and when that record won the Grammy for album of the year in February, Swift reiterated her praise: \u201cI think so many female artists would not be where they are and would not have the inspiration they have it if weren\u2019t for the work that she\u2019s done.\u201d (Swift also brought Del Rey to the Super Bowl in February to watch her boyfriend, the Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce.)

Sissay, whose bestselling memoir My Name Is Why was a reflection on his own childhood in care, said the government had \u201ccherrypicked\u201d from the 2022 MacAlister review, despite the report putting forward costed recommendations that would save money in the longer term. \u201cWhy commission an independent review and not act on it? That\u2019s what happened. That review took a year \u2013 it\u2019s the best review of children\u2019s social care, the most thorough one in my lifetime,\u201d Sissay said. \u201cThat review and the fact it\u2019s disappeared within the public conversation is a big deal, this is classic children\u2019s services, which is we know what the solution might be, it\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t got the resources but we\u2019re not going to give the resources, we\u2019re not even going to aim for them \u2013 because it\u2019s not a vote winner. \u201cWe\u2019re ignoring children in need by ignoring children in care, we\u2019re not giving them the attention they deserve, the most vulnerable in our society. It should be the highest point on the agenda of any government.\u201d Among the recommendations rejected by the Department for Education were the proposed level of funding \u2013 ministers committed to \u00a3200m over two years as opposed to \u00a32.6bn over five \u2013 as well as making care experience a protected characteristic and committing to universal standards. Sissay spoke to the Guardian before the publication of a new book, Free Loaves on Fridays, thought to be the largest ever collection of stories from care leavers. He said the book was \u201craising the narrative of young people in care\u201d and showed \u201cthe myriad lives of people who\u2019ve come from the care system\u201d. \u201cWe are everywhere. We are no longer quiet, we are no longer feeling as if we shouldn\u2019t mention children\u2019s homes because it might spoil the party, it might make people feel awkward \u2013 people are ready to hear it and we\u2019re ready to speak it,\u201d he said. While he felt there had never been so much public discourse around children in care, he worried they were too often left out of conversations around child poverty, especially in the run-up to an election and amid scandals such as unregulated private children\u2019s homes that are \u201chappening in front of us\u201d. Referencing the tendency to dismiss criticisms of the care system by asserting that some young people have positive experiences, Sissay said: \u201cWhen you bring somebody into a hospital, if they leave with more broken legs than they went in, you wouldn\u2019t say, \u2018Lots of people get healed at this hospital\u2019, you\u2019d say, \u2018Why are they more sick when they came out than when they went in\u2019. That\u2019s something to be angry about. \u201cThe care system should be so good that middle-class parents are trying to put their children into care because it\u2019s so good and social workers have to have conferences on how to stop them doing it.\u201d One of the stories featured in the new book sheds light on how the care system has deteriorated in recent decades. Its author, Chantelle Billson, was moved into foster care aged three as her parents, who struggled with drug addiction, were unable to care for her. She credits the consistent and loving support from her social worker with giving her the stability she needed to find and settle into a comfortable life with an adoptive family. \u201cIt filled that void of neglect I felt a lot as a child,\u201d she said. Yet her former social worker Laura Bishop* said that had Billson been in care today she would have struggled to give her the same consistent support. \u201cThings were very different 20-25 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I first came in there was probably a lot less paperwork than there is now \u2013 we\u2019re very paperwork driven, which isn\u2019t what social workers want. We were much freer in terms of the stress around process. There\u2019s a lot more scrutiny around social workers, a lot more pressures on us and I think 20-odd years ago there was probably more money.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cEvery child deserves to live in a safe and stable home. We are reforming the entire children\u2019s social care system to help children and families overcome multiple and complex needs at an early stage, so they can stay together and thrive. \u201cCouncils are getting increased spending power of up to \u00a34.5bn next year so they can deliver first-rate services \u2013 including social care. For those leaving care, we are investing \u00a3250m over three years to help them succeed \u2013 providing housing, access to education, employment, and training.\u201d * Name has been changed", "date": "2024-04-19", "section": "Society", "author": "Rachel Hall", "id": 169, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/22b0f0aa08d81c2dfa9a17ec34ca62d329ca6abb/0_415_8256_4954/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018I\u2019m just a lawnmower man, I\u2019m no one special\u2019: Nathan Stafford, the Sydney gardener with a following of millions", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/20/nathan-stafford-nathanslawnsandgardens-interview-tiktok", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.059, "neu": 0.739, "pos": 0.203, "compound": 0.9986}, "body": "On a quiet street in Sydney\u2019s Glebe, Nathan Stafford is standing halfway up a ladder balancing his child\u2019s old shoe, with his phone wedged inside, on the ladder\u2019s top rung. He\u2019s trying to angle his phone to get a good shot of the yard of a public housing unit below. The weeds have run wild and the grass is threatening to reclaim the concrete footpath snaking through. Moments ago the shoe and the phone were atop a yellow bin he\u2019d dragged to the front door of the home to film the resident, Jo Lee, as she answers his loud knock. She\u2019d asked him to come help. \u201cI got a message you need a little hand with your lawn,\u201d Stafford says blithely to Lee. \u201cWhat would you say if I knocked this over for you for free?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she responds. It\u2019s a typically barebones filming operation for a gardener who has curiously amassed a huge international following and, a few weeks ago, scored a meeting with the New South Wales housing minister to discuss the state of social housing. Stafford, in his videos and in person, is shaped in the mould of a knockabout Aussie bloke; he\u2019s self-deprecating, no-fuss and jovial. He tells his millions of followers: \u201cI\u2019m just a lawnmower man, I\u2019m no one special.\u201d So who is this humble lawnmower man, and why has he come to be of such influence? About eight years ago Stafford, who lives in Ryde and has three children, started filming videos of himself gardening while doing paid jobs. At first they only got a couple of clicks but, after four years of regularly posting himself artfully trimming a perfect edge along a lawn or taming gardens for free, his videos started to hit the tens of thousands, then millions of views. Now, he has upwards of 2 million followers on TikTok, 1.7 million on Facebook, and 1.6 million on Instagram. The 44-year-old\u2019s videos, some of which have been watched as many as 125m times, can be oddly beautiful and satisfying in their simplicity. There are the quasi-sensory snippets of him scraping up tufts of grass from pavements. Time-lapses of him tidying up overgrown messes. Nature returned to human-made order. \u201cI think there\u2019s something in our brains that just likes to see a mess cleaned up,\u201d Stafford says. His videos cross over two of some of the most popular genres of social media content: tidying videos and ASMR videos. But a core part of his brand are philanthropic acts for \u201clegends\u201d who are \u201cdoing it tough\u201d. Mainly taming unruly gardens for those who are unable to manage their gardens themselves, nor pay for someone else to do it for them. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Such is the case of Lee in Glebe. Her son has chronic fatigue syndrome and she has a shoulder injury. She has been trying to get the housing department to send someone to help with her garden, to no avail. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to find help these days,\u201d Lee tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for Nathan.\u201d Stafford later films himself giving her money, saying it could go towards paying someone to clean up her lawn next time or for food, \u201cor whatever you\u2019ve got to do\u201d. Videos like these sit within another social media phenomenon of content creators undertaking acts of philanthropy for an audience. Some of these videos have been criticised as fodder for clicks and followers \u2013 a monetisation of kindness. Stafford says neither making money nor collecting more followers is his motivation. \u201cI just want to give back,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve always done jobs for discounts and free for the seniors,\u201d he says. Unpaid work pre-dated his social media fame and his ASMR videos had amassed him more than a million followers before he thought about filming his free jobs. As his followers increased, he noticed a trend in the US where garden content creators would randomly knock on people\u2019s doors and ask if they could clean up their gardens for free. He began to do the same, driving around Sydney, searching for overgrown yards. Sometimes the videos can feel uncomfortable. When he knocks on the door, the person answering sometimes seems confused as to why this upbeat man is at their home, recording them, while he asks them if he can clean their garden for free \u201cand when I finish all you got to do is come out and tell me what you think\u201d. Many are vulnerable, some live in public housing. He says about 95% of people say yes and are thrilled by the result. He posts a video for about half the free jobs he does; either due to the recipient requesting him not to or him deciding it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. Lee doesn\u2019t mind Stafford filming her, she says, because it helps him help others. \u201cI try to make it as positive as possible,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes there can be can be some shame about [having an overgrown garden] but I don\u2019t want to be what this is.\u201d Stafford now splits his time between paid jobs and free services \u2013 the money he gets from his social media content, and a gardening tools brand that sponsors him, now covers his expenses to do the free jobs. In a video from last year he cleans a house up that has no running water and is soon to be demolished. The resident, who is squatting, tells Stafford he can\u2019t access homelessness services because of his dog. In a voiceover on top of footage of himself dislodging weeds, Stafford acknowledges the futility of tidying up a house due for demolition. He also reveals that he has experienced homelessness in his youth. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like \u2026 Hopefully [the man squatting] walks away and thinks people care.\u201d He tells Guardian Australia: \u201cI\u2019ve come from the other side of the fence, so I know what this is all about. I relate to these people, and I know that they\u2019re struggling.\u201d *** Stafford believes his audience finds comfort in seeing a problem, and something being done about it, soundtracked by the buzz of a lawnmower. But he has started to piece together for both his viewers and himself, video by video, a bigger picture. A picture about the state of public housing, and how we support those who rely upon it. He says his audience is starting to ask: \u201cWhat is the government doing about this?\u201d He rarely says anything about his free gardening recipients beyond the fact they\u2019re \u201cdoing it tough\u201d. They have other stories \u2013 about their personal lives and their efforts to get other maintenance work done \u2013 that he doesn\u2019t put on camera, he says, and they leave him sleepless at night. In a video at the start of April, veering from his usual garden clean-up, he cleans a man\u2019s home in a public housing estate littered with mess and bottles. In commentary overlaid on to footage of him sweeping up piles of rubbish from the person\u2019s lounge room, he calls out to the NSW housing minister, Rose Jackson, for a meeting. The video reached the minister and she agreed to meet him. Stafford plans to take her for a walk around the homes of people he has helped at the end of May. Announcing the meeting to his followers, he thanks them for giving him his platform for good. \u201cThis is only because of you legends,\u201d he says. At the end of his job at Lee\u2019s house in Glebe, with the grass freshly cut, and the path visible again, he looks up at the phone propped in the shoe in the ladder.

By laying out in detail the emotional and physical abuse she says she suffered throughout her tennis career at the hands of her father, Dokic unleashed a wave that would shape the next phase of her life. It wasn\u2019t just the outpouring of support that followed the revelations, or the connections forged when others began sharing their experiences with her, it was also the process of writing itself that offered Dokic a new perspective after a lifetime spent focused on one thing and one thing only: tennis. \u201cActually having different passions in my life has been so amazing,\u201d she says, as we walk past Rod Laver Arena, the site of many of her earlier-life triumphs and torments, and along the Yarra River in Melbourne. At mid-morning on a Sunday in late summer, the river is streaked with rowers, and cyclists and walkers stream around us as we stroll leisurely under the plane trees. \u201cI only really discovered that through the journey of writing ... That\u2019s why I\u2019ll say it every single day for the rest of my life: Unbreakable changed my life, and it saved my life. It gave me a voice, I was free.\u201d It\u2019s taken time, but today Dokic no longer only feels like a \u201cvictim and survivor\u201d. In the years between the release of Unbreakable and her new book Fearless, she has been figuring out how to turn the challenges of her past into something positive, something meaningful. \u201cWhat I want people to get from me is that you can go through a lot of adversity and you can go through a lot of negative experiences, and unpleasant ones, and come out the other side,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can still find a way through that, you can still thrive.\u201d Dokic pauses, then taps me on the arm to emphasise her next point. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I stand for today,\u201d she says, still nudging me. \u201cI wanted to try to not just come out the other side, but maybe [ask] how can I use it for something good?\u201d Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning She has found her answer in writing books, staying involved in tennis through commentating, but also on the speaking circuit. In schools, at sports clubs, in the corporate world and for charity events, Dokic tells her story again and again. Far from your standard motivational talk preaching the grit and persistence of a former athlete, Dokic\u2019s willingness to talk openly about her darker private experiences encourages a deeper type of reflection. It can result in her carrying a heavy burden. She is regularly approached by other survivors of abuse who share their trauma with her. \u201cI take a lot of that on and it\u2019s daily \u2013 some people might say \u2013 \u2018work\u2019, but I don\u2019t look at it as that,\u201d she says. Dokic credits her own therapy with enabling her to support others: \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about how to deal with situations \u2026 how our brain functions and our emotions.\u201d Social media has enabled her to created her own kind of \u201cfamily\u201d, she says. Dokic posts regularly on Instagram, sharing daily snippets from her life and engaging with her followers. It does come with trolling, an act which she \u201cdoesn\u2019t get\u201d, but she says the one or two abusive comments in every thousand is worth it. \u201cI wanted to show people that you can have those tough times, but you\u2019re not alone,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I often felt alone, because I lived in that era when we didn\u2019t talk about domestic violence, and other things.\u201d Talking about her experience, she says, \u201chas actually saved my life at times and I think it\u2019s helped a lot of other people as well.\u201d This era of her life and career, the talks and all the rest, to Dokic is a vocation. \u201cI do hear horrific stories, and I do connect with people. I feel like it\u2019s my calling.\u201d As we walk towards the landscaped park of Birrarung Marr on the edge of Melbourne\u2019s CBD, Dokic speaks swiftly, her words flowing with the urgency and clarity of someone whose voice was silenced for so long, embracing the freedom she has found. Her purpose may be clearer now, but it took time to untangle after a tumultuous playing career cut short by injuries and mental health struggles. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to reinvent yourself or start something new after you\u2019ve been an athlete, because that\u2019s the only thing you\u2019ve ever known your whole life,\u201d Dokic says. After retiring in 2014, and feeling as if she had never reached her full potential as a player, Dokic was adrift. \u201cI was a woman with nothing to aspire to, no goals and dreams left. \u201cAnd to now be doing this \u2013 if you told me that 10 years ago, I would have told you that you are literally crazy,\u201d Dokic says, appearing both earnest and awed. \u201cI have a lot of joy in my life now, I\u2019m thriving.\u201d We are suddenly interrupted as someone in a purple inflatable unicorn suit zips past us on a scooter. Bemused, we turn back to Rod Laver Arena again, where Dokic not long ago spent 15 days commentating the Australian Open. \u201cIt\u2019s just become really, really special,\u201d she says. Rod Laver remains her favourite court, the Australian Open her favourite grand slam. The burgeoning of her post-playing career is part of the reason Melbourne means so much to Dokic. After living through the period of the breakdown of the former Yugoslavia, 11-year-old Dokic and her family emigrated to Sydney in 1994. By then she had already been playing seriously for five years and was a national champion in Yugoslavia. Much of the second half of her tennis career \u2013 when she was no longer coached by her father \u2013 was spent playing and training in Melbourne. The city has been her home for a long time, and despite being the setting for some of the hardest moments of her career (like the hostility she faced after her father forced her to switch to playing for Yugoslavia), the leafy gardens and paths around the Melbourne Park tennis centre now also represent opportunity and growth. Melbourne is where Dokic realised there was a whole other chapter of her career to come, still within tennis\u2019s orbit, but one which she could define for herself. \u201cI had role models when I was playing, in Steffi Graf and Monica Seles, they were my heroes,\u201d Dokic says. But there were no heroes for life after sport, life after abuse. There was no one she could look at and say, \u201cthey\u2019ve gone through it \u2026 you will be OK\u201d. \u201cIf I can be that for one person, I\u2019m the happiest person in the world.\u201d Because Dokic is, after all this, OK. \u2022 In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14 and the national family violence counselling service on 1800 737 732.

Neuroscience can tell us a great deal about the way our brains function but consciousness itself \u2013 our sense of identity and creativity, our personality and proclivity, our very notion of self \u2013 is to some extent utterly mysterious. And that\u2019s before we consider the complications that come from mental illness. How can we calm, control and regulate what we barely understand? Kendall Feaver\u2019s award-winning debut play, The Almighty Sometimes, doesn\u2019t shy away from the wondrous and frightening unknowability of the mind, even as it explores the fraught and complex issues around mental health diagnosis and treatment. Its central character is a young woman, Anna (Max McKenna), who has a serious mental illness for which she has been taking medication from the age of 11. She\u2019s now an adult, which means everything is changing. Mum Renee (Nadine Garner) is incredibly supportive, perhaps overly so. New boyfriend Oliver (Karl Richmond) is sanguine and understanding, at least initially. Anna\u2019s longtime psychiatrist Vivienne (Louisa Mignone) is wary. As a paediatric doctor, she\u2019s preparing the way for Anna\u2019s transition to another physician. From the very beginning, the work seethes with a barely placated menace, a tension the playwright keeps palpable but unspoken. Anna seems well, but is she really? The play\u2019s inciting incident is Anna\u2019s discovery of some stories she wrote as a child. They\u2019re really good, full of imagination and creativity; proof, in Anna\u2019s mind, of a latent talent that\u2019s been suppressed by the medication her mother and psychiatrist have been administering for years. What if her real self has also been suppressed? Shouldn\u2019t she discover who she is without these pills? Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning It is to Feaver\u2019s credit that she takes what is ostensibly the problem play \u2013 the kind of drama that occupied Ibsen, elucidating a social issue in a naturalistic setting \u2013 and makes it searingly contemporary, imbuing it with intellectual heft and emotional complexity. The playwright has a powerful capacity for empathy, so that each character\u2019s moral and psychological viewpoint is sketched with a kind of dignified conviction. In a way, everyone on stage is right; the conflict comes from the intractability of the problem, not the care or compassion of the people caught up in it. We are buffeted not by personalities but by the immovable fact of mental illness, its tendency to suck all energy into itself. McKenna is superb in the trickiest role on stage: they have to balance a highly infectious enthusiasm with an ominous and eventually ratcheting mania, both driven and tormented. Anna is hardly endearing, her crackling intellect so often weaponised to inflict harm on those who love and care for her most. McKenna never retreats from the character\u2019s abrasiveness \u2013 the playwright deftly articulates the difference between Anna\u2019s pathology and her flawed personality \u2013 but they also allow us to see the grit and courage underneath, the profound grappling with the self. Garner is also magnificent as the frayed but fearless Renee. She conveys an unwavering devotion to, and bone-wearying frustration with, her vulnerable daughter; the years of accumulated slights and triumphs, the serious progress followed seemingly inevitably by the crushing relapses, are all written on her body. It\u2019s a powerful portrait of the carer as warrior, reaching for respite. Richmond and Mignone are strong in support, each given potent monologues that state their cases with penetrating force. Director Hannah Goodwin keeps the small ensemble tightly calibrated in a production that never lags for a moment. Jacob Battista\u2019s ingenious set \u2013 a series of gunmetal grey interlocking shapes that spin on a central axis \u2013 is both highly functional and emotionally impactful. It suggests anodyne domestic and medical spaces, frosty and soulless, but it transforms, with the help of Amelia Lever-Davidson\u2019s excellent lighting, into something sinister and overwhelming. Kelly Ryall\u2019s composition is deeply affecting too, pushing into the nightmarish. It could easily feel exploitative and tacky, an indulgence in \u201cmadness tropes\u201d you see in horror cinema, but it\u2019s judiciously employed and highly effective. Feaver\u2019s excellent play has a probing, clear-eyed intelligence, coupled with a keen empathic sensibility. It acknowledges both the nobility of the struggle for those living with mental illness, and the care and attention of those who seek to help. The key question \u2013 whether creativity is compromised by mental health treatments, and whether this compromise is justified \u2013 is left unanswered, not as an evasion but as a recognition of its complexity.

She shot to fame in 2014, when she featured on two UK No 1 hits, Clean Bandit\u2019s Rather Be, for which she won a Grammy, and My Love by Route 94. She has since released two No 1 albums, and became the first British female solo artist to have seven No 1 singles, including the omnipresent Hold My Hand. She releases Jess, her first album in six years, on 26 April. I was three and in my house in Muswell Hill when this photograph was taken. I was an opinionated child, so I would have picked this outfit myself, including the shorts. It looks like I\u2019m posing mid-spin; I\u2019d always be singing and dancing around the place. I loved attention and was a real loudmouth. Still am. Mum would be like: \u201cJess! Would you shut the fuck up?\u201d I was the youngest of a fun, wild, big family. Cheeky and annoying and always winding my sister up. There was no telling me what to do. I knew from a young age that I was a performer. I expressed myself all the time, and I did it without self-consciousness \u2013 anything was possible. I was just free. But as I got older, I went into myself and retracted from performing. I loved school for social reasons, and always tried my best, but while some people are born with academic gifts, I had to work extra hard. I wasn\u2019t diagnosed back then, but I had dyslexia, and struggled more than other kids. I got by, I had a great time, teachers loved me, but they also hated me for being chatty. I was always getting shouted at: \u201cJess! Stop talking!\u201d My school had an incredible music department, but they only supported the kids that they wanted to support. It was a cliquey environment, and unfortunately I didn\u2019t get a look in. When I was nine I even put together a performance to show the other students, but the teachers didn\u2019t want to do it. I withdrew completely. It kicked my confidence and I felt uninspired by music, which was sad as I really could sing. There\u2019s a rumour out there that I applied for The X Factor in my teens, but that\u2019s not what happened. A producer wanted to meet me when I was 15. All my friends thought I should do it, they thought I\u2019d win. So I entertained the conversation, but ultimately thought: \u201cHell-freaking-no do I want to be part of that.\u201d Growing up, the show was huge, and it helped lots of people, but I wanted to do it my own way, and even back then I had that determination to say no. That sums me up as a person. I always want to strive to do what fits and feels right in my gut. Once I left school, I didn\u2019t want to go to university to waste thousands of pounds and get into debt. I applied for a job as an intern assisting music managers. During that time, I came across an artist who taught me everything I needed to know about how not to do it. They had been given a huge opportunity to live their dream, and were taking advantage of it. All they cared about was fame and girls. I thought: \u201cThese people are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on your career and you\u2019re just wasting it. I would do anything to be in your position.\u201d Witnessing such a lack of ambition made me realise how much I wanted to do it differently. I was 21, working three jobs and doing an artist development course when I met Jin Jin, who I went on to write a lot of my songs with. That relationship spurred everything on. At the start I didn\u2019t know exactly what art I wanted to make, or who I was, but I met with Max Lousada at Atlantic Records, who said: \u201cI love what you are and I love your songs.\u201d We chatted for six hours. I had other labels wanting to meet too, but I knew the game. I said to my manager: \u201cOK, I\u2019ll sign if he gives me what I want, and does what I want to do. I don\u2019t want to be manipulated, or get a big advance that I\u2019ll have to pay off.\u201d He got it \u2013 and I signed to Atlantic. When one of my A&amp;Rs gave me Rather Be from Clean Bandit, I initially said no. It wasn\u2019t that I hated it, it\u2019s just it didn\u2019t feel natural to sing someone else\u2019s song. I said no twice, then the label told me I should give it another try. A good vocal is all about sentiment and purpose, so I sang it with conviction and made that song my own. Then my career took off. From when I was young, my family would always wind me up by claiming that I wanted to be famous. I would say: \u201cNo! I just want to sing.\u201d When fame happened, my life changed completely. I was struggling with everyone knowing who I was. I\u2019ll never forget having a meltdown at my mum\u2019s and her saying: \u201cJess, you didn\u2019t lie! You didn\u2019t want to be famous.\u201d At the same time, this job is the most beautiful thing. I worked so freaking hard to get to perform for a living \u2013 none of it was luck. I love that I get to sing in front of thousands of people. Fame is complex. I love what it\u2019s given me, but I hate it too. I\u2019ve had to overcome a lot of challenges in the last 10 years. In 2015, I ended up in hospital and having an operation on my voice because I\u2019d worked it too hard, which was terrifying. Then I got to 2019 and finished a tour. Covid hit and I was so grateful to have a reason to do nothing \u2013 to cook and be a human. I didn\u2019t want to see a microphone. Then my world got turned upside down. I had the tragic loss of a friend. And then I had to deal with the fallout from the podcast [Glynne received death threats online after using a transphobic slur on Mo Gilligan\u2019s podcast, and has since apologised]. I made a mistake, and that\u2019s how people learn, but the lack of support I received pushed me into such a dark hole. The industry loves you on the way up, but not on the way down. At the time, I thought: just take it all away from me. I\u2019d rather just live away from the spotlight. The last few years have been hard, and I hate a lot of the things that have happened. But it\u2019s been positive too. I found an incredible therapist and I\u2019ve amicably parted ways with my label. I\u2019ve had so many hit records and so much success \u2013 so when I was still faced with guys at the top trying to dictate where I should go next, I realised I should put my happiness and creativity first. I didn\u2019t want to abide by the rules and play everyone\u2019s game. At the end of the day, that\u2019s not how icons and greats are made. Now I feel like I\u2019m in the strongest place I\u2019ve ever been mentally, physically and artistically. I\u2019m not giving up. The defiant one is still going. This is a perfect image to represent all of that. I love that I\u2019ve got a fierce face and a strong stance. I\u2019m not smiling. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m saying: \u201cI\u2019m here, and I\u2019m not going to be messed with.\u201d \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

It\u2019s no genre bolt from the blue like Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s recent country album; it delivers not just what Tayloristas have been speculating about furiously for months, but more: a surprise second album, The Tortured Poets Department: the Anthology, dropped at 2am the night after the first album\u2019s release. When the LP\u2019s title was announced in February, and the track listing in March, the question was never if, but merely how hard, Swift\u2019s most recent exes \u2013 specifically, British actor Joe Alwyn, but also Matt Healy from the 1975 \u2013 were going to be hung out to dry. As \u201cWilliam Bowery\u201d, Alwyn had songwriter credits on three Swift albums \u2013 Folklore (2020), Evermore (2020) and Midnights (2022) \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty safe to assume he is receiving a great many of the demerits here as Swift gnashes, accuses, mourns, self-flagellates, likens her time with him to a prison (Fresh Out the Slammer) and longs to be taken away in a spaceship (Down Bad) and calls for an exorcist (the sombre bonus piano ballad, how did it end?). Speculating is, of course, all part of the package; a Swiftie-an safe space, you might call it. Her first song widely understood to be about Alwyn was London Boy (on Lover, 2019). One track here is called, pointedly, So Long, London; it doesn\u2019t take an ultra stan to read it as Swift\u2019s Brexit. It only gets messier from there on in. Healy is likely the subject of the Smallest Man Alive, probably the album\u2019s sickest burn, and perhaps handful of other caustic putdowns. According to some, the album\u2019s title reportedly comes from a WhatsApp group Alwyn was part of with fellow actors Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott \u2013 a reference, apparently, to characters Alwyn and Mescal have played in Sally Rooney adaptations (Scott had a role in Rooney director Lenny Abrahamson\u2019s film Normal People Confessions). The album\u2019s release date, 19 April, also marks the start of the American Revolution, when the US split from the UK. Swift is obviously wise enough to pillory herself throughout as well \u2013 the billionaire lyric writer is, after all, the actual tortured poet in this relationship \u2013 and to dismantle literary expectations. \u201cYou\u2019re not Dylan Thomas, I\u2019m not Patti Smith, this ain\u2019t the Chelsea hotel,\u201d she tells an unspecified man who has left a typewriter at her apartment on the title track. The physical album comes bookended by two poems \u2013 or, perhaps, lyrics without music. One is by Stevie Nicks, the patron saint of confessional sirens, and one is a self-justifying text by Swift that ends \u201call\u2019s fair in love and poetry\u201d \u2013 with poetry pointedly standing in for war. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst men that I write best,\u201d she zings, by way of scant consolation. It\u2019s worth noting that Swift is now in a new relationship, with American football player Travis Kelce, a pairing that may be the meat of So High School from The Anthology, a track that is almost indie rock. Not everything here is a roman \u00e0 clef. A few songs that may read like allegorical short stories \u2013 But Daddy I Love Him is a tremendous, Springsteen-like mini-epic set in a stultifying small town \u2013 still contain autobiographical signals. \u201cI don\u2019t cater to all these vipers dressed in empaths\u2019 clothing,\u201d Swift seethes. She is responding perhaps, to fans\u2019 parasocial concerns about her choice of squire \u2013 the kind that surrounded her tryst with Healy. After a pair of lockdown albums \u2013 Folklore, Evermore \u2013 made with producer Aaron Dessner in which Swift\u2019s music became more low-key and semi-fictional, and the more electronic-hued Midnights, made with Jack Antonoff, which also retained a pensive mien, Tortured Poets Department finds Swift back on brand in various ways: nailing love to the wall and watching the ooze trickle and dry, often doing so in a more emphatic, rather than a gauzy manner. Swift isn\u2019t quite shouting at the end of songs as she did some years ago, but her definiteness, her strong outlines, are back. Antonoff is the major collaborator; Dessner\u2019s credits on songs such as So Long, London come as a surprise. The sentiments \u201cfuck it\u201d and \u201cfuck \u2019em\u201d recur. On Reputation (2017), Swift revelled in loose-cannon mode. Perhaps the most outstanding track here is the loudest of all. Florida!!! \u2013 which deserves its three exclamation marks, rendered aurally as huge drums \u2013 finds Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine duetting with Swift in a high-stakes tune about going awol in the party state, escaping their mistakes \u2013 or perhaps throwing exes into a swamp. Not everything here is quite as lively. The Anthology songs are sadder and quieter. At 17 tracks, not counting bonuses, this department feels a mite overstaffed; at twice the length, that goes double. As with many artists, it\u2019s often tricky to date songs exactly. Some of this heartbreak seems to cast back further than the six years of Swift\u2019s tenure with Alwyn, describing more youthful situations. The piano-led Loml (\u201clove of my life\u201d) appears to be about the one that got away (he\u2019s \u201cthe loss of my life\u201d). By the end, some might hanker for a song about something other than romantic discontent. Even Swift knows we have been here before. \u201cI know I\u2019m just repeating myself,\u201d she croons on My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys, a rueful allegory about a doll, toyed with and broken. Squint, and it\u2019s a standout song that got away from the Barbie soundtrack. Only a handful of songs break from heartbreak. A tune from The Anthology styled \u201cthanK you aIMee\u201d spells out \u201cKim\u201d, but Swift\u2019s words technically frame a teenage tormentor, rather than more recent hostilities with the (then) Kardashian-Wests. Cassandra, another bonus outing, deals with the difference between truth and public assumptions. Ultimately, this may be Swift\u2019s most Swiftian album: the unhappiness profound, the details generous, the lessons absorbed. We reward Taylor Swift \u2013 one of the giants of popular song \u2013 handsomely to conduct postmortems on her affairs and extract value: vengeance and wisdom, dopamine hits and succour. The Alchemy is a song about, yes, an old love, but Swift makes gold out of processing her romantic travails.

It\u2019s an incredible stadium, beautiful from the outside and the inside. It felt so warm and inviting and easy to navigate, and you can see so much sky \u2013 it doesn\u2019t feel claustrophobic like some other stadiums. I love baseball, it\u2019s my favourite sport now.

It\u2019s the best sporting experience I\u2019ve ever had. 2. Music venue Pappy and Harriet\u2019s Pioneertown Palace, California Pioneertown was built in the 1940s as a shooting location for westerns. We played there last month at an amazing music venue called Pappy and Harriet\u2019s to about 250 people who had all travelled hours to get there because it\u2019s smack-bang in the middle of the desert. The vibes were absolutely immaculate. Everyone was invested in American country and western culture but loving the campness of being in this make-believe village. Lucinda Williams was there the week before and Paul McCartney has played a number of times. It\u2019s the best place in the world and people are obsessed with it. 3. Restaurant Chez Janou, Paris I\u2019ve eaten there every time I\u2019ve gone to Paris. It\u2019s just the most insane place.

It\u2019s bustling and gorgeous and the people who work there have big personalities. The food is amazing too: one of my favourite dishes is tuna steak on a bed of braised fennel. For dessert, the chocolate mousse is basically unlimited and served from a massive bowl. Ten out of 10. 4. Novel Liarmouth by John Waters This is a wonderful book. I\u2019m a huge John Waters fan \u2013 he is the most singular artist of our time. I don\u2019t know anyone who does anything even close to what he does. This is the first book he\u2019s written and it\u2019s not possible to summarise. The only thing I can say is that the protagonist is a woman who lies compulsively and her lies get her into a lot of trouble. And there\u2019s a talking penis. It\u2019s a masterpiece. You can almost hear him laughing to himself as he\u2019s writing it, because some of the things are so fucking stupid, and yet it\u2019s beautiful and joyous. 5. YouTube video Leonard Cohen at Austin City Limits in 1988 Leonard Cohen has taken over my life recently. I didn\u2019t listen to a single note of his music until about a year and a half ago. One day I was Googling him and the first thing I landed on was First We Take Manhattan, and I was just like, this is the best song that\u2019s ever been made \u2013 a sexy, funny, electropop banger about the nature of terrorism. I was hooked. A couple of weeks ago I found this live performance and I\u2019ve watched it probably 20 times. It\u2019s the best lyric-writing: dense and literary but also fun and accessible. 6. Pub Brady\u2019s, Dunboyne, County Meath, Ireland Brady\u2019s is the centre of the universe as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s been a factor in my life since I was a child, eating Taytos and drinking Fanta in the corner. It\u2019s a traditional long-hall Irish pub in the centre of the village, with framed GAA [Gaelic Athletic Association] posters everywhere. There are four sections connected by a long bar. The first is where the music sessions usually are. I sit at the back with my family where it\u2019s a bit more craic. I\u2019ve never had a better pint of Guinness anywhere else.

You weren\u2019t allowed to leave unless it was to see, like, your significant other. We couldn\u2019t wait anymore.

I don\u2019t have a least favourite bird. But my favourite bird is a pigeon; they\u2019re so under-appreciated. Do you know the history of them? Pigeons were initially bred to be pets and companion birds \u2013 like mankind\u2019s best friend. And then we just abandoned them, and now they loiter on the street. Have you seen a pigeon\u2019s nest? They\u2019re pathetic. They don\u2019t know how to make nests because they\u2019re domesticated animals. It\u2019s actually really sad. People hate them but it\u2019s our fault \u2013 we did this to them. What are you secretly really good at? I can immediately tell by someone\u2019s face if they\u2019re Irish, Australian or American. I\u2019ll be walking down the street and be like, \u201cThat guy\u2019s Irish.\u201d Then they speak and they\u2019ll be Irish. I\u2019m Irish and my dad\u2019s Irish so maybe it\u2019s Irish telepathic communication. Can you describe your high school experience in three words? Really not good. If you had to go back to high school, what is one thing you would do differently? I was home schooled from year 8 because of how shit my high school experience was. I was diagnosed as autistic and then my parents were told to pull me out of school. They were like: she can\u2019t survive, this education system is not built for her, you\u2019ll lose her if you keep her there. So I wish that I could go back and be able to sit down with my teachers and say: this is who I am. And you need to be able to look after me. You need to be able to look after all the people that have different minds, because it\u2019s not going to be just me. There\u2019s going to be multiple kids in a class that are struggling quietly, you\u2019re not going to know about it because they\u2019re too scared to tell you. I wish I had the knowledge that I have now to be able to go back and change what happened.

The \u201chandwritten\u201d note came with a limited number of copies of the musician\u2019s latest album, The Tortured Poets Department, which was released on Friday. Spotify announced that Swift had made history as the most-streamed artist in a single day, with the most streamed album and track in a single day. The album is the first in Spotify history to have more than 300m streams in one day. While the album itself is not an official Record Store Day (RSD) release, the note celebrated the event, which promotes independent retailers. \u201cHappy Record Store Day!!\u201d it reads. \u201cThank you, from the bottom of my heart, for welcoming The Tortured Poets Department into your vinyl collection and your life. \u201cIt\u2019s my goal to create a memento you\u2019ll want to keep forever, and I hope you\u2019ll feel that with every turn of the page of the lyric book, every secret thought poured into this work. It\u2019s an honour to be able to trust you with my feelings. Love, Taylor.\u201d Paddy Lacy Scott, from Rough Trade in Soho, London, said that several hundred more copies of Swift\u2019s album had to be ordered to keep up with the expected demand. In total, thousands more records across different genres had to be ordered, with pop music, especially by artists popular with younger generations, proving a big hit. Scott said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to order more Gen Z favourite pop music \u2026 so far they\u2019re all selling well.\u201d Record Store Day was started in 2007, with more than 270 venues across the UK now taking part. Organisers predicted this year\u2019s event would give these shops a boost of \u00a39.7m. Artists such as Olivia Rodrigo, Laufey, and Noah Kahan all released official RSD-exclusive products, only available to buy on the day in shops. Rough Trade store manager William Thomas Yates said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that vinyl is this popular among younger music fans.\u201d The vinyl resurgence, which has seen a new generation of music lovers turning to the classic format, has pushed sales to their highest annual level since 1990. British Phonographic Industry (BPI) figures show that vinyl sales grew for the 16th consecutive year in 2023 \u2013 with much of this credited to younger fans. \u201cI think [physical music] is cooler because I can show my friends my collection,\u201d said Hannah Tascione, 19, browsing at Rough Trade. \u201cThe act of putting the vinyl on your player is more of a moment than just pressing play on Spotify.\u201d Tascione, who was shopping with her friend Callie Bartkin, 18, was purchasing a RDS special by indie-pop band the 1975. Bartkin added: \u201cOn Spotify whenever I shuffle it\u2019ll play songs from varying artists, but when I listen to a vinyl I listen to the whole entire collection from that artist.\u201d In addition to buying vinyl, London-based Swifties flocked to The Black Dog pub in Vauxhall, south London, after it appeared to be name-checked in The Tortured Poets Department on a track of the same name. Swift sings: \u201cAnd so I watch as you walk into some bar called The Black Dog.\u201d The album features mentions of a number of London locations, from Hampstead Heath to Shoreditch.

Pawns fly through the air like exploded balcony segments, rooks plink and plonk off the floor and embed themselves deep within the recesses of our home. My five-year-old son stands above the debris, glowering like Godzilla. He has upended the board again following a defeat to his persistent aggressor. Me. Chess pieces travel fast, so everything else you might wish to offer at this juncture \u2013 remonstration, comfort, a stern word, or a hug \u2013 must be put on hold while you chase down the disjecta membra in the tiny window of time in which they continue to live in this dimension. For those few seconds they will be visible, found rotating slowly under tables and couches, still energised by the explosion that\u2019s just rent them from their grid. After that they\u2019ll become mere memories, popping back into existence one by one over the next few weeks, in plant pots, slippers and, basically, anywhere you\u2019re looking for something else. The side benefit of this chore is it allows him to cool down as we return the pieces to their right place, and speak about what\u2019s just happened. Michael Jordan once said, \u2018Show me a good loser and I\u2019ll show you a loser.\u2019 Well, he\u2019d have loved my son, one of the worst losers in all of Christendom. He \u2013 my son, not Michael Jordan \u2013 is still teaching me chess and, I should stress, beating me most of the time. Having never played chess before about six weeks ago, I suddenly find myself wanting to play constantly, and we have dozens of games each week. I win about one game in three, and 50% of those occasions results in us picking up the pieces afterwards. He gets it from his mother, who has never given up in any game or argument since I\u2019ve known her. If I lose at, say, tenpin bowling, the pain dissolves from my brain like vapour within milliseconds of defeat. My wife, on the other hand, will immediately begin drafting a strongly worded email titled \u2018Justice?!?\u2019 to Sheikh Talal Mohammed Al-Sabah, president of the International Bowling Federation. I generally find if I\u2019m good at something, I don\u2019t mind losing, because I enjoy the sport of it. If I\u2019m not good at something, I simply couldn\u2019t care less. There may be a harrowing psychological process at play inside my brain. Some infinite capacity for emotional repression, perhaps, or a psychopathic propensity for wiping failure from my mind. It\u2019s served me well through the many disappointments of my life, and I now face having to counsel my son through his own. I say nothing, choosing instead the path of example. We reset the board. His face is pursed and sour. I tell myself maybe I\u2019ll go easy on him, but then I see a killer route to his queen. I can\u2019t be letting him away with that, I think. He needs to learn. Before I\u2019ve even withdrawn my hand, his rook has swooped for my undefended king, ending the game. He laughs. I feel a hotness in my throat and draw a blank as I think who I could send an email to. His eyes fill with glee, coaxing me to join him on the dark side. All equanimity is lost.

The charity was founded in December 2015 by Selina Hales, a Glasgow native who wanted to welcome displaced people in the city after seeing news coverage of Syrians escaping war and persecution and crossing into Europe. Glasgow has the largest refugee population in the UK outside London. The scale and reach of charities such as Refuweegee have rapidly grown over the last few years, in part due to the rising numbers of asylum seekers but also because of the generosity and involvement of the local community. The charity has expanded to a network of more than 200 volunteers across Glasgow. Refuweege merchandise with the charity\u2019s slogan: \u2018We\u2019re all fae somewhere.\u2019 Among other services, Refuweegee provides welcome packs to people newly arrived in the city. It has supplied more than 10,000 packs, which include essentials for Glasgow such as umbrellas and gloves as well as Scottish treats such as Irn-Bru and Tunnock\u2019s tea cakes. It also makes up little backpacks for children that include books, games and toys. Welcome packs with hand-written letters from the local community The item that makes them unique is a hand-written letter from a local Glaswegian welcoming them. It is difficult to imagine yourself alone on foreign soil without speaking the native language. The letter is a touching and connecting gesture for people in a new and often distant location. It offers a marked contrast to the anonymous protocols of the asylum system. The charity also prepares food parcels for families and people living in hotel accommodation where no kitchen facilities are available. Food being prepared for last year\u2019s Christmas party One way in which they offer essentials such as toiletries and clothing is by having a \u201cfree shop\u201d, a large space filled with donations from local people and companies. Refugees can book a slot to browse the shop and take what they want. Volunteers replenish the stock between appointments, and any gaps in supplies such as toothpaste, deodorants or nappies are often very quickly replenished by the public when a shout-out is put on to their social media accounts. Lily replenishes the toiletries at the free shop As someone with young children myself, the little packets with toys and games are a poignant way of imagining the hardship of being forcibly displaced. I have three children who have so many toys and games at home, and yet it can still feel hard to keep them entertained and content. I am reminded of the privileges of my life, the privileges that should be rights for everyone. The freedom to be comfortable, safe and fed. And to play. Olha Reshetova holds a pysanky workshop. Pysanky is a Ukrainian tradition of egg decoration at Easter The individual stories that come from the work are remarkable. It has been difficult to capture this photographically because of respect for the privacy of individuals, but hopefully I can can convey something of the care and joy that is given to people whose lives are hard to imagine; people who are trying to live on \u00a38 a week when I have just spent that amount on parking. There are people who have saved their allowance for weeks just to be able to afford the train fare to visit Refuweegee from as far away as Aberdeen. Stephan and Abdul enjoy the playroom at Refuweegee Party dresses donated by the local community I talk to the volunteers at the free shop as they prepare for the next booked slot of 15 people. \u201cOne young schoolboy had left his bag on the bus. We were able to put a new schoolbag together with a pencil case. What seems small to us makes a big difference,\u201d says Ellie as she searches for a winter coat that will fit a five-year-old. One family visiting the shop reveals that their little girl is soon to turn two. The staff are able to turn to a rail of party dresses and pick out one for her, complete with hair band and shoes. A mother checks to see if a dress fits her daughter and, right, Brogan entertains children while their parents browse the free shop Refuweegee can provide art therapy for traumatised children and English classes for their parents. They are able to do this because local communities make it possible with their donations and their understanding of need. It is also a space for people to meet, socialise and rest. Hales told the Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee last year that \u201cspace\u201d had become one of the most essential things that Refuweegee provides, because people can be isolated in single hotel rooms for long periods. People take part in the conversation club designed to help people learn and practice English The space they have created here feels welcoming, and I can imagine the relief that it provides for those who don\u2019t have a place like this elsewhere in their lives. Refuweegee is a testament to the city\u2019s slogan: \u201cPeople make Glasgow.\u201d It makes me more optimistic witnessing the efforts of Refuweegee and the local community to support people who need and deserve it.

It has a deep, savoury hit, and using a little can go a long way. One of the things I\u2019ve done for years, and encourage people to try, is make my own chorizo sausage. It\u2019s super easy and quite rewarding. But it all starts with some good free-range, organic minced pork, preferably belly or shoulder, and some really good paprika. I add three types: a really good smoked paprika, a sweet paprika, and a hot paprika. Then I mix in fennel seeds, garlic, a little bit of red wine and salt, then give it a really good tumble. If you add enough salt, say 2% (so, for 1kg of mix, add 20g salt), it will actually preserve the mixture, and you can pop it in the fridge, and it will last for a week to 10 days. Or you can freeze batches of it, too. Then you can use that mix in all sorts of different recipes. What I really love doing is wrapping it around eggs to make chorizo scotch eggs. It\u2019s absolutely delicious, and the smoky flavour with the eggs is always a winner. You can use it in pasta sauces, you can make wonderful smoky chorizo meatballs, you can make sausage rolls with the mix. I use it when I saute or roast potatoes. I boil potatoes in salted water, rough them up, then they go into a tray of hot oil and I scatter over a good couple of teaspoons of smoked paprika, cracked coriander seed, chopped rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, salt, pepper, and roast until everything\u2019s lovely and crunchy. It\u2019s a great addition to fish soups and stews, not necessarily for that smoky hit, but for umami depth. It\u2019s weird because it\u2019s not a fermented spice as such, and you wouldn\u2019t consider it necessary to have that umami flavour. I think that the smoking process of the peppers just gives it a very unusual, deep savoury note. When I\u2019m making fish soups, I sweat down celery, onions, garlic and fennel, and I add the smoked paprika, lemon zest, bay, some chopped tomatoes, then fish stock, and that gets simmered up. And then the fish goes in at the end. You can make your own smoked paprika at home just using a good sweet paprika. If you\u2019ve got the wherewithal to set up a little cold smoker \u2013 and it\u2019s not difficult, you can buy little cold smoker sets. If you lay a tray of sweet paprika out, you can cold smoke it and make wonderful smoked paprika that you can then jar up and have on the shelf ready to use. It\u2019s wonderful with all sorts of vegetables. One of my favourite salads is roast cauliflower and smoked paprika. You break the cauliflower into florets, tumble it out over a roasting tray, add olive oil, lots of smoked paprika, salt and pepper, red onions, then roast that and tumble it with sliced preserved lemon, coriander seed, fresh coriander and a yoghurt dressing. Its smoky flavours work fantastically with the sweetness of carrots. It\u2019s very good with chicken and steaks. I finish taramasalata with smoked paprika for a double-smoked hit \u2013 and it looks cool. And however you like your eggs \u2013 scrambled, omelette, frittata \u2013 a little sprinkling of smoked paprika is probably going to improve them. Gill Meller is a chef and food writer.

And there is Linda, Jack\u2019s 70-year-old mother, a longtime devotee of a range of lifestyle supplements \u2013 sold through a multi-level marketing scheme \u2013 who is intent on revitalising her own position within its pyramid of sellers by becoming a wellness influencer on social media. Jack is accustomed to watching his mother\u2019s videos and livestreams, mostly for the wicked sense of schadenfreude that they bring him \u2013 but this is the limit of their relationship. The pair have not spoken since Jack\u2019s transition, now over a decade ago, although the rift between was much longer in the making. Linda takes pride in, even insists on, her good health and capacity \u2013 she is, she claims, \u201croutinely mistaken for a 65-year-old\u201d \u2013 and considers this evidence of the efficacy of the supplements she spruiks. But when she breaks her hip in a sudden fall, Jack and his sister Alice are forced to fly to her Noosa home to help out while she recovers, and it quickly becomes clear that all is not as it seems. Not with Linda, nor with her business, and definitely not with her husband Peter, whose vague forgetfulness is veering into a steep decline. Jack and Linda\u2019s alternating voices, working in counterpoint, are what give Price\u2019s novel much of its madcap energy. Both characters are compelling, in their very different ways, and both are, to differing degrees, unreliable as narrators \u2013 intently focused on their own travails, and constrained by their firm worldviews. Linda is wilfully optimistic and unable to countenance anything that doesn\u2019t fit within her plans; Jack\u2019s wounded cynicism undercuts her flights of fancy. But these two voices also allow Price to finely draw the complexities of their family dynamic \u2013 there is so much that they cannot say to each other, and so many ways in which they both want to be seen and supported, despite their radical opposition.

Price explores some of the fascinating overlaps between the wellness community and conspiratorial thinking, especially around the pandemic: Linda chides her children for wearing face masks on their flight, and has refused a Covid vaccine. What is most refreshing about The Pyramid of Needs, though, is its treatment of Jack. The reader knows from the opening chapters that Jack is trans, and while this fact is important to his experiences, and to many of his interactions with his family \u2013 Linda believes, for example, that she has been supportive by giving Jack Supreme Man supplements shortly after his coming out \u2013 it is never the sole feature of his character. This is not a story about identity, and it is still, unfortunately, rare to see a trans character treated with this level of dignity and deep complexity. The Pyramid of Needs is a wickedly funny book \u2013 and while none of Price\u2019s characters are spared the sharpness of its satire, he is nonetheless generous with their foibles, because the greatest failing they all share is a willingness to believe in, or put their faith in, something that gives them some sense of control within their lives. This is its tragedy, as much as it is the fodder for its comedic material, and it makes for a book with a great deal of heart. It is very much about betrayal \u2013 both the betrayal of the faith that pyramid schemes foster in and demand of their operators, and of the ability of the family to understand each other as they grow and change and age. It is an assured debut \u2013 fast-paced, funny and compelling, and deeply affecting too.

That\u2019s just nominative determinism in action. So, a warning: their 11th full-length recording, Invader, may contain traces of their earlier work, especially Unit, their classic album from 1997. Of course, this being Regurgitator, it\u2019s done with a self-awareness and playfulness that heads off charges that the group are simply repeating themselves. Unit\u2019s final track, Just Another Beautiful Story, contained a synthesised orchestral section that nodded towards the Beatles\u2019 Penny Lane. Tsunami, which closes Invader, similarly quotes Dear Prudence. A critical and commercial smash at the time, Unit has been so lionised over the years that it has overshadowed a rewarding and adventurous, if occasionally obtuse body of work. While sales may have slowed, Regurgitator still have a large and devoted live following. And most fans, it\u2019s fair to say, like their old stuff better than their new stuff. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning But Regurgitator still have more than enough new tricks to keep things interesting. They bring in new faces, too: Peaches makes a cameo on This Is Not A Pop Song (which, like Public Image Ltd\u2019s This Is Not A Love Song, it most assuredly is), while Indigenous author Tyson Yunkaporta and rapper JK-47 make key contributions. Even Pseudo Echo\u2019s Brian Canham pops up, albeit only in the video for Invader\u2019s lead track Cocaine Runaway. Everything is crammed in here: the clip pays homage to Kenny Loggins in Danger Zone, while the song features the kind of creamy saxophone solo that bedevilled so much of mid-80s pop, immediately followed by a hair-metal guitar break. It\u2019s a great tune, helped by Quan Yeomans singing better than he ever has. Once prone to mumbling, his voice has matured into a richly textured croon. But Cocaine Runaway is dark: the song\u2019s addled protagonist is on the run, about to dump the body of his girlfriend, in the back seat of his Lamborghini, in the river. Themes of male violence, colonialism and spiritual emptiness dominate. Again, these are old touchstones for Regurgitator \u2013 they were there right from their debut album, Tu-Plang in 1996. But, again, if you stick around for three decades, there is a good chance the times will come to suit you again, and remind everyone else why they liked you in the first place. Like Midnight Oil on their 2020 album The Makarrata Project, this time around Regurgitator clearly felt uncomfortable speaking on anyone else\u2019s behalf. Yunkaporta delivers The Bastard Poem That Nobody Wanted in the middle of the record. Its final line is devastating in its irony: after Australia is rendered uninhabitable, \u201csomebody remembered how to make a boat.\u201d But Regurgitator never succumbs to earnestness, nor loses their sense of fun. Bassist Ben Ely, as always, contributes a solid handful of sharp, snappy retorts to Yeomans\u2019 perfect pop and hip-hop pastiches: Australiyeah and Pest are instantly memorable floor-fillers, or should be. (It was Ely who foretold the band\u2019s future with I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff.) These songs, even throwaways like That\u2019s Not Nermal and Pee Pee Man, balance Yeomans\u2019 more elaborate compositions. He\u2019s in top form here: with no disrespect to Ely, it\u2019s no surprise that This Is Not a Pop Song, Cocaine Runaway and the genuinely epic Epic have all been selected as singles ahead of Invader\u2019s release. And on the two-minute thrash of Wrong People, Yeomans aligns himself with the outcasts that punk has embraced since the Ramones welcomed Pinheads into the fold. The marginalised and the pariahs, the exiles and the refugees, and the plain weird: these are the people he wants to hang out with because, well, they\u2019re just more interesting. What Invader lacks is the genuine shock value Regurgitator brought to the charts in their early years: despite their unmatched flair for swearing, even they can\u2019t write a song like I Sucked a Lot Of Cock To Get Where I Am twice. But this is one of their finest albums, easily their best since 2011\u2019s Super Happy Fun Time Friends \u2013 and right up there with the old stuff, too. Invader is out on Friday (ABC Music/Valve).

Now he\u2019s back, with his first solo show in a decade \u2013 a little older, a little greyer, if not as geriatric as the version of himself he offers up here, swaddled in bathrobe and surgical socks, tapping his way across the stage with a walking stick. The significance of those stylings takes time to reveal itself, and then fairly obliquely. For much of the hour, Beturns is a loosely connected assemblage of playful clown routines, as Burgers invites an audience member to thrash his backside with a rolled-up newspaper, and another to wheel him around the stage on a swivel chair. Using little more than his expressive eyes and a suite of eloquent gestures, the Doctor asserts total if unpredictable control over the crowd. He\u2019ll seduce us with mimed sequences of throbbing hearts and soaring birds \u2013 then puncture proceedings with a sarcastic hand-clap, mocking our delight, or some barely appropriate rough-and-tumble with another hapless volunteer. In the context of recent clown-comedies as high-concept as Julia Masli\u2019s ha ha ha ha ha ha ha and Frankie Thompson\u2019s Catts, Burgers\u2019 return can seem thin.

Few performers are as present \u2013 as alive \u2013 as this, and his impulsiveness, his blithe delinquency, triggers moments of giddy hilarity here. But one or two riffs are eked out or revisited too many times.

It\u2019s a big instrument for its kind and, in the Piano Concerto No 2 \u2013 which began this second concert of the series \u2013 its clear, bright tone was a good match for the orchestra. This wasn\u2019t an overly lyrical performance, even though the song-like slow movement flowed beautifully; it was, however, charged with unflagging energy. Schiff picked out the melodies strongly, even while keeping the busy accompanying figuration brilliantly delicate \u2013 the finale was a reminder that Mendelssohn, who gave the premiere, was himself quite the virtuoso. As an encore Schiff played the Variations S\u00e9rieuses, a heavyweight solo piano piece lasting well over 10 minutes, probably a meatier item than necessary at this point. Certainly by the time we got to the closing moments of the Reformation Symphony, which followed, the performance had taken on an end-of-evening energy, even though there was another whole symphony to come after the interval. Too much of a good thing? Very nearly \u2013 but not quite. Both symphonies found the orchestra sounding invigorated, and nothing dragged. The Reformation Symphony had started with the instruments blending together to sound like an organ \u2013 a small one, nothing too grand \u2013 and finished in a blaze of rasping brass, including the low grumble of a serpent. There was much character and colour in between, with the stereo placing of the violins creating lively effects and with some perky playing in the outdoorsy second movement. In the Scottish Symphony the strings took a moment to settle, but it was the clarinet solos that stole the show, before the work romped home in a delightfully unguarded competition between the four horns on one side and the timpani on the other.

Obviously they cannot both have it \u2013 unless what they both want is peace. The challenge has been and continues to be, both in Europe and elsewhere in the world, to construct a political order which enables competing sides to live in continuing peace, notwithstanding that they cannot each have all that they wish. For each side to insist that the other is overcome does not lead to lasting peace \u2013 as France and Germany and many other places have shown over centuries. The creation of the European Community after the second world war was a serious attempt to accustom opponents, by regularly working together, to try to find answers to what are often common problems, to realise that the other is also human. This attempt has largely been successful. Certainly much more successful than the quest by France after the first world war to secure what it saw as justice. Having served as a judge in this country and in the European court of justice, I of course think that justice is a laudable aim. But I also became acutely conscious of the limitations of what can be achieved, both in the context of criminal and civil law and in the context of international law, by an exclusive focus on what is seen as justice. Justice cannot be the only desideratum and will not always be the most important and exclusive one.

It\u2019s impossible to know just how rich the Beckhams are. The couple, who live mostly in a \u00a330m white stucco townhouse in west London but also own an apartment in Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa, a villa on the nearby Palm Jumeirah, and a super yacht called Seven, have a combined fortune of \u00a3425m. This puts them 325th in the latest comprehensive guesstimate by the Sunday Times rich list. It ascribes most of the wealth to David, who sold a 55% stake in his brand management firm, DB Ventures, to US firm Authentic Brands for \u00a3200m. David joined star names such as Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe, whose brands are part of the Authentic stable, which also includes Reebok, Juicy Couture and Hunter wellington boots. The latest accounts for his company DRJB Holdings \u2013 which stands for David Robert Joseph Beckham \u2013 show revenue in 2022 more than doubled from \u00a334m to \u00a372.6m, although pre-tax profits fell from \u00a323.6m to \u00a310.8m, because of an increase in administrative expenses. The company paid out dividends of \u00a3827,500, down from \u00a36.3m a year earlier. DRJB includes his TV production business, Studio 99, which produced the four-part Beckham documentary on Netflix that took the top spot in 59 countries, and the Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan biopic The Edge of Everything. Victoria Beckham Ltd, which has expanded into bags, fragrances and beauty products as well as fashion, increased revenue by 44% in 2022 to \u00a358.8m, and narrowed pre-tax losses from \u00a35.9m to \u00a33.1m. At an operating level, losses fell from \u00a33.9m to \u00a3900,000 signalling progress on the path to profitability. The directors declared \u201c2022 marks a turning point where the group became profitable\u201d. However, the couple and minority investor private equity firm NEO Investments Partners injected a further \u00a36.9m since the year end. David Belhassen, founder and managing partner of NEO, which invested \u00a330m in VBL in 2017 for an undisclosed but significant minority stake, told WWD magazine recently that sales had increased by 50% and earnings before expenses had \u201csignificantly multiplied\u201d in 2023. \u201cThe house of VB is now fully live, and a reality. It was a dream for Victoria and I when we partnered, and it is happening. We are now embarking on a new phase with only the sky as the limit,\u201d he said. Her Victoria Beckham Beauty business reported a tripling of customers in 2022, and won 28 industry awards. The bestseller is her Satin Kajal liner, which is now available in 17 colours. Jonathan Siboni, chief executive of data intelligence company Luxurynsight, said many people in the fashion industry had been too quick to dismiss Beckham as \u201cjust a Spice Girl and not a businessperson\u201d. \u201cBut they couldn\u2019t have been more wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe brand has succeeded because of her. She has fought back, she has evolved, she has shown huge amounts of resilience. \u201cYes, there have been times when the brand was tacky, and produced things that didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut just like David Beckham as a footballer, you can\u2019t always be the best. What matters is not one game, or even one season, but the big picture.\u201d Siboni said Victoria had succeeded in creating a brand that is \u201cher vision, but also more than just her\u201d. \u201cIn fashion, some brands can\u2019t survive without the founder, others like Dior and Chanel continue to thrive,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has already taken steps to disconnect the Victoria Beckham brand from the person, and even if she is not on TV or social media for a few months, people will still buy her clothes.\u201d She is unlikely to disappear from our screens anytime soon. More than 30 years after the Spice Girls were formed after an advert in the Stage newspaper for \u201cstreetwise, outgoing, ambitious, and dedicated\u201d 18- to 23-year-olds, Beckham still regularly goes viral on social media. Most recently last weekend when all five reunited for an impromptu performance at Beckham\u2019s 50th birthday party at Mayfair private members restaurant Oswald\u2019s in front of Tom Cruise, Salma Hayek and Eva Longoria. She has 39.2m followers on Instagram and 2.2m on TikTok. Andy Milligan, founder of the branding consultancy The Caffeine Partnership and author of Brand It Like Beckham, said he credited a large part of the couple\u2019s success to their seeming authenticity on social media and TV. \u201cThey project an image that, despite their exceedingly glamorous lifestyle, makes them feel approachable, they\u2019re very relatable to us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou saw that in the Netflix documentary when David teases her about claiming to be working class despite her dad driving her to school in a Rolls-Royce, and when he queued with the public to pay his respects to the Queen.\u201d Milligan said he expects the Beckhams\u2019 businesses will continue to grow and \u201cwe will look back on them as a great British export\u201d. \u201cWhat they have as a couple is extremely rare, because they have sport, fashion and popular culture, so they can dominate both the front and back pages.\u201d He says partnering with Mango is likely to turbo-boost Victoria\u2019s brand as it \u201cgives her much more reach with products in physical stores in just about every city I can think of\u201d. Milligan says Victoria has a reputation for picking effective brand and business partners, and Mango works because it is \u201ca desirable brand, and affordable rather than luxury \u2026 which will keep her relevant to a younger generation. \u201cVictoria hasn\u2019t in the past received the credit she deserves as a very smart businessperson. She\u2019s so much more than a Spice Girl, she\u2019s clearly a talented designer and has a brilliant business brain.\u201d", "date": "2024-04-26", "section": "Fashion", "author": "Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent", "id": 193, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/97a3e3c4b2cd479ece7ccc2a5432c716999f2e9e/0_476_8256_4954/500.jpg"}, {"title": "And now for the pinchline: competition crowns world\u2019s funniest crab joke", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/27/and-now-for-the-pinchline-competition-crowns-worlds-funniest-crab-joke", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.043, "neu": 0.688, "pos": 0.268, "compound": 0.9984}, "body": "How did the crab get out of prison?

The answers to these conundrums and other clawsome jokes were among the competitors for the inaugural World\u2019s Funniest Crab Joke competition, held by the Crab Museum in Margate to celebrate International Crab Day. The winning gag, submitted by Leon Price, was: a man walks into a restaurant with a crab under his arm and says, \u201cDo you make crab cakes?\u201d The manager answers, \u201cYes, we do.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d says the man, \u201cbecause it\u2019s his birthday.\u201d An expert panel of judges, including the comedians Harry Hill, Rose Matafeo, Sally Phillips and Phil Wang, as well as children from Ramsgate Arts primary school, scored their favourite jokes before the totals were tallied and a winner crowned. The only rules of the contest were that the jokes should be kept PG, and that lobsters could be mentioned in the setup of the joke, but not the \u201cpinchline\u201d. Organisers said that, although most of the 700 submissions did abide by the rules, several jokes \u201cwere disqualified for scientific inaccuracy, and rather a lot for lewdness\u201d. In an unexpected sideways move, the crabs themselves picked the winner from the four jokes ranked highest by the judges, with the help of some tinned fish in bait bags and rolled-up pieces of paper with the jokes written on them. In second place came another variation on a classic formula: \u201cWhy did the crab cross the road? It didn\u2019t. It used the sidewalk.\u201d Third place was awarded jointly to: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the crab help the chicken cross the road? Because it was eaten by a pelican crossing,\u201d and: \u201cWhat format do you have to save photos of crab soup on to? Floppy bisque.\u201d A Crab Museum spokesperson said the organisers hoped the contest might inspire people into environmental activism: \u201cThe quality and quantity of jokes this year has been astounding. We\u2019ve been pinching ourselves since the submissions closed! That said, laughing at jokes, much like learning about crabs, can be a powerful tool to help us reassess our relationship with our environment. You\u2019d be surprised how quickly you can go from chuckling at crab gags to letting down SUV tires. Whilst we may not have made this clear to our judges, it is in this spirit that the World\u2019s Funniest Crab Joke competition has been organised.\u201d The museum, which opened in 2021 and claims to be \u201cEurope\u2019s first and only museum dedicated to the decapod\u201d, aims to raise awareness of the often unheralded but incredibly diverse world of crabs. \u201cCrabs can teach us about biology, climate change, evolutionary history and much much more. But, with the right frame of mind, they can also teach us about ourselves,\u201d said a spokesperson for the museum, which was founded by Bertie Suesat-Williams, his brother Ned Suesat-Williams and Chase Coley. \u201cThis is why we created Crab Museum, to roll science, humour and philosophy into a unique and satisfyingly baffling day out.\u201d The museum\u2019s award-winning social media presence was called \u201cradical and unhinged\u201d by Digital Culture Network. The full shortlist of crab jokes What do you call a red crab piggybacking another red crab all around the town? A double-decapod. A horseshoe crab walks into a bar. \u201cWhy the ventral face?\u201d the bartender asks. The crab replies: \u201cMind your own business and please tip a pint of lager and a packet of crisps on to the pub carpet.\u201d How did the crab get out of prison? It used its escape claws. Why didn\u2019t the crab help the chicken cross the road? Because it was eaten by a pelican crossing. What did the sea urchin say to the crab? Please sir, can I have some claw? What format do you have to save photos of crab soup on to? Floppy bisque. A man walks into a restaurant with a crab under his arm and says: \u201cDo you make crab cakes?\u201d The manager answers: \u201cYes, we do.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d says the man, \u201cbecause it\u2019s his birthday.\u201d How do barnacles get around? A taxi crab. Why did the crab cross the road? It didn\u2019t. It used the sidewalk. Why did the crab get bad grades? Because it was below C level. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2024.

Forget Afrobeats; the Nigerian duo are on a mission to bring highlife \u2013 an effervescent style that originated in 19th-century Ghana, with its distinctive lilting guitar and lively horns \u2013 to a new generation. Lagos-based brothers Kingsley Chukwudi Okorie and Benjamin Chukwudi James call their sound \u201chighlife fusion\u201d, and bring jazz and soul into their muscular mix. It\u2019s a joyful brew, sung in both English and their native Igbo, and bearing messages of positivity, love and good times. Bassist Okorie and drummer James (who is also the lead singer) started the group in 2018, after finishing their respective law and music degrees, and have since released two albums. Their synergy and virtuosity drips with superstar quality, and their star is rising fast: last year they were selected by Wizkid to support him at his stadium show in the UK, after proclaiming that he was their \u201cbiggest fan\u201d. Not one to be left out, another Afrobeats heavyweight, Davido, enlisted the siblings on his 2023 single Na Money alongside Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo. Like Kidjo, the Cavemen move across sounds and scenes, especially in Britain. After the Wizkid gig, they played jazz festival Love Supreme, south-east London community-minded all-dayer Rally and a few months later, east London\u2019s cult live music night Church of Sound, to an audience so excited they were fanning themselves.

In the early days, I kept a book of every single chocolate I tasted. But life gets in the way of lists and I now trust to memory to highlight the chocolate that stands the test of time. One of the first bars I tasted was Fran\u00e7ois Pralus\u2019s Barre Infernale Orange (\u00a316.95, 160g), a brick of dark chocolate containing praline and candied orange \u2013 but no description can do it justice. It is, to quote Chandler in season 1, episode 7 of Friends, \u2018Perfection!\u2019 It is still the chocolate I recommend most when someone asks, \u2018What shall I give as a present?\u2019 because it\u2019s different and, unless the recipient hates praline, it always, always goes down well. When I went to Paris recently, I was super-tempted to try this again, but instead pushed myself to try something new in the Barre range and went for the coffee version instead. But, coming home, I still hankered after my first love. I couldn\u2019t justify getting it just for myself but, as it\u2019s been some years since I\u2019d tried it, I decided to get it for my Chocolate Club and it was immediately, unanimously and with some excitement declared a 9.8 \u2013 the highest score so far.

In the movies, however, they\u2019re eternally renewable. Take Challengers, Luca Guadagnino\u2019s sleek, sexy, sweat-drenched new film, which hits every metaphor you might expect in its story of three tennis pros locked in a tense love triangle: games are won and lost, points scored, doubles partners swapped, and so on. Shot and paced with the ricocheting energy of a great tennis match, it\u2019s a sports movie that, like many a classic of the genre, understands the parallels between sport and cinema as two great crowd-pleasing pastimes. The sports movie is pretty much as old as movies themselves: for early silent-cinema pioneers at the turn of the 20th century, the movement and momentum of a baseball game or a boxing match made them as dynamic a subject as any for the camera. Charlie Chaplin\u2019s very first appearance as the Little Tramp, in the short Kid Auto Races at Venice, cast him as a disruptive spectator at a racing-car derby. Classic templates for the genre emerged quickly: the Oscar-winning 1931 hit The Champ nailed a structure for the underdog sporting weepie that shaped everything from Rocky to The Wrestler, while the 1944 Elizabeth Taylor vehicle National Velvet minted a million further feelgood stories of plucky athletes defying the odds. (It\u2019s far harder to involve audiences in stories of an athlete who\u2019s born a winner.) Today, the genre continues to thrive, in forms both familiar and more boundary-pushing, from King Richard to The Iron Claw. One of the year\u2019s highest-grossing films so far worldwide is the Chinese smash comedy YOLO, about a downtrodden woman who finds a new lease of life in boxing; it hits every cliche in the book, but proves they still work with audiences. Less expectedly, Rose Glass\u2019s forthcoming neo-noir Love Lies Bleeding (out next week) finds thrilling erotic energy and macabre wish-fulfilment in the niche world of 1980s bodybuilding. You needn\u2019t have any interest in the sport at hand to get caught up in it on film: the best examples of the genre will make you feel the burn. Bend It Like Beckham (2002, director Gurinder Chadha) The world\u2019s most popular sport has a surprisingly spotty record at the movies, but football films work best the more unassuming they are, which is why Gurinder Chadha\u2019s scrappy teen comedy is such an enduring crowdpleaser. The winning story of a British Punjabi girl defying her disapproving parents to pursue her dreams on the pitch, it was a welcome reminder of the sport\u2019s culture-crossing appeal. Best for: Showing girls that football isn\u2019t a man\u2019s world. Bull Durham (1988, Ron Shelton) Baseball may be the most all-American sport there is, conjuring images of wholesome, Norman Rockwell-esque masculinity, but it never looks very sexy, does it? Maybe it\u2019s the kit \u2013 like very tight but oddly unflattering pyjamas. Anyway, this steamy, sweaty, grownup romcom is a glorious exception, powered by the bristling chemistry between Kevin Costner\u2019s veteran minor-league catcher and Susan Sarandon\u2019s dedicated baseball groupie, who shows new players the ropes in her own special way. Director Ron Shelton specialises in sports movies \u2013 he also made the zingy White Men Can\u2019t Jump and re-teamed with Costner for the improbably charming golf comedy Tin Cup \u2013 but this, his first time at bat, remains his best. Best for: Those who like sport as foreplay. Gregory\u2019s Girl (1981, Bill Forsyth) Another disarming, British coming-of-age film built around football, though the beautiful game in this case is less important to its young, awkward characters than a different kind of scoring. Gawky Scottish 16-year-old Gregory (John Gordon Sinclair) is demoted on the football team and hot for his female replacement Dorothy (Dee Hepburn) \u2013 he\u2019s a rare model of masculine humility in the genre, on the pitch and off. Best for: Teenage boys with a bout of puppy love. Hoop Dreams (1994, Steve James) Steve James\u2019s extraordinary documentary portrait of two black Chicago teenagers trying to make their way into professional basketball via the high school leagues was shot over five years, winnowing 250 hours of footage down to one enthralling three-hour epic. It\u2019s one of cinema\u2019s great studies of sport as a vessel of hope: tough futures await its embattled subjects if they don\u2019t make an impression in these few, tender years, as personal and financial setbacks keep making things harder. The challenges of being young, gifted and black in America have rarely been so expansively mapped out on screen. Best for: Demonstrating the intersection of sport and social issues. John McEnroe: In the Realm of Perfection (2018, Julien Faraut) The greatest of all tennis films might just be this underseen documentary. Ostensibly about the famously hotheaded John McEnroe, Julien Faraut\u2019s film rejects dull bio-doc treatment for a thrillingly and suitably experimental study of movement, space and time. Intricately scrutinising a wealth of 16mm footage from McEnroe\u2019s 1984 French Open final, it draws a fevered parallel between cinema and sport, appealing to nerds of multiple persuasions. Best for: Tennis fans convinced of their sport\u2019s ultimate refinement. Lagaan (2001, Ashutosh Gowariker) Test cricket, that most luxuriously time-consuming of all sports, gets a suitably sprawling valentine in this near four-hour Bollywood epic, which examines late-Victorian colonial tensions in a central Indian village through the prism of one crucial cricket match. Challenged by a haughty British army officer to the game, with their tax debt on the line, the oppressed locals begin to learn the unfamiliar sport and \u2013 well, what do you think happens? Contrived to the last, with everyone\u2019s fate hanging on the very last ball, it\u2019s also utterly irresistible, fired by the blazing charisma of Indian superstar Aamir Khan, and sweeping, old-school film craft. Best for: A rousing triumph of good over evil. A League of Their Own (1992, Penny Marshall) \u201cThere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d Blame early-90s misogyny or critical anti-Madonna bias, but Penny Marshall\u2019s buoyant girl-power baseball comedy was treated as little more than agreeable fluff on its release. But it\u2019s aged very well indeed: a warmly classical family entertainment in which the empowering gender messaging doesn\u2019t swamp the spry good spirits of it all. Madonna\u2019s pretty good in it too. Best for: The Venn diagram overlap of baseball and Madonna fans. Or anyone, really. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962, Tony Richardson) The title of Tony Richardson\u2019s hard, sharp 1962 slap of new British realism entered the general sporting lexicon (it was based on Alan Sillitoe\u2019s 1959 book), capturing as it does the romance and severity of a most solitary sport \u2013 surely more people have quoted it than have seen the film. But it remains a beauty: a testament to the head-clearing virtues of athletics, and the occasional power of losing. Best for: The serious, solitary film watcher. Murderball (2005, Dana Adam Shapiro and Henry Alex Rubin) The world of disabled sports hasn\u2019t yet had its crowning mainstream moment in the movies, but this propulsive, Oscar-nominated documentary by Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro was an arthouse hit \u2013 one that could easily have been fashioned into a fictional crowdpleaser. Centred on the very tough guys who play wheelchair rugby, and playing up the rivalry between the US and Canadian teams ahead of the Paralympic Games, it\u2019s less fixated on sob stories than on the kinetic dynamics of the sport itself, amplified by a pummelling metal soundtrack, and the formidable capabilities of its players on and off the court. (It may be rugby, but it\u2019s played on basketball facilities.) Best for: Smashing the ableism of the athletic world. Offside (2006, Jafar Panahi) To most football fans, a 2006 World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain wouldn\u2019t have been much of an event, but in Iranian auteur Jafar Panahi\u2019s sly, humane comedy, it\u2019s the object of a bravely defiant quest. Forbidden by gender law from entering a football stadium, a group of young, football-mad Iranian women disguise themselves as men in the hope of watching their national team play. What ensues isn\u2019t just a political screed \u2013 though it makes a pointed case for not judging Iran by its systemic inequalities \u2013 but a thoughtful, playful essay on degrees of spectatorship, and how sporting patriotism can unify some populations and exclude others. Best for: An unlikely fusion of sport, comedy and politics. Over the Limit (2017, Marta Prus) This bruising documentary by Polish director Marta Prus hasn\u2019t been widely seen, but it\u2019s unforgettable once you do: candidly documenting the abusive training endured by a Russian rhythmic gymnast on the road to the Olympics, it maintains a nervy tension between the pristine physical beauty of her athleticism and the ugly mental warfare behind it. Best for: Edge-of-your-seat viewing of a different kind. Personal Best (1982, Robert Towne) An exceptionally rare Hollywood sports drama focused on queer characters, Robert Towne\u2019s taut, tender film about two female track-and-field athletes whose romance complicates their Olympic training was a box office flop back in 1982. It now stands as a commendably ahead-of-its-time study of sexual fluidity, and while some may decry its male gaze given the subject, the film has a keen, close eye for the wear and tear of the professional athletic body, given added authenticity by the casting of real-life hurdling champion Patrice Donnelly in a lead role. Best for: Any LGBTQ+ sports fans who feel unseen. Raging Bull (1980, Martin Scorsese) The boxing drama is such a vast genre unto itself that I had to curb its presence on this list, but there was no leaving out the harsh poetry of Martin Scorsese\u2019s Jake LaMotta biopic, with its transformational, Oscar-winning Robert De Niro turn as the troubled middleweight champ. A second Oscar went to Thelma Schoonmaker\u2019s editing, the quick, jabbing rhythms of which changed how boxing was shown on film. Best for: Anyone who\u2019s wanted to feel like they\u2019re in the ring. Rocky (1976, John G Avildsen) Likewise, there had to be room for the most beloved underdog story in film history: Sylvester Stallone\u2019s bloated ego and sundry cheesy sequels may have tainted its legacy, but the 1976 original still has honest soul to it, and a gotta-lose-to-win ending that puts a lump in the throat. Best for: Those tired of celebrating the winners. Senna (2010, Asif Kapadia) Anyone who witnessed champion Formula One driver Ayrton Senna\u2019s tragic death in real time during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix is likely still haunted by the memory. Eschewing standard-issue talking heads and voiceover, Asif Kapadia\u2019s elegiac documentary reconjures the memory, but not luridly so, instead seeking the soul of a man who thrived on speed and risk. Brilliantly assembled archival footage, meanwhile, presents the sport itself so viscerally that we understand the obsession for ourselves. Best for: Racing fans in need of a reality check. Small, Slow But Steady (2023, Sh\u00f4 Miyake) One of last year\u2019s overlooked gems, Japanese director Sh\u00f4 Miyake\u2019s stoically moving character study semi-fictionalises a memoir by deaf female boxer Keiko Ogasawara \u2013 the kind of story that could easily be told as a mawkish tearjerker. Instead, Miyake and star Yukino Kishii exercise terse restraint, as the film expands its view to include a whole hard-up, hard-working independent boxing community in modern Tokyo. Best for: A shot of the everyday in a genre given to the exceptional. Sugar (2008, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck) Baseball embodies the American dream for an immigrant Dominican pitcher determined to make it in the US minor leagues: Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck\u2019s lyrical, compassionate indie is both a closeup individual portrait of desperate determination and an illuminating view of national sporting systems that can\u2019t accommodate everyone\u2019s ambition. Best for: Spotlighting the individual struggles in team sports. This Sporting Life (1963, Lindsay Anderson) The battering, ravaging crash and crunch of male bodies in rugby league has never been quite so vividly depicted as in Lindsay Anderson\u2019s rough-and-ready kitchen sink drama. Starring an extraordinary Richard Harris as a Yorkshire coalminer and rugger bugger who can\u2019t shed his combative on-the-pitch demeanour in his domestic life, it\u2019s not much of an advertisement for sport\u2019s redemptive powers, but its portrayal of mutually aggravating physical and mental injuries hits hard. Best for: A cold slap of working-class sporting reality. Tokyo Olympiad (1965, Kon Ichikawa) Akira Kurosawa was initially hired by the Japanese government to document the 1964 Tokyo Olympics on film; when he bowed out, meditative formalist Kon Ichikawa stepped in. His serene, process-driven ode to motion and spectatorship wasn\u2019t the rousing patriotic propaganda the government had in mind, and it was severely recut, but the 165-minute original is a thing of grace and beauty. Best for: Getting yourself amped up for this year\u2019s Games. Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait (2006, Douglas Gordon) Seventeen synchronised cameras follow French midfielder Zin\u00e9dine Zidane over the course of one La Liga match: the surrounding game fades into the background as we zero on one player\u2019s inch-by-inch movement. Football has never been this balletic.

A third of America\u2019s companies are exploring them.\u201d CNBC says: \u201cThis US company tested a 4-day workweek \u2013 and says it made workers happier and more productive.\u201d Newsweek tells us: \u201cMillennials Are Ready For a Four-Day Week.\u201d So why do all of my clients say nope? According to an advocacy organization, more than 300 companies have four-day workweeks and, per the reports above, many others are apparently \u201ctesting\u201d the concept. I admit that I\u2019ve spoken to none of these companies but I\u2019m not sure I have to. I spend my life working with small and mid-sized businesses and I know a PR stunt when I see one. Hey, good for them. In these times of tight labor - it\u2019s a great marketing campaign. \u201cPeople! Come work for us except you don\u2019t have to do as much work and we\u2019ll still pay you the same!\u201d Now that\u2019s a company I want to work for. But ask any business owner about the four-day workweek and you\u2019ll get the eye-roll. No employer who\u2019s currently paying a worker $1,000 a week for 40 hours is going to agree to pay that same worker the same amount for a 32-hour week. My firm has 600 clients. These companies slit paper, coat films, design strip malls, buy and sell auto parts online, mow lawns and repair roofs. They\u2019re mostly owned by people who wake up at 5am and work till 7pm. They don\u2019t have enough people to do the work needed. They don\u2019t have enough money to pay for good health insurance, let alone a robot. Their parking lots need resurfacing, their internet needs upgrading and their coffee pots need to be replaced by Keurigs. These businesses \u2013 like most their size - suffer when a single person calls out sick. Their owners are battling customers who don\u2019t pay, suppliers who don\u2019t deliver and services that don\u2019t function. My little subset of clients \u2013 who represent a tiny sliver of the country\u2019s 30m businesses \u2013 can\u2019t fathom a four-day workweek. To them, this is a fairytale, a dream, a misguided workplace concept driven by media interest that is so unrealistic that few even pay attention to the stories about it. But that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a place for the four-day workweek. All this idea needs is a little bit of rebranding. If you\u2019re an advocate of the four-day workweek you\u2019re going about this all wrong. Instead of working fewer hours for the same pay \u2013 which, again let me confirm, is never going to happen \u2013 you should be pushing for changes in work schedules. Many industries \u2013 like healthcare, home services and retail \u2013 allow flexibility in scheduling so that workers put in four 10-hour days and then have three days off. I know younger workers who have this arrangement at their employers and they love it. Working a 10-hour shift isn\u2019t that much different than an eight-hour shift, but having three days off in a week makes a big difference. This is the kind of four-day workweek an employer should embrace. Allowing your people more flexibility in their scheduling satisfies a very reasonable (and admirable) value championed by today\u2019s younger generations to have a better work-life balance. They\u2019re right about this and smarter than my generation. By adopting a more flexible 10-hour-day schedule your company can tout its own \u201cfour-day workweek\u201d program to current and prospective employees and leverage the current news cycle to help retain and attract more talent. There will always be wily politicians who will take up silly causes like the four-day workweek to fire up their base. There will always be companies aiming to grab the headlines. But here\u2019s the reality: workers who think that corporate America is going to a four-day workweek anytime soon are dreaming. It\u2019s not going to happen. Not in the foreseeable future. Probably not ever. It simply doesn\u2019t make economic sense. But employers can be more flexible and should be if they want to recruit the best talent. That\u2019s the kind of \u201cfour-day\u201d workweek that does make sense to a businessperson.", "date": "2024-04-28", "section": "Business", "author": "Gene Marks", "id": 199, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b583b0927546c06b0583af08fd96dacdf731a163/173_0_5175_3105/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Mitski review \u2013 unusual, enigmatic and utterly compelling", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/apr/28/mitski-review-usher-hall-edinburgh", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.087, "neu": 0.658, "pos": 0.255, "compound": 0.9916}, "body": "A curtain hangs centre stage, as if set for a magician\u2019s disappearing act.

The song ends, the curtain drops, and the \u201cshow\u201d begins. Mitski Miyawaki is no stranger to theatrics \u2013 the indie rock musician\u2019s live performances have grown increasingly conceptual since the break-out success of 2018\u2019s Be the Cowboy and her subsequent three-year hiatus from the music industry.

A self-contained, circular stage becomes a cabaret, a circus, a boxing ring, a cage. Her scalding songs are deployed like controlled explosions, glassily distanced by ingenious lighting and repetitive, gestural choreography. This artful, refined act offers neither catharsis nor release, and instead draws pointed attention to Mitski\u2019s ability to play any role \u2013 the clown, the lover, the outcast, the villain. The set spans a decade of music from five albums, rearranged to suit the new album\u2019s pastoral and sometimes gothic Americana. Pedal steel, fiddle and accordion from Nashville-based musician Fats Kaplin bring out unexpected qualities in older songs (the frosty, frantic, 1980s-indebted Love Me More becomes earthy and eerie) and creates a gravitational pull towards her newer material.

Still a canny operator, however, Seinfeld understands that the last thing anyone in the world wants to hear about is his new Pop Tarts movie. After all, there is realistically only so much available media interest in a streaming period comedy film about a breakfast product. And so Unfrosted has taken something of a backseat to a much more newsworthy proposition: Jerry Seinfeld mouthing off for clicks. Until now, Seinfeld\u2019s targets have included the film industry (the people he worked with \u201cdon\u2019t have any idea that the movie business is over\u201d) and his disdain for dabblers (\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I revile quite as much as a dilettante\u201d), despite being a man who has just directed his first film at the age of 70. True, he has also tried talking about things he actually enjoys, like his love of watching surfing videos on YouTube, but that isn\u2019t really what gets the clicks these days. And so, with some inevitability, Jerry Seinfeld has pulled out the big guns and declared that the left is destroying comedy. Speaking on the New Yorker\u2019s Radio Hour, Seinfeld said: \u201cNothing really affects comedy. People always need it. They need it so badly and they don\u2019t get it. It used to be that you\u2019d go home at the end of the day, most people would go \u2018Oh, Cheers is on. Oh, M*A*S*H is on. Oh, Mary Tyler Moore is on. All in the Family is on.\u2019 You just expected [there will] be some funny stuff we can watch on TV tonight. Well guess what? Where is it? Where is it?\u201d Which isn\u2019t entirely true \u2013 Curb Your Enthusiasm just wrapped up its 25-year-run with a universally beloved episode that Jerry Seinfeld was actually in \u2013 but it\u2019s broadly valid. Despite the glut of streaming services that now run in addition to the major networks, a smaller and smaller percentage of their output is comedic in nature. One answer might be that people are turning online for faster, funnier, cheaper comedy that appeals directly to their tastes. But Jerry Seinfeld has other ideas. \u201cThis is the result of the extreme left and PC crap and people worrying so much about offending other people,\u201d he explained, going on to state: \u201cWhen you write a script, and it goes into four or five different hands, committees, groups \u2013 \u2018Here\u2019s our thought about this joke\u2019 \u2013 well, that\u2019s the end of your comedy.\u201d The problem seems to be that too many people delight in performative outrage these days, and a well-intentioned joke might end up being taken out of context and being escalated to a cancelation-level event. Luckily, the extreme left wasn\u2019t a thing back in Seinfeld\u2019s day, which is why something as famously edgy as \u2013 let\u2019s see \u2013 Cheers was able to stay on air for as long as it did. On the surface, this is an incredibly dreary thing to say, not least because it doesn\u2019t fit Seinfeld as a performer at all. It\u2019s hard to complain that you\u2019re not allowed to offend anybody any more when your stock in trade is deliberately inoffensive comedy. Jerry Seinfeld is a man who has just made a film about some pastry. Unless all the clips and trailers have done a particularly good job of hiding a scene in which one character looks straight to camera and declares that all trans people are an affront to God, Unfrosted probably isn\u2019t going to appall the delicate sensibilities of very many people at all. This is a man, remember, who is proud of his family friendly image. The 2011 HBO special Talking Funny has aged incredibly badly \u2013 it\u2019s a roundtable discussion of comedy that features both Louis CK and Ricky Gervais \u2013 but Seinfeld\u2019s contributions hold up. During his discussion, he defends his decision never to swear onstage, insinuating that it\u2019s an easy way to get laughs. It\u2019s a subject he followed up on a few years later, telling the Guardian: \u201cA person who can defend themselves with a gun is just not very interesting. But a person who defends themselves through aikido or tai chi? Very interesting.\u201d And let\u2019s not forget that, when Seinfeld\u2019s co-star Michael Richards ended his career with a racist rant onstage, Jerry Seinfeld not only brought him on Letterman to explain himself, but treated the incident with such grave intent that at one point he sincerely ordered the studio audience to stop laughing, telling them: \u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d So there have always been gatekeepers to what is and isn\u2019t funny. Indeed, in his own work Jerry Seinfeld has been one of the staunchest gatekeepers of all. Perhaps the problem here isn\u2019t that the extreme left has a stranglehold on comedy.

That ardent lover was Michelangelo, who described Cavalieri in these glowing words in a letter from 1532. If only a portrait of Tommaso survived we could have seen his face, which the fiftysomething artist claimed in a poem was so beautiful it gave him a glimpse of paradise itself. Michelangelo did not just announce his love for this young upper-class citizen of Rome \u2013 who knew the pope and prominent cardinals socially \u2013 in verse and prose. He also gave Cavalieri some of the greatest drawings ever created. Up until this time, the mighty sculptor, painter and architect had used drawing as a tool to develop ideas: but the so-called \u201cPresentation Drawings\u201d he did for Tommaso aspire to be completed works of art. They star in the British Museum\u2019s new exhibition of Michelangelo\u2019s later graphic works, and demand a close look, for these are perhaps the most sublime declarations of gay love in art. That may not be instantly obvious when you look at Michelangelo\u2019s The Fall of Phaeton, from the BM\u2019s own Michelangelo collection. It illustrates a Greek myth, retold by the Roman poet Ovid, of the overconfident youth Phaeton who has borrowed the flying chariot in which his father, the sun god, crosses the sky from dawn to dusk. He\u2019s lost control of the horses so Jupiter, to stop his fiery chariot from burning the earth to a crisp, has struck him down. This is a sculptor\u2019s drawing. You can feel the dead weight of the horses, their blunt mass, as they plummet. Phaeton\u2019s naked upturned body dangles in freefall. On the ground, already in mourning for the doomed youth, his sisters are metamorphosing into poplar trees. There\u2019s a male mourner, too: Cycnus who, as Ovid tells it, loved him and was devastated by his death. In his grief, he transformed into a swan. And it is as a swan that Michelangelo portrays this bereft lover. Other drawings he gave Cavalieri are much more obviously homoerotic to our eyes untrained in classical mythology. In The Punishment of Tityus, an eagle pecks at a man\u2019s naked form. It is a scene of torment, but it\u2019s clear Michelangelo finds pleasure in this pain: the eagle rests on top of Tityus like a lover, and the nude man\u2019s body is tilted to ensure a clear view of his genitals. Instead of a gory depiction of exposed entrails as other artists have pictured it, Michelangelo feasts his and Tommaso\u2019s eyes on a softly shaded, lusciously sensual encounter. In another of these works, which survives in copies, Michelangelo depicted the god Jupiter taking the form of an eagle to carry off Ganymede, a myth with unavoidable \u201csodomitical\u201d implications. It seems to be an obvious wish-fulfilment fantasy in which Michelangelo imagines he is the raptor-god carrying off the naked Tommaso in his talons. But there\u2019s a killer detail. Most Renaissance artists depicted Ganymede as pre-pubescent. Michelangelo makes him a young man. He does that to assert the nobility of true love between men. His declaration of such a love is the triumphant conclusion of a lifelong struggle. You can see it 20 years earlier in the right hand of David, its veins like cables as it tenses, fingers wrapped round a stone. David seethes with contradictions and that hand is famously out of scale, enlarged compared with the rest of him. Why? Well, if we must rationalise, it symbolises the importance of the stone David is preparing to fire from his slingshot. But Salvador Dal\u00ed in his painting The Lugubrious Game offers another explanation. He depicts a male statue holding out a hugely distended right hand like that of David, in a shameful confession of masturbating. If you stand below Michelangelo\u2019s sculpture in the Accademia Gallery, Florence, the right hand of David actually does look Dalinian, close to his lofty groin. Among its many meanings, David is partly about sex. Michelangelo is working out, consciously and unconsciously, the nature of his desires. The tittle-tattle about these desires bothered him so much that he got his biographer Ascanio Condivi to offer a philosophical explanation. Michelangelo does love the male body, acknowledges Condivi, but like the Greek sage Socrates his passion is chaste. Maybe it was, when he created David. Despite writing many love poems, about women and men, and lavishing chalk and ink on drawing naked male models, there\u2019s no record of him having a relationship with anyone before he suddenly declared his passion for Cavalieri. The surreal right hand of David may confess to a lonely man\u2019s consolation. The \u201cGiant\u201d, as it was nicknamed, also shows him working out his own ethics of love. In spite of being a mortal sin and potentially a capital crime, encounters between males were far from unknown in the Renaissance. In Michelangelo\u2019s city-state Florence, the high level of recorded accusations imply many men were having sex with other males before having families \u2013 this wasn\u2019t an identity so much as a rite of passage. And there was a strong social assumption that such sexual encounters involved an age difference \u2013 as when the 24-year old Leonardo da Vinci was accused of sodomising a 17-year old. The biblical hero David was usually portrayed as an adolescent, yet Michelangelo made him an adult, pre-empting the transformation he would give to Ganymede as he declared his love for Cavalieri. There was nothing secret about these feelings. His poems were widely circulated in manuscript and even performed as songs. Cavalieri was so pleased with the erotic drawings he showed them to the pope \u2013 who was impressed. Michelangelo could risk this Renaissance coming out partly because artists were regarded as special and different, their genius liberating them from conventional behaviour. As Michelangelo was thought the greatest of them all, why should he not have licence? He also had the cover of Neoplatonism, which Condivi would later deploy to assert Michelangelo\u2019s chastity. The Florentine scholar Marsilio Ficino defined \u201cPlatonic love\u201d as a lofty desire that leads us from pleasure in someone\u2019s shape (like an Ed Sheeran song) to contemplation of spiritual truth. Michelangelo\u2019s poems to Cavalieri insist he loves him in this way. And yet they go far beyond simply using pop philosophy to cover forbidden impulses. Michelangelo is a great love poet. In these, his most impassioned, complex verses, he genuinely tries to understand how physical desire relates to the more mysterious feeling we call \u201clove\u201d. \u201cIt must have been your eyes,\u201d he writes in a movingly realistic image of falling for Tommaso. Not \u201cit was your eyes\u201d: we get the sense he\u2019s still trying to understand how he fell so intensely in love. But he is sure it is a love that helps him see heaven itself. Let the base rabble gossip all they like, he says in one poem: his emotion is pure. In a letter he puts the same belief into prose: \u201cI\u2019ll forget your name when I forget to eat food, except your name means more than food because that only feeds my body, but you feed body and soul.\u201d Body and soul: for Michelangelo love is about their union. And yet this is no easy synthesis. However much he tries to sublimate physical passion it keeps plaguing him with fantasies and pain. He imagines Tommaso, in lines that play on the equestrian surname Cavalieri, as a forceful knight who ties him up: \u201cAnd if I need to be conquered, a captive, to be in bliss, it\u2019s no wonder, naked and alone, I remain the prisoner of an armed cavalier.\u201d This is not a passing image. Michelangelo set it in stone. While in love with Tommaso he carved, from 1532-4, his sculpture Victory. It portrays a young man who has conquered and subdued an older one. The naked victor straddles his older prisoner \u2013 bearded like Michelangelo \u2013 who humbly accepts his fate. At some point Michelangelo was defeated, perhaps by whispers and malign interpretations of his conduct. Tommaso would marry, taking a wife from an established Roman elite family. Whatever the physical basis of their relationship \u2013 and who hasn\u2019t tried to fathom how our feelings flit between mind and body? \u2013 it was love: as joy, as pain, as a glimpse of the infinite. Through word and image Michelangelo made it universal. When Michelangelo died, aged 88, in 1564, Tommaso de\u2019 Cavalieri was at his bedside.

I grew up idolising a lot of standups: Chris Rock, Maria Bamford, Bridget Christie. I followed Ross Noble around (that sounds creepier than I intended) and watched him do a lot of shows in the early 2000s. At university, instead of doing my degree, there was a three-month period where I did an intensive Richard Pryor study. Through illegal downloading, I got all of his comedy albums and I would listen to each in chronological order and then build up to Live in Concert. I would say the intense focus I devoted to Pryor\u2019s comedy came really at the expense of my degree. And your non-comedy hero? I\u2019m unsettlingly obsessed with Bob Dylan and Andr\u00e9 3000 from Outkast. Any bugbears from the world of comedy? I don\u2019t think good looking people should be allowed to do comedy. I think we should get some sort of legislation passed. It\u2019s not for them. You know what is for them? Literally everything else. Just stay out of comedy, with your symmetrical faces and good bodies. What\u2019s your forthcoming show \u2013 Nish, Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe \u2013 about? It\u2019s a really funny standup comedy show about the slow collapse of humanity as a race. Are you known for killing vibes? The thing about me is that I\u2019m an incredibly fun guy, until I get on to a subject on the news, at which point I\u2019m the least fun guy. I oscillate between being a vibe killer and a vibe encourager. I am in total control of the vibe. I can make it flourish or I can make it collapse around me. Like a dying star. You spoke about audience behaviour worsening since lockdown. Are you seeing any improvement? Things have settled back down recently. I think it was just that initial wave of coming back and people were not quite able to regulate how drunk they were. That was just a period where we all needed to readjust to being back out in public. Which makes sense given that we went through a collective trauma. Best heckle? There is no such thing as a good heckle. No hecklers have brought anything useful to a gig. Occasionally someone will say something involuntarily then immediately apologise for it, and the thing they say will always be 100 times funnier than anyone who deliberately and consciously heckles. It\u2019s one of the greatest myths about comedy that heckling helps at all. Any pre-show rituals? Just one. Nando\u2019s. I\u2019m not being paid to advertise them and other chicken shops are available. Do you have a go-to order? Before a show, half a chicken, extra hot, supergrain salad. If I\u2019m eating there in my spare time: half a chicken, extra hot, chips and coleslaw. I can\u2019t have chips before a gig because no one wants to see a man burp through an 80-minute comedy show. Worst advice you\u2019ve ever been given? I was once given some pretty horrendous advice by a comedy agent. They told me I should do a broad, racist Indian accent in an audition. I would hope things have moved on for younger acts from ethnic minority backgrounds but it was truly awful advice. Best advice you\u2019ve ever been given? It\u2019s not even really advice but there\u2019s an Outkast line where he says, \u201cYou\u2019re only as funky as your last cut.\u201d Which is I guess is a cooler way of saying you\u2019re only as good as your last gig. But I prefer to hear it in Andr\u00e9\u2019s voice. Your colleague James Acaster is in the new Ghostbusters film. Would you like to star in a Hollywood movie? It would be very cool if I was named the next James Bond, because the collective meltdown it would inspire in a section of the British press would be so profoundly hilarious that I almost think Barbara Broccoli should do it as a prank. They\u2019ve made enough money from the franchise, why not make the next casting of James Bond an elaborate prank? I think it\u2019s a longer journey obviously to imagine me as a spy than it is to Acaster as a Ghostbuster because, let\u2019s face it, the guy is a fucking nerd.

Glass Lewis, an influential shareholder advisory group, has urged investors to vote against the online grocery group\u2019s remuneration policy and performance share plan at its annual shareholder meeting, flagging \u201cegregious remuneration practices\u201d. Glass Lewis said \u201cwe remain concerned about the potential for excessive remuneration\u201d and \u201cquestion the need for this enhanced incentivisation tool\u201d. Dan Howard from the campaign group ShareAction, which heads up the Good Work coalition representing $6.6tn in assets under management, said he planned to ask Ocado\u2019s board why it was comfortable proposing the multimillion-pound pay package for Steiner while \u201crefusing to pay hundreds of its workers a real living wage of \u00a312 an hour\u201d. He urged the company to become accredited to the independently verified Living Wage Foundation scheme which each year calculates the minimum hourly earnings required to cover the cost of living. Those who sign up must pay all employees and third-party contractors at least the minimum rate. \u201cOcado has been talking about addressing low pay for five years but has yet to make a long-term commitment. Today we\u2019re calling on the board to pay the real Living Wage \u2013 this would make a significant difference to the lives of hundreds of its lowest-paid workers,\u201d Howard said. He said Ocado\u2019s pay policy meant it was lagging behind industry peers such as Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks &amp; Spencer, all of which have committed to pay their staff at least the real living wage. The online grocery tech group wants to launch a scheme under which Steiner could receive a bonus worth up to 1,800% \u2013 or an \u201cenhanced multiplier\u201d \u2013 of his \u00a3824,570 base salary if its share price hits \u00a329.69 in three years\u2019 time and other performance targets are met. Ocado shares hit \u00a329 during the pandemic when online shopping surged, but have since fallen, closing at 353p on Friday. He would receive an award worth 600% of his base salary, or almost \u00a35m, if targets for total shareholder returns and other performance measures are met but the share price goal is missed. Ocado is no stranger to battles with shareholders over high pay. The latest scheme is intended to replace an earlier long-term bonus plan known as the \u201cvalue creation plan\u201d (VCP) which is expiring in 2027. Ocado said it wanted to replace that scheme because \u201cunprecedented volatility\u201d in its share price had \u201cserved to undermine the impact of the VCP scheme to the extent that it is no longer motivating or retentive to many of its participants.\u201d In 2022, Ocado shareholders rebelled against high pay for directors at the online grocery specialist, with almost 30% voting against a plan to pay Steiner up to \u00a3100m over the following five years. Despite the protest vote, Ocado went ahead with a three-year extension to the VCP, under which Steiner could earn up to \u00a320m a year and other executives up to \u00a35m each. Ocado declined to comment but in its annual report, the chair of the remuneration committee, Julie Southern, said: \u201cMy belief, and that of the committee, is that these new proposals preserve a focus on the level of ambition which is so important to Ocado, while continuing to ensure our remuneration structures align the interests of our senior management team directly with those of our shareholders. \u201cThey offer substantial comparative reward for transformational performance while migrating to a structure that will be more motivating and retentive for executives, better suited to attracting senior new hires, and acceptable to a wider group of our shareholders.\u201d", "date": "2024-04-29", "section": "Business", "author": "Sarah Butler", "id": 205, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6243c436507dfc97cd6f6901a6b09752262f3379/0_5_3500_2099/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Swearing, snogging and spying: Cherub\u2019s cool teenage secret agents hit 20", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/30/cherub-cool-teenage-spies-hit-20-robert-muchamore", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.126, "neu": 0.649, "pos": 0.225, "compound": 0.992}, "body": "As a keen teenage reader in the noughties, I was a devout fan of Anthony Horowitz\u2019s spy series Alex Rider. \u201cWhat if James Bond was a teenager?\u201d proved a compelling premise and even the truly terrible film adaptation didn\u2019t put me off. But on a visit to my local library, I discovered a series with a completely different angle on the life of an adolescent undercover agent. That series was called Cherub, and it was first published 20 years ago today. The young intelligence operatives of Robert Muchamore\u2019s books were recruited from children\u2019s homes and troubled lives by a super-secret wing of British intelligence. Cherub agents could go where grown-ups couldn\u2019t for the simple reason that adult crooks would never suspect children of spying. These kids didn\u2019t have fantastical gadgets or battle world-ending stakes like Rider, but they did have real teenage problems alongside their work infiltrating drug gangs and terror cells. They swore and snogged: in the sanitised world of early noughties YA literature, before The Hunger Games took mass child murder mainstream, it felt revolutionary. \u201cYou\u2019d go into the children\u2019s bookshop and all the books are very pretty, and the kids sit cross-legged on the carpet. It\u2019s this very cosy, very nice, very desirable world,\u201d says Muchamore. \u201cThe only problem with that is, when you\u2019ve got an 11 to 14-year-old boy and they\u2019re playing PlayStation games and they\u2019re starting to think about girls, they kind of reject that. At the time, it just really hit me that there was nothing really that appealed to the way I felt when I was a 13-year-old boy.\u201d The series began in 2004 with The Recruit, in which 11-year-old James Adams joined Cherub after his mum\u2019s death and infiltrated a rural commune to foil an anthrax attack by eco-terrorists. By the time the third book, Maximum Security, came around, 13-year-old James entered the violent crucible of an Arizona supermax prison to bust out the son of a global arms dealer. Things only got rougher. In 2006\u2019s Man vs Beast, animal liberationists force-fed sink cleaner to a TV chef and 2007\u2019s Mad Dogs began with a clash between rival gangs that culminated in a Cherub agent being stabbed multiple times. \u201cI must admit there was part of me that was a bit mischievous and used to try and get away with as much as I could. It was almost like a challenge,\u201d Muchamore says. The books weren\u2019t without controversy. A London junior school withdrew an invitation for Muchamore to speak and promptly banned the series, citing concerns from parents. Supermarkets also received complaints, which prompted publishers to add a \u201cnot suitable for younger readers\u201d sticker to subsequent editions. Muchamore didn\u2019t mind, though. \u201cFor the right kind of reader, it was actually quite cool. They quite liked the fact it had a sticker on that meant it was a bit risque. So it actually worked in all ways.\u201d Muchamore also separated himself from other kids\u2019 authors by being hugely accessible to his fans. He has always answered reader emails himself and, during the peak of Cherub, he was a regular presence on a vibrant online forum dedicated to the series \u2013 a fascinating relic of the era before Facebook and Twitter were dominant. \u201cA lot of people slag the internet off and say it\u2019s terrible for kids and they spend all their time and it\u2019s harmful, and it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d says Muchamore. \u201cBut the fact that people from disparate social groups with marginal interests can actually go online and communicate and make friends, I think that\u2019s amazing. I honestly think I would have been a much happier teenager if I had a group like the Cherub forum, and a bunch of people like me who had the same interest.\u201d While Muchamore is now focused on his series of modern Robin Hood stories, Cherub remains his biggest success. There are fans in all corners, from young offenders institutions to Hollywood \u2013 Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, who has been pictured wearing the series\u2019 distinctive logo, revealed he loved the series in a 2014 Metro interview. While the Cherub books might have been seen as the \u201canti-Alex Rider\u201d series, Muchamore says he has had dinner with Anthony Horowitz, to have \u201ca sit down and a chat with my so-called rival\u201d, and found him to be \u201ca very nice and charming chap\u201d. There might not be any bad blood between the authors, but James Adams would definitely want to give Alex a good slap.

I loved Jurassic Park. I loved Back to the Future. I loved things I probably wasn\u2019t supposed to watch, like Predator. And then of course I loved all the Disney classics. To go to a world that isn\u2019t your own is so exciting. I wanted to tell stories like that.\u201d It was this desire that saw him first take to the stage in school plays, and then to eschew university in favour of drama school \u2013 although his parents persuaded him to apply to both, just in case. \u201cThere was nothing else I wanted to do,\u201d he says. The gamble paid off as he has landed some huge roles \u2013 including being the first disabled actor to play Richard III at the RSC, and co-starring in the BBC drama Then Barbara Met Alan, the first primetime drama about the disability rights movement. To hear him tell it, his whole career has been one big thrill. With Shardlake, his new drama out tomorrow on Disney+, Hughes got what he wanted: the show is nothing but adventure. Set during the reign of Henry VIII, Shardlake has a classic quest at its core. Hughes plays the title role \u2013 a lawyer sent out by Thomas Cromwell to solve a grisly murder in a remote monastery. Filming \u201cwas intense\u201d apparently. \u201cWe were doing some six-day weeks, 12-hour days. I\u2019d shut my eyes at the end of the day and when I opened them I was back riding the horse. But it was great. We were travelling all around Eastern Europe. We were in castles, on horses \u2013 up to my neck in a bog!\u201d He grins. Whichever of Hughes\u2019s many roles we talk about, he can\u2019t disguise how much fun he had. This seems in contrast to the roles themselves, which are often complex, brooding, gnarly characters, from Shakespeare\u2019s scheming Richard III to troubled-yet-brilliant disability activist Alan Holdsworth in Then Barbara Met Alan. But perhaps that is part of the fun for Hughes, who, as a disabled actor, is determined to portray disabled characters in their full complexities. Early in his career, Hughes played parts that existed only as a \u201cpunchbag or sob story\u201d, but now he has learned to use the subversion of audience assumptions to both dramatic and comedic effect. \u201cPeople expect disabled characters, disabled people, to be one thing. So you do something else. That unexpected edge can be your power.\u201d This is true, he adds, beyond the stage. As Shardlake, he really gets to play with these perceptions. Shardlake might have been a one-dimensional character \u2013 a principled lawyer out to find the truth while conniving people try to manipulate his work for their own nefarious ends. But Hughes knows that, in many ways, that would only reinforce a stereotype of disabled people as saint-like but feeble and at the mercy of others. So he insists on playing Shardlake as a good fighter. \u201cHe does not present as a formidable adversary,\u201d he says, \u201cbut he\u2019s actually very strong, very quick.\u201d Hughes was saddened by the death last week of CJ Sansom, the writer of Shardlake. \u201cHe gave us such an incredible body of work,\u201d he says. \u201cShardlake came into my life quite poignantly this year and it was an honour to bring him to the screen. I relayed a few messages to Chris while making our show and he received them warmly. In Matthew Shardlake, he created a hero of the Tudor period who was complex, modern, unique and enduring. I hope we did him proud.\u201d Shardlake, Hughes adds, lives \u201cin a world where the devil is real, curses are real, and people make the sign of the cross when they notice his disability\u201d. And he is keen to show how the prejudice Shardlake experiences has made him resilient and, at times, impenetrable. \u201cI wanted to portray the armour of him \u2013 the strength and the resilience that make him quite a stocky, immovable character. He\u2019s a kind of Lone Ranger, built to withstand people\u2019s prejudices as well as the violence of that time. But even if the hurt of an insult will not register on the face, it will register inside.\u201d As a disabled person watching the show, I tell Hughes that what struck me is how modern those instances of prejudice feel. Disabled people are still prayed over or underestimated, half a millennium on from Henry\u2019s reign. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this is why being a disabled actor playing this part is so important. Just to know what it\u2019s like to be stared at, to know what it\u2019s like to feel different, or like people are wary of you or don\u2019t know what to do around you. That\u2019s why disabled actors should play disabled characters.\u201d However, he adds, it\u2019s just as important for them to play roles that aren\u2019t focused on disability, to show that disabled people lead all kinds of lives. Shardlake provides exactly this kind of incidental representation, the kind Hughes most values. Disability isn\u2019t ignored or centred, it\u2019s just part of the story. It feels authentic. The same was true in the play he credits as his big break. \u201cIt was the first job where I didn\u2019t immediately go back to those in-between, regular jobs when it finished.\u201d The production, The Solid Life of Sugar Water, was put on by Graeae, a company made up of deaf and disabled actors and crew, and written by Jack Thorne, who was later one of the writers behind Then Barbara Met Alan. The play toured the UK. Its success \u2013 and the fact that he found himself surrounded surrounded for the first time by disabled people \u2013 changed Hughes\u2019s life. \u201cIt was my first proper play,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first two-hander. It was very intense subject matter and intense work for us. We never left the stage. It was an hour and 10 minutes about a couple trying to reconnect sexually after they\u2019ve lost a child quite late in the pregnancy. But it was funny. It was devastating. It was weird.\u201d Hughes and his co-star, Genevieve Barr, were the only two cast members. They are both disabled but the story wasn\u2019t about that. It was about showing disabled people, so often \u201clabelled extraordinary but really just ordinary\u201d, in a situation that was itself both of those things. That phrasing, the extraordinary ordinariness of disabled life, calls to mind the true story behind Then Barbara Met Alan, in which a disabled couple lead the charge for the UK\u2019s first disability rights law. What was it like to play Alan, a role for which disability is so central to the character\u2019s external and internal lives? \u201cIt was a turning point,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been around so many disabled people or learned so much about our history. So it was huge. I think in the past I\u2019ve hidden my disability. I literally used to put it [my arm] in my pocket, which hurt my back. After this job, I felt prouder. I walked taller. And the best thing was that I got to speak to Alan quite a bit, and eventually meet him. So much of what\u2019s good for my generation of disabled people \u2013 our rights, our joys \u2013 is because of what Barbara and Alan fought for.\u201d Hughes is delighted by the positive reaction the show received and its success in bringing a largely unknown story to a wide, mainstream audience. \u201cPeople might remember the Piss on Pity protests in London but they don\u2019t know about the nationwide action, the wheelchair users chaining themselves to buses. And we got to show all that, and the great disabled culture these people were part of.\u201d The whole project, like the resulting show, sounds like a riot of fun and fury. Where does the adventure lead next? \u201cHopefully more Shardlake,\u201d he says immediately, grin returning. \u201cBut first a few holidays, a few music festivals\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s looking forward to Glastonbury \u2013 \u201cand in terms of work, I\u2019m waiting to hear about a few things, auditioning, waiting for the phone to ring. Some staring into the abyss.\u201d He laughs, \u201cBut the abyss often provides.\u201d \u2022 Shardlake begins on Disney+ on 1 May", "date": "2024-04-30", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Lucy Webster", "id": 207, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/79bee17ef56f9bf50081880fad31eb4f7196bb9f/0_75_3000_1800/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Hell\u2019s Kitchen and Stereophonic lead 2024 Tony nominations", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/apr/30/tony-awards-nominations", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.084, "neu": 0.686, "pos": 0.23, "compound": 0.9962}, "body": "This year\u2019s Tony nominations are led by Alicia Keys musical Hell\u2019s Kitchen and 70s-set music drama Stereophonic both with 13 nods each.

After two successive quarters of 0.1% contraction in the second half of 2023, the 20 nations that use the single currency posted growth of 0.3% between January and March. Figures from the European Commission\u2019s statistical agency \u2013 Eurostat \u2013 showed the eurozone had put in its best growth performance since the third quarter of 2022. Financial markets had been expecting 0.2% growth. Lower energy prices, falling inflation, rising real wages and the prospect of cuts in interest rates helped to boost activity after a downbeat 2023 in which the eurozone only grew in one quarter. Europe\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 grew by 0.2%, while Italy and Spain posted growth of 0.3% and 0.7% respectively. Germany\u2019s performance in the final three months of 2023 was worse than originally thought: the economy contracted by 0.5% rather than 0.3%. Of the smaller EU economies, the best performing were Ireland, which grew by 1.1% in the first three months of 2024, and Latvia, Lithuania and Hungary, which expanded by 0.8%. Separate Eurostat data showed headline eurozone inflation remained unchanged in April at 2.4%, while core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy and food \u2013 came down from 2.9% to 2.7%. Although the eurozone\u2019s growth performance in the first quarter was stronger than the European Central Bank had been forecasting, analysts said lower inflation paved the way for interest rate cuts in the months ahead. Sam Miley, the managing economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \u201cThis morning\u2019s confirmation of quarterly growth in the first quarter has put an end to a short-lived recession in the eurozone, with the economy having turned a corner since the beginning of 2024. \u201cProspects are likely to improve further throughout the year, driven by the expectation of interest rate cuts.\u201d Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWhile the eurozone\u2019s mild recession appears to be over, we think the economy will expand at only a moderate pace over the rest of the year.\u201d Some of the improvement in the first three months of 2024 was due to temporary factors, such as a rebound in construction, while business surveys also pointed to sluggish growth, Kenningham said. UK first quarter growth figures are due out next week, with the financial markets anticipating 0.3% growth and an end to the mild recession recorded in the second half of 2023. Figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage approvals for house purchases rose from 60,500 in February to 61,300 in March, taking them to the highest level since September 2022. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will make its latest decision on interest rates next week, but is expected to leave official borrowing costs unchanged at 5.25%. \u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2024.

The adroit self-consciousness of his writing made him our supreme post-modernist. If his imagination seemed so spacious it was because he was as much a European as an American writer. If he had Thoreau at his back, he also had Beckett. It is possible to cross a Paul Auster Platz and walk down a rue Paul Auster. Not many novelists have been so honoured. As a presence he was ridiculously handsome, worldly, generous, funny and, unlike most great talkers, a highly attuned listener. *** Joyce Carol Oates: \u2018He was a monumental literary presence\u2019 American writer Paul Auster was an anomaly: a thoroughly warm, witty, sympathetic, laughter-loving individual, with insatiable intellectual curiosity and a gift for friendship; at the same time, he was a monumental literary presence, somewhat intimidating for the zeal with which he immersed himself in his writing, near-overwhelming in the abundance of his creative energies. Within a few minutes you might find yourself discussing a particular author\u2019s inimitable prose, and then, like the flaring of a match, you were off and running. All other subjects faded away. Indeed, the last time we did an event together, just two of us on a panel at the fabled Brooklyn Book festival, whatever the subject was supposed to have been, Paul and I talked nonstop about Stephen Crane, happily quoting his sentences to one another. Paul wrote many brilliant works but I feel that I must mention two I particularly admire. Firstly, Burning Boy, his biography of Crane, which looms large among the great literary biographies of the past decades \u2013 literally, at 800 pages, and luminous, a truly extraordinary portrait of a fellow writer by another, entirely different sort of writer. Paul\u2019s poignant memoir of his father, The Invention of Solitude, is a beautifully poetic work, a meditation upon the very limits of language and our ability to know one another. *** Robert McCrum: \u2018We have lost a passionate, gentle, wise, and noble soul\u2019 British writer and associate editor of the Observer It\u2019s hard to believe that Paul Auster, who seemed forever young, has just entered the pantheon of American letters, and so memorably on May Day. To me, he has always been a mix of Puck and Ishmael, at once playful and fateful, but never less than a tangible voice and presence, even when offstage. Somehow, it\u2019s as if a writer, who always shaped his story as he wanted, has lost control of the narrative-line. I first met him when his New York Trilogy had just been published in the UK. Auster was a romantic figure married to another notable contemporary, the writer Siri Hustvedt, his beloved and ethereal muse, both equally blessed with a gift for friendship. This was the 1980s, an age of irrational exuberance. With their daughter Sophie banging her spoon in her high chair, this family seemed like the privileged inhabitants of a brave new world. New York and its suburbs was Auster\u2019s turf, immortalised not just in his fiction but also in movies like Smoke and Lulu on the Bridge. His conversation, inflected with the accents of the street, and refracted through the academy, flowed like the thrilling dialogue of a novel-in-progress. In person, and on the page, Paul was a natural raconteur. Few writers I\u2019ve ever known could command his appearance with such a spell-binding grasp of an audience. Even fewer possessed his mastery of voice and story, a universal gift: in America, he was an uber-cool easterner; in France, half French; in Britain, the face of a certain avant garde. If that seemed effortless and natural, and all of a piece with his persona, it also concealed Auster\u2019s lifelong dedication to the art of prose fiction. I know, indeed, that he continued to write throughout the final days of his tragic endgame. As an artist, his circle encompassed many great performers and auteurs of stature, including magicians and poets. As a writer, his models, whom he spoke and wrote about as friends, included Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen Crane and Samuel Beckett, the enigma he\u2019d known in 1960s Paris. This was his preferred society. On our last outing together, we went on a pub crawl through places some of his favourite writers had spent time: Gough Square (Dr Johnson), and Bunhill Fields (William Blake), and Poet\u2019s Corner (Alexander Pope). Every folio of his next manuscript was a kind of homage to these mentors. Like all great writers, he never ceased, in Auden\u2019s numinous words, \u201ccommuning with the dead\u201d. I can hardly believe that he is now in their company. America and the world has lost a passionate, gentle, wise, and noble soul, a literary voice for the ages. *** Colum McCann: \u2018He was quite extraordinary\u2019 Irish novelist On 19 August 2022, Paul Auster gathered with a dozen other writers for a PEN event in support of Salman Rushdie, who had been viciously stabbed a week earlier. Paul stood on the steps in his customary black, his grey hair swept back, and read, with great verve, Rushdie\u2019s words about the importance of novel-making in the poisoned narrowness of our times. One of the things that Paul always stood for was the ability to think concretely and sympathetically, contrapuntally, about the world within, in order to also acknowledge the wider world around us. We must understand the lives beyond our own. Open the curtains. Unlock the coordinates. This happens, Paul suggested, within the labyrinthian nature of storytelling. I recall reading his early novellas \u2013 it felt like he was splitting open the atom. A street in Brooklyn swept itself out to the rest of the world. And Paul himself was quite extraordinary. His laugh wasn\u2019t just explosive, it was embracing. Those dark eyes were often described as hooded, and indeed they were, but they also worked as umbrellas. Come in under here. Stand a moment with me. Let\u2019s watch the rain and maybe even make sense of it. One of the things I will recall the most was his sense of solidarity on that day of the PEN event, just two years ago, when he stood up for Salman and said to the man who lay beyond in a hospital bed: \u201cI love you as a brother and treasure the friendship we have built together for the past 30 years.\u201d Earlier that morning Paul was in a room in the library getting ready for the readings alongside his wife Siri. We were chatting about the terrible events, and Paul turned slightly, caught us with those eyes and said: \u201cBut you kill off the closed mind with the open one.\u201d One of the beauties of literature is that it remains with us even beyond death, and the thing we can celebrate is that we will have Paul\u2019s words still speaking to us down through those years yet to come. *** Benjamin Markovits: \u2018He conveyed the intensity of ordinary life\u2019 British-American novelist I first read the New York Trilogy while staying at a downtown hotel in S\u00e3o Paulo by the side of a dingy rooftop swimming pool. It was summer and hot and very bright among all the skyscrapers but you also had a sense, somewhere a long and noisy way below, of life operating at a totally different scale. Book and cityscape seemed to match, Auster\u2019s lucid, simple prose and the very unsteady narrative ground underlying it. He was famous of course for his metafictional detective games, but what stuck with me wasn\u2019t the meta part, but the fact that those games allowed him to convey the intensity of ordinary life, especially ordinary loneliness. Like detectives, we live by our almost obsessive attention to details, bathroom trips, worries about money, who said what to whom. His latest novel, now his last, Baumgartner, is about a widower who tries to reconstruct a meaningful life for himself after his wife\u2019s death: \u201cFor the first six months he lived in a state of such profound confusion that there were times when he would wake up in the morning and forget that Anna was dead.\u201d But that confusion is also a source of comfort if not of hope. It is a moving bookend to a brilliant career. *** Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson: \u2018He played with ideas of coincidence and doubling\u2019 Irish author and artist In the autumn of 2013, I was presenting a Book Show for RT\u00c9 radio and my producer and I went to New York, armed with a dizzying schedule of people to record. Our last interview of the first day, as jetlag started to kick in, was Paul Auster. We had been invited to the Brooklyn brownstone he shared with his wife, Siri Hustvedt. Over the course of a couple of hours, we wandered around, marvelling at their book collection, meticulously organised by theme (\u201cThat\u2019s contemporary American fiction right there\u201d) and the art on the walls: two Gerhard Richter pieces that were gifted to Hustvedt after she wrote essays about the artist\u2019s work, and a piece made by a neighbour, the writer Jonathan Safran Foer, which seemed to consist largely of an antique optometrist\u2019s kit. The inside of Auster\u2019s house reflected the themes in his work \u2013 writing, art and ways of seeing. He believed in and played with ideas of coincidence, doubling and doppelgangers. Echoes and double exposure populate his narratives. Although a New Jersey native, New York, its psychology and geography are indelibly stamped on his novels and screenplays. In the interview he spoke about making a pilgrimage to Dublin as a young man to follow in the footsteps of James Joyce. He spoke frankly about his writing process and showed us his beloved Olympia typewriter. Its worn keys looked suspended, as if constantly awaiting the return of his hands. That evening, we also met and interviewed Hustvedt, who I\u2019m thinking of today with this great loss. Auster spoke of her with such love and admiration: \u201cShe\u2019s probably the smartest person I\u2019ve ever known and she\u2019s essentially my only reader \u2026 it\u2019s been a blessing\u201d. *** James Meek: \u2018He was a kind and generous writer\u2019 British novelist and journalist The New York Trilogy is one of those thrilling, frightening works that connects us, however briefly, to a space just beyond our own, and Paul will, rightly, be forever celebrated for it. But I would also like to record what a kind and generous writer he was in person. I met Paul and Siri at the Icelandic literary festival 20 years ago, and they couldn\u2019t have been warmer or more friendly. Paul, among a daunting roster of celebrities, vied with Margaret Atwood as the biggest name: when he read from his work at the main theatre in Reykjavik, people were crowded around the entrance, unable to get in, but trying to hear him. His reading voice was deep, hypnotic, otherworldly. We met again over the years, but it was that week in Iceland that left the deepest impression: his incredible stamina, bringing a furious competitive energy to a writers\u2019 football match after a long night on the wine, the freshness he brought, in an interview, to the famous story of how City of Glass came to be written \u2013 a story he must have told a thousand times \u2013 his tolerance of other people\u2019s personal crises, including mine, and his unaffected warmth towards writers as a class, especially the younger ones coming through. He told us about a French literary initiative he\u2019d taken part in: dozens of famous writers from all over the world were asked to nominate a young writer they admired, with the idea that the established name and the newcomer would take part in an event. After he\u2019d made his choice, the organisers came back to him to say he was the only writer on the list who\u2019d been able to come up with a young writer they admired. One of the people they\u2019d asked had said: \u201cThere are no young writers.\u201d Paul had a look of real indignation, and surprise, on his face.

As a middle child, I can already hear my older sister quietly rejoicing at this phrase (I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t sent me the TikTok). Can you talk us through what the video is about? I have been itching to talk about this, Claire. In the video you reference, a licensed marriage and family therapist from the US \u2013 Kati Morton \u2013 explains eldest daughter syndrome (or \u201cEDS\u201d) as a \u201cterm coined to describe the unique pressures and responsibilities placed on to the oldest daughter of the family\u201d. Morton argues that those with eldest daughter syndrome are \u201cresponsible for more domestic labour\u201d than other siblings. I actually don\u2019t believe in birth order determining personalities, and you know why? Because as the youngest daughter of three, I actually think I have eldest daughter syndrome (shocking \u2013 as the youngest child \u2013 to make this about myself, I know). Much like the syndrome itself, this is not based in fact, but in feeling. I once went to a tarot reader with my mother and the lady looked at me and went: \u201cThe birth order in your family is all WRONG \u2013 you are actually acting like the eldest daughter while your sister is acting like she\u2019s the youngest.\u201d Like your sister, Claire, I also quietly rejoiced in that moment. Well, isn\u2019t this is an unexpectedly perfect response! Not to go past the tarot cards (please tell me more about that later), but you mentioned this syndrome isn\u2019t based on fact? Morton says in her video that eldest daughter syndrome is not an official mental health diagnosis. I dug through Google Scholar in hopes of finding something \u2013 anything \u2013 from an expert, and nothing. Even though Morton agrees there\u2019s nothing scientific about it (yet), she goes into depth about the eight signs that you could have eldest daughter syndrome. Here they are if you need a checklist: 1. \u201cYou have an intense feeling of responsibility.\u201d 2. \u201cYou are an overachiever, type A and very driven.\u201d 3. \u201cYou worry a lot and probably have anxiety.\u201d 4. \u201cYou struggle with people-pleasing behaviours.\u201d 5. \u201cYou have a hard time placing and upholding boundaries.\u201d 6. \u201cYou resent your siblings and family.\u201d 7. \u201cYou struggle with feelings of guilt.\u201d 8. \u201cYou have a difficult time in your adult relationships.\u201d Right, so what are other people saying about it online? Do the \u201coverachiever, type A and very driven\u201d eldest daughters around the world agree? SO MANY people agree, which is why it\u2019s been trending since 2022. A majority of the comments under the many eldest daughter syndrome videos on TikTok are from eldest daughters and they say things like: \u201cNot sure if I feel attacked or seen, lol\u201d or \u201cAll 8. Do I get a prize or something?\u201d Yang Hu, a sociology professor at Lancaster University, describes eldest daughter syndrome in the Conversation as \u201cemotional burden eldest daughters tend to take on in many families from a young age\u201d. But what\u2019s interesting to me is that among those comment threads, every so often you\u2019ll read a comment from a youngest child like myself, shouting in exasperation that they are in fact the eldest daughter. I felt about six out of eight of Morton\u2019s eldest daughter syndrome signs. So boohoo big sisters, if this is a competition? Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning I don\u2019t want to start a war as a classic middle child (often overlooked, forgotten but the most fun!) \u2013 but wouldn\u2019t the oldest sibling feel more responsible and emotionally intelligent because they are (thanks to timing and birth order) quite literally more mature than their siblings? For most families, I think that would be true. Some of the eldest daughters I\u2019ve spoken to have said they\u2019ve handled a lot of responsibilities like life admin for the family, organising food and entertainment for their younger siblings (my older sister is actually great at this), and they say that makes them better leaders in their adult lives. Not to get too deep in the weeds now, but there was discussion in the office about eldest daughters becoming the carers for sick parents, especially if there are no other daughters in the family. Women typically carry the load when it comes to unpaid labour and care \u2013 is this trend just another unfair case of gender inequality? Hu says that in families following a patriarchal order, the eldest daughter often bears most of the burden from a young age. It can affect their wellbeing and \u201csteal\u201d their childhood when they are forced to assume adult responsibilities. It may also lead to a phenomenon known as parentification \u2013 where parents turn to children for support about their adult lives instead of being the providers of care. And this restarts the cycle of gender inequality in the next generation. I don\u2019t have a brother, but I\u2019d imagine that eldest male siblings are held to much different standard than the eldest daughter. In my South Asian family for example, if I had an older brother, I\u2019m certain that there\u2019d be much more emphasis from my parents on helping him succeed career-wise, while I would have to shoulder the burden of helping my mum around the house and caring for my parents as they age. Why do you think we are talking about this now? Because in its usual fashion, TikTok has given a new label to an age-old phenomenon \u2026 and because eldest daughters are flooding internet with their incessant complaining! I do feel especially sorry for people who are the first daughter, first niece and first granddaughter, like the woman in this TikTok (and my poor sister). What do the eldest daughters (or youngest daughters with eldest daughter syndrome) want from their siblings? Recognition? A \u201ccure\u201d? I think every eldest sibling (or those with eldest daughter syndrome) just wants their siblings to leave them alone. This TikTok of Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s exasperation at her brother, Robert, puts it best: \u201cWhat do you want, Robert? More money? A cheque? A car? My soul?\u201d As someone who is still an older sister to one sibling, I can totally relate.

Every one of Sarah Perry\u2019s novels has grappled lavishly with this question. Fate v free will; doubt v certainty; science v God. The metaphysical battleground is Perry\u2019s literary terrain. She cannot seem to escape its gravitational pull, nor the estuarine mud of her home county. And so it seems only fitting that the Essex author\u2019s new novel, Enlightenment, is a tale of orbits, collisions and other cosmic ellipses: inescapable loops. We begin in the winter of 1997 in the fictional riverside town of Aldleigh, a version of Chelmsford, where Perry grew up. This was a decisive year for Britain: the year of Tony Blair and the New Labour landslide, the handover of Hong Kong, and Princess Diana\u2019s funeral pageantry. But the only event that interests Perry is celestial: the blazing arrival of the Hale-Bopp comet. Enlightenment has its neck cricked upwards, its eyes full of moonlight. Our heroes are a gentleman stargazer, a master embroiderer and a wakeful ghost in a black satin gown. In both good and bad ways, Perry\u2019s novel reads like a collision between Wilkie Collins\u2019s The Woman in White, AS Byatt\u2019s Possession and the quantum physics of Carlo Rovelli (whom Perry extols in her acknowledgments). Enlightenment is gauzy and unhurried, a genteel novel of inner space. It\u2019s luxuriously \u2013 defiantly \u2013 old-fashioned. We follow the fate of Thomas Hart, a fiftysomething chap so interminably fusty he seems to \u201cshed dust as he walks\u201d. Thomas is a confirmed bachelor of the euphemistic sort, and an amateur astronomer (\u201ca citizen of the empire of the moon\u201d). He writes a weekly column for the local paper musing on faith, physics and the firmament, and spends his Sundays perched on the hard, narrow pews of Bethesda Baptist Church, a stern Calvinist sect, where he is told that his inner nature is \u201can affront to God\u201d. Thomas would leave Bethesda were it not for Grace Macauley, the pastor\u2019s wild-hearted, motherless daughter (our needlesmith in waiting). Grace is about to turn 18, and Thomas is determined to keep one foot in the chapel door to \u201clet a little of her spirit out, and a little of the world in\u201d. They are divided souls, torn between piety and desire. \u201cAll these years there have been two fires in me,\u201d Thomas laments, \u201cand neither puts the other out!\u201d Thomas and Grace see each other clearly, which gives them the power to protect one another, but also to inflict the deepest of wounds. Is it possible to love someone you can never forgive? It is hard not to talk about Perry\u2019s upbringing here \u2013 like Grace and Thomas, she was raised by Calvinist Baptists \u2013 but I\u2019m always wary about imposing causation. However Perry found her way to these pages, what matters to a reader is her imaginative brio, her unerring capacity to make the earthly new and strange. All the Perry hallmarks and talismans are here: jackdaws and night creatures, salt marsh and river silt, churchyards of cold stone and leatherbound books. Fans of Perry\u2019s breakout novel, The Essex Serpent, will be delighted. There are echoes, too, of John Fowles\u2019s The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman, with its ardent fossil hunters and high Victorian mimicry, though Perry\u2019s novel is far more decorous: a study in unrequitedness (star hunters look to the heavens, not down into the lusty muck). Perry has always produced gorgeous prose, and she has found a new, ethereal register in this book. Largely gone is the fire-and-brimstone gothic of 2018\u2019s Melmoth. In its place is something equally ferocious, but riven with starlight. Behold her description of Hale-Bopp: \u201cthe Great Comet of the age, radiant above the Lowlands pediment, and falling through Perseus like the last of the rebel angels\u201d. It\u2019s possible to forgive all manner of narrative sins for that kind of astonishment. As the comet streaks towards perihelion, the apex of its loop around the sun, Thomas and Grace find themselves caught up in a century-old mystery: the 1887 disappearance of Maria V\u0103duva, a Romanian comet hunter turned ornery ghost. They will spend the next three decades stumbling across clues \u2013 furtive letters, misplaced gravestones, a cryptic diary, a pearl-threaded dress \u2013 while Maria\u2019s \u201cblack-browed\u201d spirit berates them from the shadows. It\u2019s not the greatest of mystery plots \u2013 far too reliant on serendipity \u2013 but this is a book about the capriciousness of the stars. That is both its charm and its greatest weakness. Had Hale-Bopp appeared in a different decade, or century, I suspect Perry would have written exactly the same book. It\u2019s the comet that matters to her, not post-Thatcher politics.

It\u2019s a goofy summer crowd-pleaser (and you can never have too many of those) that is very far from the edgier and more satirical mien of Richard Rush\u2019s 1980 movie The Stunt Man, in which a Vietnam draft evader hides out on a movie location, doing dangerous stunts in return for anonymity. Actually, this one is loosely inspired by a 1980s TV show, also called The Fall Guy, about a stuntman with a parallel career as a bounty hunter \u2013 starring Lee Majors, a legend who puts in a tongue-in-cheek cameo here along with his co-star, Heather Thomas. Gosling plays seasoned stunt maestro Colt Seavers, utterly unafraid of any physical challenges, self-effacingly doubling for insufferably conceited star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who outrageously claims to do all his own stunts. Colt is having a passionate affair with beautiful, talented camera operator Jody Moreno (Blunt), but when he is involved in a catastrophic and career-ending failed stunt, he is overwhelmed with macho shame, thinking the accident was his fault because his infatuation with Jody made him take his eye off the ball. Colt self-pityingly disappears from view during physical rehab and cuts off all contact with Jody, who is deeply hurt. But then hard-faced producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham) persuades him to come back to work on Jody\u2019s first film as a director, a sci-fi epic starring Ryder as a space cowboy doing an awful sub-Matthew-McConaughey Texas accent. Gail claims that Jody herself wanted him \u2013 but she and the unspeakable Ryder have their own wicked plans in mind. Once the premise is established in the first quarter of an hour, the rest of the film is devoted to a long and essentially plotless extravaganza of crashes, bangs, jumps, punches and PAEs (Pointless Action Explosions). It\u2019s a movie whose own stunts \u2013 and the fact that stunt doubles are needed \u2013 lend a kind of metatextual frisson to this story, although the script does allude to the brave new AI world in which deepfakes can also be used to make it look as though the star is doing the dangerous stuff for real. Location footage over the final credit roll makes it glancingly clear that a number of actual stuntmen were needed, but falls short of giving these unsung heroes actual named-star status. Gosling and Blunt have a nice rapport: there is a sweet and apparently improvised moment when Jody\u2019s hat blows off in the wind from helicopter blades in the middle of a dialogue scene and she has to get it back in place. But this is more about the \u201cbang bang\u201d than the \u201ckiss kiss\u201d.

Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, made the announcement during a video message to staff on Thursday. It comes months after UK regulators confirmed they were formally scrapping EU rules that previously limited bonuses to twice an individual\u2019s base salary. UK lenders including HSBC, Barclays and NatWest are planning to follow suit. Gnodde said in the video that ending the UK cap would help level the playing field across its international workforce. \u201cWe are a global firm and to the extent possible we adopt a consistent global approach across everything we do. The bonus cap rules were an important factor preventing us from being consistent in the area of compensation.\u201d He said Goldman had advocated for changes that would give banks the flexibility of weighting payouts more heavily towards bonuses rather than fixed salaries. The move gives lenders more control over staff pay, depending on performance. It will also be easier to defer pay, and potentially claw back bonuses from bankers when things go wrong. The changes will apply to hundreds of Goldman\u2019s 6,000 UK staff \u2013 known as material risk takers \u2013 who will now be able to earn up to 25 times their salaries in bonuses. \u201cGoing forward, we will be aligning UK material risk takers\u2019 compensation mix more closely with the firm\u2019s global compensation principles \u2013 meaning lower fixed pay, but a higher proportion of discretionary compensation,\u201d Gnodde said. \u201cThis also reflects the prudential objective of our regulators,\u201d he added. The change will not apply to Goldman\u2019s EU-based bankers, and unlike UK regulators, American watchdogs do not require any guidance on maximum payouts. The bonus cap was originally part of changes introduced after the 2007-08 banking crash, and aimed to stamp out a bonus culture blamed for encouraging short-term profits over longer-term stability. The hope was that, with less of an individual\u2019s pay riding on performance, there would be a lower incentive for risky behaviour. However, they were opposed by some UK politicians as well as the Bank of England, who argued that the clampdown would make it harder to attract skilled bankers, who would instead flee to rival hubs in New York, Singapore or Zurich. The then chancellor, George Osborne, tried to overturn the measure at the European court of justice in 2014. Former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng then took advantage of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, and announced plans to scrap the cap in September 2022. The changes were later approved by his successor, Jeremy Hunt, with regulators formalising the change in November last year. Goldman said in a statement: \u201cThis approach gives us greater flexibility to manage fixed costs through the cycle and pay for performance.

In a downbeat assessment, the Paris-based thinktank also downgraded its forecast for UK growth this year to 0.4% from a November forecast of 0.7%. The UK will fall to the bottom of the G7 growth league in 2025, the OECD predicts, with growth of 1%, just behind Germany at 1.1%. US and Canada are forecast to be the fastest growing economies the G7 next year, both growing 1.8%. The OECD said Britain\u2019s growth rate would be dampened by persistent price rises in the services sector and shortages of skilled staff that will push back expected cuts in interest rates. The thinktank expects the Bank of England to delay the first cut in interest rates from 5.25% until the autumn after fears that prices growth could rebound. The assessment followed a more optimistic outlook for the global economy, which the OECD said was gaining in strength despite the threat of worsening conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. \u201cThere are some signs that the global outlook has started to brighten, even though growth remains modest,\u201d it said in a half-yearly health check. Global GDP growth is projected to be 3.1% in 2024, unchanged from 2023, before edging up at 3.2% in 2025 helped by stronger growth in household incomes and lower interest rates. IGrowth rates in France and Germany were also downgraded while the US economy has accelerated according to the OECD. Germany was expected to grow by 0.2% this year, down from last year\u2019s forecast of 0.6%, while France is expected to grow by 0.7%, down from the 0.8% predicted last November. A recovery is expected in the eurozone while growth moderates in the US, India and other emerging-market economies. Annual consumer price inflation in the G20 economies \u2013 which includes the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, France and Mexico \u2013 is projected to ease gradually, helped by fading cost pressures, declining to 3.6% in 2025 from 5.9% in 2024. \u201cBy the end of 2025, inflation is projected to be back on target in most major economies,\u201d the report said. Governments representing much of the world\u2019s output are expected to keep a tight rein on spending, even as interest rates begin to decline, allowing the effect of cheaper money rather than public spending to ease the cost of living crisis facing many low- and middle-income groups. In a warning to the UK government, the OECD said the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, \u201cshould remain prudent and focus on productivity-enhancing public investment\u201d. Any loosening of the public purse strings should happen only after interest rates have fallen back, it said, predicting that the Bank of England will reduce the cost of borrowing from 5.25% to 3.75% by the end of next year. \u201cFiscal prudence is required as inflation remains above target, and spending is to be directed towards supply enhancing investment, including infrastructure, the National Health Service, and adult skills,\u201d the report said. \u201cProceeding with the childcare reform will help tackle economic inactivity, but requires contingent planning to address potential bottlenecks, in particular likely staff shortages.\u201d Cuts to Whitehall budgets already in the pipeline would reduce the government\u2019s spending deficit from 4.6% this year to 3.5% next year, it added. Hunt said: \u201cThis forecast is not particularly surprising given our priority for the last year has been to tackle inflation with higher interest rates. \u201cBut now we are winning that war, growth matters which is why it is significant that last month the IMF predicted the UK will grow faster over the next six years than any European G7 country or Japan. To sustain that we need to stick to our plan \u2013 competitive taxes, a flexible labour market and far-reaching welfare reform.\u201d A bounce back in GDP during 2025 of 1% would be half that projected by the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

You have to need to know what happens next; and you have to feel like a bigger or better version of yourself at the end. Airport thrillers are almost always fun; much contemporary autofiction is just a stretch, largely because it\u2019s very hard for a book in which not much happens to be a page-turner. What a thrill, then, to come to Kaliane Bradley\u2019s debut, The Ministry of Time, a novel where things happen, lots of them, and all of them are exciting to read about and interesting to think about. Bradley\u2019s book is also serious, it must be said \u2013 or, at least, covers serious subjects. The British empire, murder, government corruption, the refugee crisis, climate change, the Cambodian genocide, Auschwitz, 9/11 and the fallibility of the human moral compass all fall squarely within Bradley\u2019s remit. Fortunately, however, these vast themes are handled deftly and in deference to character and plot. Billed as \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d, it is perhaps more cheering to think of it as 50% sci-fi thriller, and 50% romcom. The Ministry of Time is chiefly a love story between a disaffected civil servant working in a near-future London, and Commander Graham Gore, first lieutenant of Sir John Franklin\u2019s ill-fated expedition to the Arctic. Gore, last seen grimly walking across the ice in 1847, has been retrieved from the jaws of death by a 21st-century government hellbent on testing the limits of time travel. Gore is one of their \u201cexpats\u201d: people brought through time and subjected not just to a barrage of tests but the tumult of the 21st century (traffic lights, acknowledging the atrocities of the British empire, Instagram). The expats have some problems with \u201chereness and thereness\u201d: they don\u2019t register, necessarily, on an MRI scan or an airport scanner. What is a person? What is time? How can the answers to these questions further our geopolitical interests? Each expat has been assigned a \u201cbridge\u201d: part companion, part zookeeper, part researcher. The bridges share their homes, their lives \u2013 and perhaps more \u2013 but must file complete reports on every aspect of their new \u201cfriend\u201d to an increasingly sinister HQ. Ursula K Le Guin wrote that the job of sci-fi was \u201cto extrapolate imaginatively from current trends and events to a near-future that\u2019s half prediction, half satire\u201d. It is impossible to read The Ministry of Time and not feel that we are, in fact, mere years from \u201cnose-bleeder\u201d heatwaves, microchipped refugees and a government at war with itself. One test of good sci-fi is how quickly the central premise, however fantastic, becomes so obviously true to both character and reader that the plot is permitted to move itself without any further conscious suspension of disbelief. The space blasters, or whatever, must feel as real as the people; and the people must not be left behind in the author\u2019s quest to accurately describe (to quote Raymond Chandler) the poltexes and disintegrators and secondary timejectors. The Ministry of Time needs no such ritzy shortcuts: when the blue lights and lasers emerge, we have earned them. The test of a good romance novel is, in some ways, the same. Cliche is a feature, not a bug; readers expect a certain set of beats, played to a certain rhythm. Girl meets boy; boy and girl fall in love over one hot summer; complications (in this case, guns, governments and an age gap of 200 years) ensue. The couple must kiss; and, while a happy ending is not mandatory (luckily for Bradley), there must be some sense of hope. This is \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 a hopeful book. Much as our narrator would like us to believe chiefly in her failures, ultimately she exists around them and through them as a person in her own right. A nameless bureaucrat, through the course of the novel she (as she puts it of Gore) \u201cfills out with attributes like a daguerreotype developing\u201d. This is our hope, then, in the novel as in life: that people should become more than they thought they were. Life is worth living; and love is worth fighting for; and our characters \u2013 hereness and thereness notwithstanding \u2013 can and must do it. Won\u2019t they? Would you? These are the big questions, and Bradley smuggles them in, concealed amid a breakneck plot just as the time outlaws hide among suburban London streets. For, despite its vast scope, The Ministry of Time reads like a novel that was written for pleasure. The acknowledgments reveal that the story began life as a joke for a handful of friends \u2013 and while it is not always true that a joy to write is a joy to read, this is the kind of summer romp that also sparks real thought. While Bradley\u2019s writing can veer towards the glib, go with it: give in to the tide of this book, and let it pull you along. It\u2019s very smart; it\u2019s very silly; and the obvious fun never obscures completely the sheer, gorgeous, wild stretch of her ideas. \u2022 The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley is published by Sceptre (\u00a316.99).

Once I had removed the flesh, I was left with a natural scrubbing sponge, and enough seeds to share and grow again for future years.

It was given to MacGowan as a 60th birthday present by the singer-songwriter Glen Hansard. Clarke is devastated. Over the phone, she says it\u2019s hard enough living without the former Pogues frontman, who died last November aged 65 of pneumonia, but for the rifle to disappear has just added to her pain. She\u2019d like it returned ASAP \u2013 no questions asked. She only noticed it was missing on Wednesday, but she hasn\u2019t got a clue how long it\u2019s not been there. \u201cI looked everywhere, turned the place upside down and couldn\u2019t find it. So it has actually gone.\u201d Clarke asks me if I remember seeing it when I interviewed MacGowan at their house a couple of years ago. I don\u2019t, I say, but I\u2019m sure I would have if I\u2019d seen it. She says it was between the fireplace and the bookshelf and well camouflaged. \u201cI tend not to tidy up very much. I don\u2019t spring clean, which means that for ages I don\u2019t notice what\u2019s there and what\u2019s not.\u201d She sends me a photo of MacGowan in his famous green chair looking straight ahead, crucifix gleaming against his black top, rifle in hand ready to shoot. To be honest, when I see the picture I imagine myself on the other end of it. My interview with MacGowan wasn\u2019t the easiest. \u201cGod these questions are fucking \u2026 \u201d he said at one point. He never quite got the last words out, but odds on they weren\u2019t going to be \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cincredibly intelligent\u201d. Despite that, we got on well afterwards. The rifle, which was standard British army issue, is a Lee-Enfield 303 and has the name H Munn etched on it. During the Easter Rising, the GPO on O\u2019Connell St in Dublin was the headquarters of the Irish Volunteers who took it over and proclaimed the Irish Republic, holding out for a week before surrendering to the British forces. The gun was probably seized by the rebels and used on both sides. During the uprising 485 people were killed, more than half of them civilians. Sixteen of the rising\u2019s leaders were executed including Pearse and Connelly. The rifle is thought to be valued at about \u00a32,000-\u00a33,000, but the emotional value for Clarke is incalculable. \u201cThe thing about Shane is that he wasn\u2019t materialistic. The only things he ever bought really were records. He didn\u2019t have many possessions. He had his crucifix and rosary beads and statues of the Virgin Mary, other than that he didn\u2019t have possessions that were precious to him. But the gun meant so much to him. I wasn\u2019t entirely easy about having it in the house, but I definitely want it back. It\u2019s probably the grief, where any physical thing that has an attachment to your loved one you hold on to \u2013 because you want to hold on to them.\u201d \u2022 If you have any information about Shane MacGowan\u2019s gun, please contact the Guardian", "date": "2024-05-03", "section": "Music", "author": "Simon Hattenstone", "id": 221, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7941662e792a94189174fd1140dcc39340b4771f/0_177_1200_720/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Shrubs offer resilience and reliability: here are 10 that will thrive in your garden", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/03/10-shrubs-that-will-thrive-in-your-garden", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.055, "neu": 0.727, "pos": 0.218, "compound": 0.9989}, "body": "Somewhere along the line we have lost sight of the humble shrub. Its downfall could be in part attributed to our continuing love for prairie planting, which subverted the quaint cottage garden with its weighty perennials, swaying grasses, and broad brushstrokes of ribboned colour. Against such seasonal vibrancy \u2013 purple salvia, beaming echinacea and tall persicaria \u2013 stiff and woody viburnums, weigelas and hydrangeas came to feel decidedly pedestrian, the stuff of municipal car parks and stale suburbia. In appealing to this shift in tastes, many contemporary garden designers doubled down on herbaceous planting schemes, and our confidence in \u2013 and, seemingly, knowledge of \u2013 valuable ornamental shrubs began to wane. But under increasingly volatile weather patterns, our gardens are in desperate need of more dependable, deeper-rooted plant material, and the shrub \u2013 with its robust longevity \u2013 is ready for a rebrand. In his foreword to the newly published Shrouded in Light, which explores naturalistic shrubs, Prof Nigel Dunnett, who teaches planting design at the University of Sheffield, says the word \u201cshrub\u201d lacks a certain sexiness. Shrubs fell out of fashion through the overuse of a small number of common, unremarkable species, he says, but they are a vital element of truly resilient plantings. \u201cWe should take inspiration from how they grow in the wild,\u201d he says. \u201cOur landscapes want to be woody.\u201d Indeed, as current tastes progress towards plantings more acutely reflective of \u201cwild\u201d environments, shrubs present a loose, \u201cnaturalistic\u201d appeal, from the ground-covering habit of cistus and juniper to the informal structure of nandina and Fatsia polycarpa. The benefits of integrating more shrubby material into our gardens are many: they are easy to grow and demand little upkeep; their permanence provides habitat and refuge for wildlife (their fruits and flowers provide forage, also); they are versatile in shape, height and site suitability, bringing structure to deep shade and full sun. Shrubs are an ally, too, in the face of our warming climate, better able to weather drought and deluge. Moreover, as outlined in Shrouded in Light, they are effective against greenhouse gases through carbon sequestration \u2013 something too often associated solely with trees. So, it is time to refamiliarise yourself with the vast and varied world of shrubs, and find those best suited to your home patch. I have listed a favoured handful, ranging from evergreen to deciduous, flowering to purely foliage, and numbered from sunny down to shady conditions. Choosing plants appropriate for your soil and site is all the more crucial with shrubs (the other way lies legginess, stagnation, occasionally death), and my advice is always to plant small, rather than for immediate effect: you\u2019ll have better results and save copious watering. Play with placement \u2013 shrubs needn\u2019t be consigned to the back of the border \u2013 and good practice is to improve the planting hole with a little organic matter before soaking, planting, backfilling and firming your new plant in place. Prune to remove dead and decayed branches to reduce size and to sculpt and, generally speaking, do this after flowering (or a safe distance from frosts). You\u2019ll learn best from your mistakes: I left a trail of ungainly shapes in my wake as a beginner gardener, but nature straightens things out eventually; more important is to get stuck in. 10 useful shrubs (and where to buy them) Osmanthus x burkwoodii An oldie but a goodie, this large, dense and unfussy evergreen shrub ranks among the most reliable of all. In late winter, it sparkles with heavily scented blooms, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. bethchatto.co.uk Chasteberry (Vitex agnus-castus) I fell in love with the lilac blue-flowered chasteberry (or chaste tree), with its slender blooms somewhere between a buddleia and a salvia, when I saw it growing loose and free on hillsides in central Sardinia. Its leaves are deciduous, and its blooms are attractive to pollinators. burncoose.co.ukk Mahonia \u2018Soft Caress\u2019 When it comes to scent, mahonias are among the headiest \u2013 and earliest \u2013 shrubs to perfume the spring air. \u2018Soft Caress\u2019 throws in the added benefit of alluringly elegant, feathery foliage. One for a shady spot where other plants struggle. paramountplants.co.uk Blue juniper (Juniperus \u2018Grey Owl\u2019 ) How I adore this plant: tough, aromatic and gorgeously glaucous in colour. \u2018Grey Owl\u2019 has the prostrate, ground-covering tendencies typical of many junipers, yet rises to form a dynamic mound. Easy company beside Mediterranean-type species in full sun or part shade. paramountplants.co.uk Sweet box (Sarcococca ruscifolia) No list of high-performing shrubs would be complete without a sarcococca: plant them in little groupings, and their powerful spring perfume will stop you in your tracks. Deep evergreen foliage continues through summer. Try the award-winning ruscifolia cultivar \u2018Dragon Gate\u2019. burncoose.co.uk Tree lupin (Lupinus arboreus) A sun-loving Californian, the woody lupin has naturalised in parts of coastal England. Its shimmering evergreen leaves, lemon-yellow flowers and delightfully informal composition make it an excellent addition to a bright, free-draining border or gravel garden. victoriananursery.co.uk Fatsia polycarpa \u2018Green Fingers\u2019 With leaves that are more roughly textured than those of the better known Fatsia japonica, F. polycarpa forms a large thicket of stems that provide a green screen for foreground plants. The most shade-tolerant shrub on this list, it has large flowers that light up the gloom. bethchatto.co.uk Skimmia \u00d7 confusa \u2018Kew Green\u2019 Another old-timer, \u2018Kew Green\u2019 is the skimmia\u2019s premier cultivar, and is reliably durable in either deep or partial shade, and whether planted in a border or a window box. The prolific, nectar-rich acid-green flowers provide a soft natural canvas for larger plants. crocus.co.uk Thornless bramble (Rubus lineatus) This medium-sized rubus is an airy shrub that reaches well over a metre tall. Underused, its smooth palmate leaves \u2013 which emerge showing their bright creamy white undersides \u2013 are irresistible to the touch. crug-farm.co.uk Mountain holly (Olearia macrodonta) Olearia remains my go-to for adding evergreen structure into a sunny planting scheme. The blue-green, holly-like leaves are a perfect contrast to its dusky stems and abundantly clustered, brilliant white summer flowers. Prune every few years to keep in check. emeraldplants.co.uk", "date": "2024-05-03", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Matt Collins", "id": 222, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/816a119b347b1454f353b766091f61916e7ef465/0_40_4917_2950/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith announce stage version of Inside No 9", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/may/03/steve-pemberton-and-reece-shearsmith-announce-stage-version-of-inside-no-9", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.031, "neu": 0.718, "pos": 0.25, "compound": 0.9906}, "body": "As the ninth and final series of their BBC hit Inside No 9 begins this month, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith have announced a new stage version of the show for the West End next year.

As a hitchhiker in the 1960s and early 70s, I, like Bradt, experienced wholly positive interactions with those willing to offer a lift: interesting conversations over the course of a few miles, company over a shared meal in otherwise soulless service stations, occasional overnight hospitality with the driver\u2019s family, and even offers to set up my first lift of the next day with a \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d who was heading in my direction. This was all done on the basis of mutual trust, rightly flagged up by Bradt as integral to positive hitchhiking experiences. It was only after rereading Bradt\u2019s article that I appreciated that I had just completed a different type of hitchhiking journey through the NHS, where the key factors identified by Bradt had also played out: my having no idea who I would meet or where I might end up, the innate kindness of most human beings and the strength of mutual trust throughout the whole process. On the other hand, as a more realistic family member said: \u201cOK, Dad, maybe that was just the good drugs!\u201d Either way, hats off (and thumbs up) to Bradt as she continues her hitchhiking odyssey, and thanks for her help on my road to recovery. Phil Murray Linlithgow, West Lothian \u2022 What a joy Hilary Bradt\u2019s article was. So many memories. At 17, I set off with my sister and two LSE student friends to Greece. It was 1963. We had been inspired by Cliff Richard\u2019s Summer Holiday and The Guns of Navarone. It seemed easy until we got to the unmade roads of the Dalmatian coast at Zadar. We hitched a ride on a boat carrying concrete to Dubrovnik. We didn\u2019t know that bedbugs on board had led to the legs of my sister\u2019s friend swelling to twice their size. We had to get to Greece fast. After tortuous lifts in lorries over scary mountain passes we got to a train at Titograd, now Podgorica. It stopped at Skopje, which had suffered a terrible earthquake weeks before. The station was ruined, but we had burgers and beans on white tablecloths in a makeshift tent. We flew our swollen friend home from Thessaloniki before hitching back. Wenda Clenaghen London \u2022 Hilary Bradt is indeed not slowing down.

When asked for tips for selling unwanted clothing, Guardian readers suggest online marketplaces including Facebook, Vinted and eBay. But first, consider selling or giving to friends who might be the same size. Charities are also a great way to recycle fashion but readers suggests thinking beyond the local op shop to favour organisations that specialise in workwear for job hunters or even theatre schools who might looking to top up their costume supplies. No matter how you get rid of clothes, most readers agree that the sooner you do it the better, and that effectively cleaning every item before selling makes a huge difference. 1. Price clothes to sell No way do I want old clothes hanging around for as much as \u201ca year\u201d while I try to rehome them! By using eBay and Vinted, it\u2019s possible to reach a big audience and sell almost anything in a couple of weeks, so long as you price realistically. Where sellers go wrong is in assuming that an item\u2019s value now is defined by what they paid for it in the past (the \u201csunk cost fallacy\u201d). It isn\u2019t. Instead, if you want a piece to actually sell (and not just languish in a corner), the price has to reflect what a buyer is willing to pay for it. You must accept that you\u2019re not going to recoup the full purchase price \u2013 which is only fair: you\u2019ve worn and used the piece already. Even if it\u2019s new, you aren\u2019t offering the refunds or consumer rights of buying in a shop. Looking at prices for sold items from the same brand (as both eBay and Vinted let you do) will help you price realistically. For sought-after brands, 50% of the \u201cas new\u201d price may be possible \u2013 for mass-market high street brands, 20% to 30%. Low-quality fast fashion is vastly over-supplied and much won\u2019t sell at all. Perhaps you shouldn\u2019t buy so much of it, then \u2026 \u2013 Jay, London 2. Look to friends I have found success matchmaking, if you will, my clothes with friends and relatives. Even friends of friends. I inquire if someone has a young child, or is my size, likes a certain style of clothes \u2013 and I have found new owners for my castoffs. It helps to make sure that the item will be actually used and worn so match things to people that suit their habits, for example, machine washable items should go to lazy friends. A big help is learning to sew and knit. Which, once you bother to start, can open many avenues of usefulness. So many good clothes get thrown away because of one or two little snags, holes or stains. Even beginner can fix these with just a little time and effort. Also, for specific pieces like costumes or tricky-to-sell vintage clothes like cheap rabbit fur or well-worn gowns, try donating to independent theaters, school theater groups or costume shops. And for good-quality items like vintage dressing gowns, scarves or sweaters, consider donating to care homes or centers for elderly people, and even to museums. \u2013 Adrienne, California 3. Seek out specialist charities I have a set routine. Great pieces get offered to a couple of friends who are the same size and share similar minimalist styling. High-quality luxe brands I resell on Vestiaire which is also my go-to circular fashion site to buy from. Lightly worn workwear goes to Dress for Success. The balance of more casual brands worn and unworn (shame-faced emoji) goes washed and pressed to the Wayside Chapel, a local charity that raises money for people in need in my community. I used to shop there myself as a student so it\u2019s nice to stock the store these days. Nothing to landfill if I can help it. \u2013 Anonymous, Sydney 4. Keep clothes clean Look after them while they\u2019re yours! Treat your clothes as though you want to keep them forever, repair them when needed, keep them clean and stain-free. If you want them to go to a new home, be prepared to make a loss on what you bought them for. For me, the purpose of onselling clothes is to make sure they go to a loving home, declutter and then make some cash (it helps me come to terms with the money I sometimes waste on clothes!). And buy second hand \u2013 it\u2019s only a circular and sustainable market if you participate in all aspects of it! \u2013 Anonymous, Wellington", "date": "2024-05-03", "section": "Australia news", "author": "Guardian readers", "id": 225, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/14a1f267f6edd5ba3c165aee47b0e4f6986d4c54/0_0_6000_3600/500.jpg"}, {"title": "The Garrick Club needs women.

It\u2019s full of lively and fascinating people. The staff are superb, the food is great, the wine list divine. The library is to die for (or in), we have the finest theatrical portraiture in the world, sumptuous sitting rooms and chic bedrooms a wallet\u2019s throw from the Royal Opera House. Most of us think its atmosphere and ambience will only be enhanced when membership is opened to the half of the human race currently prohibited, otherwise known as women. The guardians of the Y- chromosome still resist. We\u2019ll vote (again) on Tuesday. My embarrassment is not just that it has been a decade since the last vote gave us a majority for women\u2019s membership (though not the two-thirds thought at that time to be required). It\u2019s also that I have to write this anonymously. Here\u2019s why. Not a notice leaves the Garrick\u2019s offices without ritually \u201cdeploring\u201d leaks to the press by \u201cunscrupulous\u201d members \u2013 as if this isn\u2019t a public issue! I\u2019m sure our inert and somnolent leadership would have continued to kick the can down the Charing Cross Road without media attention. And please don\u2019t give me the private-club or single-sex space defence \u2013 the Garrick draws its membership mainly from theatre and the arts, media, medicine, law and parliament. That is what makes it so interesting and fun. Much to its credit, it\u2019s a societal as well as social institution. My worry is that the club, as matters stand, considers interesting professional women to be clubbable only in the caveman sense. It shouldn\u2019t need saying, but society has changed a tad since the club was founded in 1831. Women have been permitted as guests since Harriet Harman\u2019s 2010 Equality Act. We\u2019d quite like them now, please, to be able to buy their rounds, drop in unaccompanied to shoot the breeze, to host tables at lunch, to contribute as club equals. In short, to be a normal part of Garrick life. Our new-Taliban members won\u2019t have it and that is, in turn, both funny and dark. The late, much-lamented Toby Jessel MP used to argue (satirically?) that the ladies would want their own lavatory on the ground floor. Another member recently told me that women \u201ccan\u2019t tell jokes\u201d, presumably the only reason Dorothy Parker was never elected. Another was recently heard to say he \u201cwouldn\u2019t shag\u201d a putative woman candidate. My friend assured him the feeling was almost certainly mutual (and, no, Laurence Fox isn\u2019t a member). I know what you\u2019re thinking. What woman would want to join a club with such hilarious locker-room bants? But that\u2019s my point: only women can dispel such residual misogyny by bringing to the Garrick a healthier mix. The antis, whose case can be summarised as \u201cwe\u2019ve always done it this way\u201d, will try to filibuster our resolution on Tuesday with wrecking amendments. They will make their final stand by demanding the obsolete supermajority. But if they succeed in further delay, they will be sued. And I wonder if they are aware that they\u2019ll separately and severally be liable for the costs of such legal action? There will be mass resignations \u2013 many lawyers I know will be sad to have to resign, followed by the arts crowd, led by the polymath Stephen Fry and Sting. The club will become as boring as anything in St James\u2019s. I hope it doesn\u2019t.

You spend a lot of time with wealthy and successful people. Do they have any common habits? Well, the most common attribute I\u2019ve registered is they were born at the right place at the right time. What I\u2019ve found is that the majority of people\u2019s success is not their fault. And I think something that plagues people, especially tech bros, is they conflate luck with talent. But across those who excel, the thing I have found is that if you want to be successful, you need to collect allies along the way. There\u2019s this cartoon of Monty Burns in The Simpsons, the guy who owns the power plant, who has no friends, who lights cigars with a hundred dollar bill. But what I have found is that really wealthy people are constantly put in rooms of opportunities, because from a young age they\u2019ve acquired allies. You say that when picking a vocation you shouldn\u2019t follow your passion. The people telling you to follow your passion are already rich.

When there are too many people in high-romance industries \u2013 fashion, sports, nightclubs, restaurants \u2013 consumers and companies don\u2019t have to pay you a lot. What I\u2019ve found is if you find something you\u2019re good at with a high employment rate, the accoutrements of mastery of that business \u2013 economic security, camaraderie, prestige \u2013 will make you passionate about that thing. Anything that provides security for your kids, your parents, and lets you do the incredible things that capitalist society affords will make you passionate about whatever that thing is. A lot of wealth has transferred and accumulated with older generations who have pulled up the drawbridge and aren\u2019t willing to change the system. Why should the young engage in a structure that\u2019s stacked against them? In the US we basically have seniors voting, and seniors who vote themselves more wealth. In the US, the two biggest tax deductions are mortgage interest and capital gains. Who owns homes and stocks? People my age. Who rents, who makes all of their money from current income? Young people. Even in Covid we flushed [paid out in stimulus] $5tn in the US, and 60% of payments to individuals were not spent. They were saved and used to pay down debt. Which sent housing prices skyrocketing. It sent stocks skyrocketing. Which is great if you own stocks and houses, if you\u2019re an incumbent. But if you\u2019re an entrant trying to buy a house or hoping some day to start buying stocks yourself, everything\u2019s too expensive. And even worse, we\u2019ve put it on the credit card of the young people. They will pay for it. It\u2019s just a transfer of wealth from the young to the old. Technology promised to democratise knowledge, make it simpler to build networks and start businesses. But it hasn\u2019t delivered. It\u2019s a double-edged sword, because 25-year-olds are watching [videos about the psychologist] Daniel Kahneman on TikTok. They have apps that round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and it immediately gets invested in a stock market tracker. And then if they do that, by the time they\u2019re 40, they\u2019re going to have a lot of money. So there\u2019s some amazing things about technology. They\u2019re also, though, fighting some real winds in their face. Technology is constantly trying to seduce you with the perfect offer at the perfect time to take all of your disposable income. And in addition, for the first time in history, a 30-year-old is making less money than his or her parents were at 30. So these kids are facing a godlike technology that soaks up every disposable dime they have, just when they\u2019re making less money. And the things they need to save and make money, like a house, and/or a degree, all of these things have skyrocketed in costs. So I think, actually, it\u2019s really tough for kids right now. Why do you think it seems to be young males who are more alienated and disfranchised? You\u2019ve said they are sequestered in their basements, living a no-risk simulation of life. You have a generation of men who are not going to college, don\u2019t have a male role model, feel shunned by women, and they become more prone to misogynistic content, more prone to nationalism, less inclined to believe in climate change. And some just become shitty citizens. Women are much better without the prospect of a romantic relationship. Women are much better at maintaining friend networks. And friends and relationships are not only important to your mental health, they\u2019re also great guardrails. You\u2019re just less inclined to make a really stupid decision when you have friends in your life. I relate to this because I think I was one of them when I was a young man. I didn\u2019t have a lot of economic or romantic prospects. If I\u2019d had Reddit and Discord and [cryptocurrency exchange platform] Coinbase and YouPorn and video games, I\u2019m not sure I would have gotten out of the house very much. And if you don\u2019t develop those skills, then at some point, when you\u2019re a 30-year-old who hasn\u2019t engaged in relationships or with the workplace, you become, I don\u2019t want to say unsave-able, but there\u2019s that [Benjamin Franklin] statement that a lot of men die at 25 but are not buried until they are 75. I think we have a lot of those young men walking around right now. You\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the UK recently. Our politicians always talk about aping the success of Silicon Valley, with projects such as Silicon Roundabout in London, or the Silicon Fen around Cambridge. Are these just kind of deluded visions? It\u2019s a really interesting question, because if you look at the AI boom, the biggest font of it was in the US, but the second biggest has been in the UK. There\u2019s been a ton of innovation and thought leadership around AI coming out of UK educational institutions, yet they haven\u2019t been able to really monetise it. And also, my impression of London is, there\u2019s not a lot of organic value creation, that the money is being made serving other people\u2019s wealth that was made elsewhere. The UK has all the underpinnings for the kind of economic growth you could register with tech, and yet Apple is worth more than the entire FTSE 100. So the honest answer is, I don\u2019t have an answer. Whenever I meet anyone who\u2019s rich in London, it\u2019s one of two things: they\u2019re serving other rich people, or they made their money somewhere else. On Pivot, the podcast you present with Kara Swisher, you spend a lot of time talking about Elon Musk. Will you always be talking a lot about Elon Musk? God, I hope not. We get a lot of criticism for covering him so much, and yet by far most downloaded segments are when we talk about Elon Musk. He\u2019s a brilliant man. But I\u2019m just sick of talking about him. I feel like a reporter in the 1990s talking about Monica Lewinsky. OK, we get it. Let\u2019s get on to something else. He\u2019s going to continue to be in the news for a lot of reasons. One is his personal behaviour. He can\u2019t seem to resist acting strange. Two, Tesla is going to go down in value, which will create a lot of headlines, and SpaceX and Starlink will go up in value. So yeah, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going anywhere. The Algebra of Wealth by Scott Galloway is published by Torva (\u00a322).

The Promoting Positive Behaviour Support Practice program is designed to help practitioners create safer, respectful, constructive plans to guide carers and support workers\u2019 responses to challenging behaviour. \u201cChallenging behaviour\u201d includes destructive acts, self-injury, aggression or any behaviour at a level of repetition or intensity that may place a person with disability at risk of harming themselves or others. \u201cThis behaviour is people with disability using the best means they have to try to communicate that something is not right for them,\u201d the University of Melbourne\u2019s Prof Keith McVilly, who worked on the project, said. \u201cThey\u2019re in pain, they\u2019re unwell \u2026 they\u2019re not being listened to, and we\u2019ve failed to provide the support they\u2019re looking for. These behaviours are a last resort.\u201d The disability royal commission heard harrowing stories about people subjected to restrictive practices. In the 2021-22 reporting period, 1.4m instances of unauthorised restrictive practices used against 8,830 NDIS participants and 5.58m instances of authorised use against 8,685 people. Restrictive practices can include confining a person to a room or physical space (known as seclusion), the use of a device to restrict a person\u2019s movement, physical restraint by another person or the use of medication. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The NDIS watchdog has identified the abysmal quality of most behaviour support plans \u2013 which are submitted to the commission as part of the regulatory process \u2013 as a key problem. The commission\u2019s 2022 audit found that more than 80% of the plans were either weak or underdeveloped, especially when it came to identifying positive or therapeutic ways to address the person with disability\u2019s needs, and nearly 70% of plans included no consultation with the person with disability at all. The new program allows behaviour support practitioners to upload segments of their draft plans into a tool \u2013 developed using natural language processing and machine learning models \u2013 that then analyses the plan and provides feedback. When bad practice or areas for improvement are identified, the program directs the practitioner back to specific components of the online educational resources. \u201cThe idea is they\u2019re being almost coached by the AI in conjunction with the educational resources, so that by the time they submit the plan it should be a functional or compliant plan,\u201d McVilly said. The program came out of a collaboration between the University of Melbourne, University of Queensland, and Flinders University, and was funded by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. It was developed partly as a response to the increased use of restrictive practices. Catherine McAlpine, the chief executive of Inclusion Australia, said people with disability \u201ctend to not know that they even have a behaviour support plan, let alone see them\u201d. \u201cThere can be a tendency for practitioners and providers to be more focused on the behaviour control rather than understanding of the context and factors that are driving the behaviour,\u201d she said. \u201cBehaviour support plans can end up being about fixing the behaviour, rather than fixing the drivers of that behaviour, or the problem that actually needs to be solved.\u201d McVilly agreed. \u201cGood science shows us [that] we\u2019ve got a huge possibility of reducing challenging behaviour if we just understand what it\u2019s about and can appropriately respond. It sounds simplistic, but it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s never done, or not as thoroughly as it should be done,\u201d he said. McAlpine said it was positive to see projects aimed at improving the quality and processes of developing behaviour support plans, but she had questions about the role the NDIS commission would play in ensuring they yielded material improvements for people with disability. \u201cWhat requirements might there be on practitioners in terms of improvement? What monitoring of a decrease in restricted practices will there be?\u201d McAlpine said. \u201cOur experience is that voluntary processes tend to result in good people doing better, which is great, but in others still not addressing fundamental issues, such as upholding people\u2019s human rights.\u201d A spokesperson for the NDIS commission said it was \u201ccommitted to improving the quality of specialist behaviour support\u201d. \u201cWe use a range of regulatory powers and functions as set out in the NDIS Act 2013 and Rules to raise the quality of behaviour support plans, promote the reduction of restrictive practices, and hold providers accountable where breaches of the NDIA Act and associated Rules are identified,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "date": "2024-05-04", "section": "Australia news", "author": "Stephanie Convery Inequality reporter", "id": 228, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0e28e03f0ac8040f14c055b5f1c127f66af2f0d4/0_0_6720_4032/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018I don\u2019t even dream about sex \u2026 I don\u2019t miss it at all\u2019: readers on why they chose celibacy", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/04/i-dont-even-dream-about-sex-i-dont-miss-it-at-all-readers-on-why-they-chose-celibacy", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.063, "neu": 0.643, "pos": 0.294, "compound": 0.9995}, "body": "Over the last few years more than 120 million posts have appeared on TikTok about the rise of an unexpected trend: self-imposed celibacy. While some predicted a post-pandemic era of \u201csexual licentiousness\u201d, readers from all walks of life and across generations told us that far from doubling down on hookup culture, they\u2019ve found refreshing clarity in a more austere approach to physical intimacy. While some readers\u2019 forays into sexual abstinence predated Covid, common threads remained. Whether readers had decided to apply the breaks for a few months or the rest of their lives, they all agreed that celibacy had been a positive experience that offered some welcome perspective on not only their relationship with sex, but with themselves. \u2018I didn\u2019t have sex with anyone but myself for eight months\u2019 I\u2019ve always been a people pleaser and during sex this instinct made me focus on my partners having a good time, which included faking orgasms. I still enjoyed the sex and was never an unwilling partner but I felt ashamed that I was being deceitful. And of course I also wanted to orgasm during sex, but until recently I\u2019d only ever orgasmed through masturbation. When my last relationship ended I promised myself that I wouldn\u2019t start another one or have sex with anyone until I\u2019d worked on building my confidence and sense of self-worth to the point that I could value my own pleasure as much as that of my partner. And it worked! I didn\u2019t have sex with anyone but myself for about eight months. When I returned to sex with a partner, I was able to be honest with them about what I wanted and orgasming during sex has become the norm. Celibacy gave me space to work on myself and break an unhelpful pattern and I\u2019m so glad I did it. Anonymous, Australia \u2018It is liberating to be free of old ideas about intimacy\u2019 I\u2019ve been celibate for a few years now and love this lifestyle. I\u2019m in my mid-50s and have found peace of mind, financial security and stress-free daily living from my choice. Staying solo (I don\u2019t use the term \u201csingle\u201d) is the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. After a divorce at 30 and a string of short-term relationships with men who were so immature, insecure and self-centred that I had to lose myself if I wanted the relationships to work, I came to realise that solo life was better on every level. My sexual needs are addressed and enjoyed alone and my emotional life has expanded and is cherished through long-term friendships and my family. I highly recommend this lifestyle for women tired of catering to men. It is liberating to be free of old ideas about intimacy and relationships and choose to live life on my terms of happiness. I plan on being celibate forever. Anonymous, Australia \u2018Celibacy affords absolute clarity of mind\u2019 My experience of celibacy was not so much a choice as a natural consequence of the intense Zen training I was undergoing at the time. I am an ordained Zen Buddhist monk in my 50s. I am also married with children. I have been through two periods of celibacy: once pre-monastically in India and that was six months\u2019 long. The second time was in the monastery and lasted just over a year. I have always been very sexual and I still am, perhaps even more so now as a consequence of my experiences. But at the time celibacy was a natural progression from desire to quite literally no desire. True celibacy in my opinion is the inability to even conceptually experience desire. From this place, one person interacts with another as simply human rather than an object of desire. When sexual thoughts are absent it is incredible to realise how much of our day-to-day life is usually taken up with conscious and subconscious sexual considerations and awareness. Celibacy affords absolute clarity of mind. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning My master\u2019s master once said: \u201cThe closest most people come to enlightenment is an orgasm.\u201d I now practise Tantra and as long as I remain in a sexual relationship, this bridges the gaps between my sexual relationship and spiritual needs. Venerable Daiju Zenji, Sydney \u2018I was using sex and my appearance as a way to validate myself\u2019 Nearly 10 years ago, a frank conversation with my best friend brought home some hard truths. With my best interests and safety at heart she told me she believed that after years in a nasty relationship that had chipped away at my self-esteem, I was using sex and my appearance as a way to validate myself. I decided to take a year off from sex and dating. The best thing was being able to separate who I am at my core from how I look or what others think of me. Getting back into dating after my celibacy ended was tough. It reminded me that there are a lot of duds out there that won\u2019t see or appreciate the inner work you\u2019ve done. Then I met my partner. I\u2019m glad I did the hard work when I did, because figuring out who I am and not seeking approval through sex has placed me well for a stable relationship. Anonymous, Australia \u2018Life is definitely less complicated\u2019 In the gay scene which is now dominated by dating apps, sex is primarily a commodity that is used to put notches on the bedhead. I just got sick of the merry-go-round where you have to have sex in order to meet someone. I\u2019ve been celibate for three years now and life is definitely less complicated. I\u2019ve found out that you don\u2019t need to use sex to fill the voids in your life. I got myself a dog two years ago, and it\u2019s awesome coming home to something alive in the house. Ian, Sydney \u2018I don\u2019t miss the sexual urges of my fertile years\u2019 Throughout my life I had the good fortune to enjoy sex without any detrimental physical or psychological interference that might have affected my desire to continue to stay sexually active. But now in my early 60s I\u2019ve been happily celibate for two decades. I have never worried about \u201cthe norm\u201d and for me at least, being sexually active, or not, is simply dictated by biology. Just as I don\u2019t miss my baby teeth, I don\u2019t miss the sexual urges of my fertile years. As a child I was aware that sex was something that older people seemed to be obsessed about, but I had no interest in it until I became a horny adolescent. Post menopause, I seem to have gone full circle back to feeling free of desire and seeing that sex is simply something younger people are interested in but holds no appeal to me. The desire to masturbate stopped, I don\u2019t even dream about sex. It\u2019s just gone and I don\u2019t miss it at all. I know many postmenopausal women are convinced to or wish to keep hormones at a level to ensure desire remains, but to me that is back-to-front thinking. Being celibate feels as natural to me now as it did when I was a child. Living alone and celibate feels like freedom and like my life was always leading to this point where I would be free of complying to anybody\u2019s needs but my own.

He spirals it through the air and, quick as ripping off a plaster, tears the creature in two. \u201cEven when he was curled up on the floor,\u201d the puppet designer says, undoing another of the dragon\u2019s joints, \u201che took up too much space.\u201d Oli\u00e9 sticks the body back together, a little shorter but more malleable now, and the tail wriggles back into being. Best known for his work on War Horse, Oli\u00e9 is holding a miniature prototype for Haku, a boy who transforms into an enormous serpentine dragon. Haku is one of the leading characters in Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s exquisite animation Spirited Away, which has been adapted into a major stage production. For the last four years, the creative team have been conjuring, tweaking and perfecting Miyazaki\u2019s world of gods and monsters in three dimensions. The full-sized dragon, for whom Oli\u00e9 took inspiration from fan art as well as close studies of the film, is now more than four metres long, with 4,000 hairs inserted individually down his spine, ears that pin back when he\u2019s scared, and a body powerful enough to carry a child on his back as he flies. Last year, the Tokyo stage run of Spirited Away sold out in just four minutes. Now, the Japanese-language production is bringing its spell-makers and shapeshifters to London. (By chance, the show emerged at a similar time to the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s staging of My Neighbour Totoro, Miyazaki\u2019s 1988 animation, which returns to London at the Gillian Lynne theatre next year) Performed in Japanese with English translation, its cast and their cohort of puppets are accompanied by a live orchestra who play Brad Haak\u2019s adaptation of Joe Hisaishi\u2019s original score. Working at an extravagant scale, the stage production is one of grand spectacle, minute detail and enormous heart. \u201cEvery 20 minutes there is something that, in any other play,\u201d Oli\u00e9 says proudly, \u201cwould be the finale.\u201d Oli\u00e9 was brought on board by director John Caird, who has long been a fan of Miyazaki\u2019s wild and beautiful animations. \u201cMy wife first introduced our children and me to the films and I was entranced,\u201d Caird says. \u201cI think Spirited Away is a work of genius.\u201d The director of Les Mis\u00e9rables alongside Trevor Nunn, Caird has spent many years creating large-scale opera and theatre in Japan, with his wife and Spirited Away\u2019s co-adapter, Maoko Imai, also serving as assistant to the director. \u201cI would not have been able to do it without her,\u201d he says simply. \u201cShe completes my sentences.\u201d Caird was brought up to believe in the grand importance of children\u2019s stories. He is insistent that Miyazaki\u2019s masterpiece should be seen on a par with Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and Peter Pan. \u201cLike them,\u201d he explains, \u201cit\u2019s an imaginary world that completely encapsulates its own rules of imagination. It\u2019s so great a children\u2019s story that it becomes equally enjoyable for adults.\u201d Start describing Spirited Away to someone who has never seen it and you\u2019ll quickly fall down a rabbit hole of munching stink monsters and radish spirits, of environmental ruination and humans who turn into pigs, not forgetting the playful susuwatari, or soot sprites, the helpful little creatures who carry coal on their backs. But at heart, Spirited Away is a story of change. It follows a girl, Chihiro, whose parents move with her to a new home, and who finds herself entangled in the events of a Japanese bathhouse frequented by gods. This is a collision of two great Japanese traditions. \u201cMiyazaki told me that watching documentaries about Japan\u2019s Shinto gods made him want to invent his own version of their off-duty lives,\u201d Caird smiles. The importance of bathing in Japanese culture was recently demonstrated when the touring production hit upon an issue, as the cast realised the apartments they were being put up in here in the UK had no baths, only showers. Unlike most Studio Ghibli films, the setting of Spirited Away is largely domestic, no matter how fantastical the guests and goings on. \u201cThe way I sold the idea to Miyazaki was to describe how I was imagining a huge bathhouse on stage,\u201d says Caird, who had to seek approval from the director and his team to stage the show. It was Jon Bausor, the designer responsible for The Grinning Man and the opening of the 2012 Paralympic Games, who dreamed up the idea of the bathhouse being a Noh stage, inspired by the architecture of the centuries-old classical Japanese performance style. Fully realised, a central wooden structure sits on a constantly shifting revolve, so that the stage never looks the same from one scene to the next. Colossal feats of imagination like this were basic requirements for staging such an expansive story. \u201cImmediately after he\u2019d said yes,\u201d Caird says of Miyazaki, \u201che added rather mischievously, \u2018But how \u2026 how on earth will you do it?\u2019\u201d \u201cAs simply as possible,\u201d answers Oli\u00e9. He pulls out a sketchbook and flips to a page where limbs and faces peer out in elegant watercolour. Some of the spirits have been realised exactly as he first drew them, while others took longer to find the right form; the largest version of Kaonashi, or No-Face, the lonely ghoul befriended by Chihiro, was initially an inflatable body that became too unruly onstage. He flips forward a few pages, where multiple shadowy bodies writhe under the big mooning face. \u201cOften the solutions we found were more elegant,\u201d Oli\u00e9 says, explaining how the idea of Kaonashi as a gobbling flashmob gradually solidified, each dancer ingested by the creature becoming a new part of its body. The film of Spirited Away, released in Japan in 2001 and the UK in 2003, was only recently usurped as the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time. It won the Oscar for best animated feature and is widely regarded as one of the best animated movies ever made. But when Mari Natsuki was first brought on to the film as a voice actor, she had no idea of the remarkable legacy it would have. \u201cI was sitting opposite Miyazaki and he looked at my face,\u201d Natsuki says, peering forward intensely, \u201cand he drew Yubaba. That\u2019s how my relationship started with Studio Ghibli.\u201d Natsuki\u2019s character Yubaba is the proprietor of the bathhouse, with her tough tasks for Chihiro forming much of the story\u2019s central drama. The actor initially saw Yubaba as cruel, but speaking to Miyazaki shifted her interpretation. \u201cHe said to me that Yubaba is like Toshio Suzuki,\u201d Studio Ghibli\u2019s dedicated producer. \u201cThey\u2019re just really hard-working.\u201d The lack of a pure villain is a defining feature of Ghibli animations. \u201cNobody is irredeemable,\u201d says Caird. Two decades on from voicing Yubaba and her twin sister Zeniba, Natsuki returned to play the same parts on stage. To physically become Yubaba, she uses a Japanese hair cap, a habutai, to keep her hair locked in beneath her wig, then layers on bright blue eyeshadow, a fake nose and wrinkles. \u201cThe same as kabuki theatre,\u201d Natsuki explains, referencing the heavily stylised Japanese artform. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be beautiful. It needs to be impressive.\u201d Seating almost 2,400 people, the Coliseum is London\u2019s largest theatre; in Japan, they performed to even larger audiences. \u201cIt takes overwhelming energy,\u201d Natsuki says, before grinning widely. \u201cBut it is a joy.\u201d Each leading role has multiple performers, a tradition Caird began in Japan with Les Mis\u00e9rables following a dispute between two actors eager to play the same role. The practice is now common, encouraging more fans to see the various A-list casts, and giving the actors more flexibility for their busy schedules. The initial rehearsal process for Spirited Away was, Caird says, \u201ca nightmare\u201d. It coincided with a Covid spike meaning the British and American sides of the production team were stuck across borders. Oli\u00e9 directed the puppets through a screen and the cast, crew and their translators muddled through until they were finally able to be together in person. The show may be helmed by a handful of British theatre-makers, but the team knows how critical having Japanese storytellers is to its authenticity. \u201cWe import so many shows to Japan,\u201d Caird sighs. \u201cVery little comes the other way, which is a shame.\u201d This is an opportunity to show off the brilliant Japanese cast and crew, he says. Natsuki adds how proud she is to be doing a Japanese-language show in London. \u201cI feel really lucky and privileged. It never happens on this scale at this length.\u201d Just like in the bathhouse, Natsuki enjoys how \u201ceverything in the show is done by manpower\u201d. All of the set and puppetry are handled by the show\u2019s ensemble, who wear khaki to fit in with the wood-coloured set; taking inspiration from the Japanese tradition of kabuki stagehands, they have gained the sweet nickname \u201ckhaki-bukis\u201d. Caird always knew that he didn\u2019t want to hide any of the stage mechanics. \u201cSeeing the strings for something that\u2019s flying is unmagical,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to be opening your hands to the audience all the time, saying: \u2018You can see how we\u2019re doing this, but you can still believe in it.\u2019\u201d Oli\u00e9 points up to a carved wooden figure slouched on a shelf in his studio, a Bunraku-inspired puppet. This requirement for total belief in each moving part in Spirited Away in part stems from his love of Bunraku, the 17th-century art form where a single puppet body is operated by three people, with full-bodied concentration. \u201cYou train on the puppet\u2019s feet for 20 years,\u201d Oli\u00e9 explains, \u201cthen if you\u2019re good enough, you move on to the head.\u201d The precision and clarity appeal deeply to him, although his team have worked rather faster on Spirited Away than the Bunraku timeline might allow; with associate puppetry director Sarah Wright and puppet co-designer Daisy Beattie, the team have created more than 60 impossible creatures for the show. They have worked hard to embed detail and rigour into each one\u2019s story and design. \u201cEven if something\u2019s only on stage for a little time, let it have an impact,\u201d Oli\u00e9 insists. \u201cLet the audience know what it\u2019s thinking, feeling, wants.\u201d As if in answer, there is a rustle behind him, and a soot sprite prototype, its body wiry and eyes large, tumbles out of a corner, seemingly of its own accord. Oli\u00e9 just shrugs and laughs. Live in Miyazaki\u2019s world for long enough and some elements of its magic are bound to spill out at the edges. \u2022 Spirited Away is at the London Coliseum to 24 August. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2024.

There are plenty you could guess: the Beatles, black cabs and crumpets; Pimm\u2019s, panto dames, pubs, the Sunday papers. Some more overarching ideas about ourselves haven\u2019t changed: the pervasive nostalgia behind the inclusion of country cottages, Georgian architecture, teatime and landscape painting is as heady as ever. The NHS being \u2018best seen as a triumph of devoted workers over the best efforts of Department of Health officials to screw it up\u2019 feels familiar; TV drama in the era of Boys from the Blackstuff and Brideshead was already \u2018something to be smug about\u2019 and The Archers was the \u2018voice of the middle classes\u2019. Others feel like a distant dream: what were \u2018flag days\u2019 (a charity collection of sorts) or a \u2018floral clock\u2019 (a horological themed municipal flowerbed, apparently)? Telephone boxes, the hovercraft, Woodbines and, sadly, libraries are virtually extinct.

Stranger still is the statement that Britain had the \u2018Capacity to create islands of excellence where talented or committed individuals can work with a sense of security, free from pressure for instant profit.\u2019 It\u2019s cheerier to focus on some of the pleasingly neat definitions: trains \u2013 definitely not something you would consider the best of Britain 40 years on \u2013 made the list with \u2018Puff-puffs may have gone but buff-buffs survive\u2019; the Cup Final got \u2018Sweet FA\u2019.

When she made A Beautiful Mind, the 2001 movie for which she won an Oscar for playing the wife of schizophrenic mathematician John Nash, the co-producer Brian Grazer was unnerved by her reserve. \u201cIt was hard for me to get to know her on the set because I\u2019m so emotional,\u201d he told a writer in 2001. \u201cShe\u2019s very serious. She\u2019s not silly. She doesn\u2019t have that buoyancy.\u201d It is a relief, then, to find Connelly to be thoughtful and lovely and erudite, happy enough to discuss her life and career. I ask if Grazer\u2019s description is one she\u2019d recognise. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that binary,\u201d she says now. \u201cFor sure, especially when I was younger, I was pretty quiet on set, and I can be quite shy, which I think could translate as potentially something other than what it is.\u201d The shyness is understandable for an actor who got her start in showbiz as a kid. She once confessed to a journalist interviewing her for the New York Times that she tended to act \u201cvery bland\u201d in interviews as a form of self-protection. She was a single mum at the time, so had plenty to protect. It can\u2019t have been easy to maintain her privacy, particularly when so much media coverage was focused on her beauty. \u201cThis whole pursuit is something that I feel like I kind of slid into, and didn\u2019t from the outset choose for myself, but that I found myself doing, and then sort of continued with,\u201d she says. Born in the Catskill mountains in New York, Connelly became a model at the age of 10, and made her movie debut at 14 in Sergio Leone\u2019s Once Upon a Time in America. On paper her teenage years \u2013 filming in Rome with Leone, co-starring with David Bowie in Labyrinth, and several cameos in Duran Duran videos \u2013 reads like a nostalgia trip on the BBC\u2019s I Love the 80s, but somewhere in that whirl was a young woman who was still figuring herself out. Not that she has regrets about the way life has played out. She has worked with various iconoclastic directors: Darren Aronofsky, Ang Lee, Todd Field and Dario Argento. Regrets would seem churlish. She has worked hard, and the effort has paid off. \u201cThis might sound trite but the truth is I feel so blessed with where I am,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd even the more uncomfortable chapters that might have been nice to have sidestepped or skipped over, are valuable in some way, and give me perspective to appreciate where I am now, and how things have turned out.\u201d Connelly leaves me to guess at the uncomfortable chapters, but she was devastated by the death of her father from cancer, in 2008, followed five years later by her mother. She has no siblings, making the loss all the more acute. \u201cI had been very, very close to my dad, and it was really hard to lose him that suddenly,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was living with us in Vermont when he died, and he had travelled a lot with us, and served as babysitter to our kids on various films. It was wonderful to have those experiences, but yeah \u2013 it was definitely an unresolved relationship for sure. He was quite young when he died.\u201d It\u2019s telling that Connelly has not been tempted to live in LA, a city I imagine too slick for a woman so grounded. She says she prefers Brooklyn because she likes to be in a city where she can walk the streets and encounter people. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not working, we\u2019re with our kids, we\u2019re walking to school, going to soccer matches, spending time in the country,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved being in nature, and in the mountains in particular, and crave it more and more as I get older. If I don\u2019t go outside, I get a little stir crazy. My kids and my husband joke that my favourite go-to line is, \u2018Let\u2019s go outside and move around a little.\u2019\u201d She and her husband, the British actor Paul Bettany, who she married in 2003 after meeting two years earlier on the set of A Beautiful Mind, have a second home in Vermont, where they spend time skiing and hiking and generally living what she calls \u201ca pretty simple kind of quiet life.\u201d Brooklyn was also where Connelly spent much of her childhood, attending the private Saint Ann\u2019s School in Brooklyn Heights, until her fledgling career began to take off. For a whole generation of late Gen X-ers, Connelly is best known for playing Sarah in the Goblin underworld of Jim Henson\u2019s Labyrinth, a movie that has only grown in cult status since its release. As for Bowie, \u201chis persona was so kind of elaborate and crafted and alien, but he just seemed kind of goofy,\u201d recalls Connelly. \u201cThere\u2019s something about how gracious he was, and how he was with me, which was so kind and gentle and comforting.\u201d She describes Bowie sitting on the camera dolly cracking jokes with the crew and running lines with her. \u201cI was really impressed by him, and how he behaved in that film. I\u2019d been a fan of his, but became a super-fan after that.\u201d Connelly and I are meeting to talk about Dark Matter, a new Apple TV series based on Blake Crouch\u2019s bestselling techno thriller. In it Connelly plays Daniela Dessen, the wife of physicist Jason Dessen, who is abducted by a version of himself from another dimension \u2013 it\u2019s complicated \u2013 and wakes to find himself in a parallel world. Lots of parallel worlds in fact. In every one is another version of Daniela, another version of their son, Jason, and probably another version of you, too. Each Daniela is the same, but materially different. In one she is an art superstar; in another, she is a single mum with a husband in jail. Finding his way back to the original Daniela is the objective that impels Dessen, and the show, forward. As we are told in episode two: \u201cThe multiverse is infinite; there is no end.\u201d Early in episode two of Dark Matter the camera lingers on a TS Eliot quote at the entrance to an art gallery, a kind of thesis for the show: \u201cFootfalls echo in the memory / Down the passage which we did not take / Towards the door we never opened / Into the rose-garden.\u201d (The same passage is the epigraph to the book). Are there passages Connelly did not take in her life, doors she never opened? \u201cOf course there are,\u201d she says. \u201cOf all the things that I go back and say, \u2018Oh, I wish I had done that,\u2019 I wish I\u2019d finished college [she started an English course at Yale, then moved to Stanford before dropping out to pursue acting]. I\u2019ve thought, in fits and starts, about going back.\u201d Occasionally she will find herself filling out an application form, only to abandon it, unsure what she wants to study. She is interested in American history, \u201cand how it informs where we are now\u201d, but she also flip-flops between science and medicine. \u201cI guess I stopped studying so young that I hadn\u2019t quite figured it out,\u201d she says. \u201cI was still at the point where I was interested in so many different things.\u201d But she is also aware that being an actor satisfies some of the desire to experience the lives of others. \u201cDoing what we do you get to peer into different worlds of these different characters, albeit in a kind of superficial, limited way,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of why I\u2019ve never followed through with college applications that I\u2019ve started.\u201d What keeps her up at night? She thinks for a moment, and says, \u201cOh gosh, sustainability. I just don\u2019t know whether we can get out of our own way in time to turn things around and change the course of the world.\u201d In 2006 she co-starred with Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou in Blood Diamond, a thriller set during the Sierra Leone civil war and an uncompromising indictment of the brutality of the diamond industry. Does she choose projects that complement her values? \u201cI choose things that I\u2019m interested in, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m compiling a manifesto,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that deliberate.\u201d Rigorous about preparation, Connelly approaches her roles with the obsessive diligence of a school swot, dissecting her scripts until she is confident she can fully inhabit her characters. When Bettany directed her as a homeless junkie in his 2014 directorial debut, Shelter, he compared working with his wife to taking a gravel shower. I ask, \u201cDoes that sound accurate?\u201d Connelly laughs. \u201cSure, yeah, definitely,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a really accurate description of working with me, and I\u2019ve inflicted it on so many people, not just my husband. I really do analyse things, I like to question everything, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s frustrating sometimes. But I find it really helpful in clarifying. I don\u2019t know if that makes things any better, but it\u2019s the way I\u2019ve come to do it for better or worse.\u201d Although Shelter was released to mixed reviews, Connelly says she\u2019d love to work with Bettany again, despite the challenges they faced on a small budget. \u201cI think it\u2019s no secret between Paul and I that there was a lot that he had to focus on and worry about, so when I was coming up to him with my scroll of long questions that I wanted to discuss, he was, like, \u2018Yeah, babe, whatever you want.\u2019 I was, like, \u2018What do you mean babe, whatever I want? Don\u2019t you want to talk about it? I had gone into it with this expectation that we would have all this time to just sit together and dream up things we could do. And of course the realities of making a movie with those kinds of constraints meant that it wasn\u2019t possible. Again, as it is with so many things in life, the only problem there was my expectation.\u201d Connelly is a brilliant, versatile actor, capable of rising above even the most underwritten role, deploying her emotional intelligence to give depth to the most outlandish plot. In her four-decade career, she has variously played a possessed ballerina (Etoile); a magazine editor in Pinochet\u2019s Chile (Of Love and Shadows); a Gotham-ish bar singer (Dark City); Jackson Pollock\u2019s lover, Ruth Kligman (Pollock); and, courtesy of Darren Aronofsky, both a heroin addict (Requiem for a Dream), and Naameh, the wife of Noah in the director\u2019s Old Testament update. Directors uniformly love her. In 1998, Aronofsky had low expectations when Connelly auditioned for Requiem for a Dream. \u201cI don\u2019t think her career was thriving for some reason, but she gave one of the best auditions I\u2019ve ever seen to this day,\u201d he told New York magazine in 2020. \u201cShe came in, and I was not expecting anything, and she left with the role.\u201d At the time, Connelly was still nursing her son, Kai, and would bring him with her on set. It was the most experimental film she had made. As preparation, Aronofsky would take her to watch drug addicts shooting up. It\u2019s the part of her work she says she finds most interesting \u2013 \u201cspending time with the story and thinking about who these people are and their psychologies and working in partnership with other people to create something.\u201d Just as she was reaching an age when Hollywood roles typically evaporate for women, TV came calling. She was 50 in 2020, when she was cast as the lead in TNT\u2019s thriller, Snowpiercer. That show recently wrapped a fourth season, freeing her to step into the shoes of Daniela Dessen. Blake Crouch, the series showrunner and screenwriter, as well as the author of the book on which it is based, recalls seeing Connelly\u2019s name on the list. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, man, that\u2019ll never happen, but wow, if we could get Jennifer for Daniela, we will be on our way,\u201d he says. Because of its length, Dark Matter rewards Connelly\u2019s nuanced performance by letting her character breathe and grow across its nine episodes. Although it unspools as a sci-fi with edge-of-your-seat twists and turns, Connelly is the moral compass around which the show\u2019s existential questions revolve. \u201cI know this is a show about the path not taken, but I was interested in a portrait of a marriage,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to show people navigating all these events that had taken place in their lives, the grief and the losses and the missed opportunities, and to show them on a journey to rediscover their commitment and partnership.\u201d Did her marriage to Bettany inform what she brought to her performance in Dark Matter? She thinks about the question a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to tell a story about myself or my marriage, but of course those are the most important relationships in my life \u2013 with my husband and with my children. That\u2019s so much a part of who I am. Obviously it\u2019s imaginative work being an actor, but the raw materials are our own emotions, which are forged by the experiences we have.\u201d Dark Matter premieres on Wednesday 8 May on Apple TV+", "date": "2024-05-05", "section": "Film", "author": "Aaron Hicklin", "id": 232, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d934f76bbdba8c2013b10903c64b34920298916d/0_1412_4480_2688/500.jpg"}, {"title": "I agree that Britain is a work in progress.

In 1966, as a 14-year-old, I arrived at Tilbury Docks on a cold foggy morning aboard the SS Himalaya. My father, on temporary assignment in the UK, was able to get me admission to Westminster City grammar, a five-minute walk from Buckingham Palace. I was the only Indian; the racism I faced was not vicious but muted, often manifested through jokes and accent mimicry. There is a certain advantage to being a minority of one versus a group. People are more accommodating. However, I still remember the first joke from school: \u201cDid you hear about the Indian who lived with a cow?\u201d \u201cReally, what about the smell?\u201d \u201cNo problem, the cow got used to it.\u201d Having never lived with a cow, I struggled to understand it at the time, but felt the peer pressure to join in the laughter anyway. Now, after spending most of my life abroad and residing between Bengaluru and London, I too perceive Britain as a work in progress, but experience it as well ahead of the other mature democracies in the west, at least in the context of diversity. Although I agree with Bose on the need to come to terms with the past, I dread to think how impractical it could turn out to be. We live in a world where not only do we have the online tools to confabulate the present, but also to instantly reframe our past. For those determined to edit the past with skewed narratives just to endorse their own agendas, this has now become a dangerous weapon of mass distortion.

They\u2019re each coupled up \u2013 in this case, sealed with a kiss from a total stranger \u2013 before staying together in a big group bedroom. As the days go on, new cast members enter the masseria. If they don\u2019t recouple in time, someone has to leave. When they\u2019re not taking part in challenges designed to reveal more about their interior lives, they\u2019re plopped around on bean bags gossiping. Sound familiar? Yes, BBC Three\u2019s I Kissed a Girl, presented by Dannii Minogue, is essentially the same premise as Love Island except \u2013 and this is the crucial bit \u2013 it\u2019s for queer women only. When my friends and I used to imagine what a \u201clesbian Love Island\u201d might look like, we used to joke \u2013 affectionately, excitedly \u2013 that it could easily spiral into chaos. Maybe they\u2019d become attached too quickly and never recouple, making the format redundant (a stereotype known as \u201cU-hauling\u201d). Maybe they\u2019d swap exes constantly (something we tend to do more than our straight counterparts, due to smaller dating pools). Or maybe they\u2019d never be sure if they were friends or lovers, lovers or friends, each caught in a cycle of grey area \u201cWhat are we?\u201d until the show wound to a close (another stereotype attached to young queers new to the dating scene). What we\u2019re presented with, however, is the sweetest, most touching reality TV dating to have hit UK screens in some time. The cast members, mainly in their early to mid-20s, are careful with each other, constantly communicating their feelings even when those feelings are new, uncomfortable or undesirable. \u201cI think it\u2019s nice that she told me, because she doesn\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d 23-year-old Demi tells the camera in the second episode, after being gently turned down. \u201cI do have a bit of insecurity regarding the fact that I haven\u2019t been with a lot of women \u2026 It can be really frustrating, and I shouldn\u2019t let that happen. I should be able to explore my queerness to the full extent that I want to, and not cage myself in.\u201d It is hard to pinpoint what makes the show so wildly different to its buffed up, heterosexual ITV counterpart \u2013 despite sharing such a similar format. Perhaps the lack of straight male contestants makes the show less of a breeding ground for misogynistic tropes (in 2022, Love Island drew 1,500 Ofcom complaints over alleged misogyny). There\u2019s no \u201cboy code\u201d, no shaming women for their \u201cbody count\u201d, no casual sexism. Even when contestants behave in ways that are messy, or less than ideal, as we all can, their actions never feel imbued with the nastiness that plagues Love Island in its lowest moments. \u201cIt worries me just a smidge,\u201d says one cast member when the person she\u2019s coupled with flirts with someone else, before the two of them discuss where they\u2019re at in a calm, face-to-face conversation. Maybe it feels a little simplistic to claim that the show\u2019s sweetness comes purely from a lack of straight male energy or heterosexual dynamics. These are young queer women, some of whom have only recently come out, some who live in small UK towns, who are now living in a whole house of queers of a similar age. You can feel the excitement; they\u2019re happy to be there, swapping coming-out stories and whether they\u2019re into butches or femmes or whether they\u2019re keen to try something new. When the first contestant leaves, she thanks the whole house: \u201cI feel a lot more secure in my sexuality, I don\u2019t feel confused, I don\u2019t feel shame, I got to meet a bunch of fit girls! I\u2019ve got a cool queer group. Honestly, I don\u2019t regret anything.\u201d I Kissed a Girl isn\u2019t completely saccharine or devoid of drama. There are spats, tears, moments of jealousy, contestants going behind other contestants\u2019 backs for a cheeky kiss on the terrace (yes, like Love Island, there is also a terrace), endless partner swaps and moments in which you want to shake some of these baby lesbians through the TV (you don\u2019t need to protect yourself so ferociously!).

Christopher Gilbert\u2019s family\u2019s pleas came after he nearly drowned on 14 April while at a lakefront restaurant by Lake D\u2019Arbonne in the northern Louisiana town of Farmerville. Speaking to the local news station KSLA, Gilbert\u2019s mother Yolanda George said: \u201cA friend of his called. She was hysterical, crying on the phone. She told me that Chris had [fallen] into the lake, and he had been underwater for 20 minutes or so.\u201d George said her son \u2013 an aspiring medical doctor \u2013 was rescued and taken to a nearby hospital. She added: \u201cThe doctor called us in and told me that at that time, he was brain-dead, pretty much, and the rest of his organs were starting to fail, and that we had 72 hours on\u201d life support, though Gilbert later regained consciousness and the ability to eat on his own. An attorney for Gilbert\u2019s family, Claudia Payne, told KSLA that the friend group initially told police that he had fallen into the lake. But further investigation, he said, found that a female friend had pushed him into the water. \u201cShe actually admitted to [Gilbert\u2019s] mom \u2013 as well as the police officers \u2013 that she pushed him into the lake,\u201d Payne said. \u201cIn the legal field, we categorize things the way we see fit, so of course they are saying horseplay. We are saying that it was a criminal intentional push into the lake.\u201d She added that one of the friends from the group attempted to pull Gilbert out, but it was ultimately a restaurant customer who rescued him. Describing her reaction upon seeing her son for the first time at the hospital, George said: \u201cI was devastated. I felt like my life had ended in that moment. \u201cMy son is aspiring to be a medical doctor \u2013 my son is going to be a medical doctor. He got his master\u2019s last year in biological science. He\u2019s preparing for medical school so for this to have happened to him \u2026 I was just devastated.\u201d George recalled the conversation she had with the friend who pushed Gilbert into the lake. She remembered asking, \u201cWhy would you push my son in the lake, knowing he couldn\u2019t swim?\u201d In response, the friend reportedly said: \u201cWell ma\u2019am, I didn\u2019t know that man couldn\u2019t swim.\u201d Gilbert replied: \u201cWho is \u2018that man?\u2019 This is supposed to be amongst a group of friends. Who is \u2018that man?\u2019 Chris? Everybody knows he can\u2019t swim. \u201cEven when we went to the restaurant, the owner of the restaurant even stated, \u2018Everybody knows Chris can\u2019t swim.\u2019 He\u2019s been coming here for two years. He\u2019s always joking about it.\u201d According to Payne, Gilbert\u2019s family wants police to arrest the person who allegedly pushed him into the lake. They are also seeking for the restaurant owner to be held liable for not keeping Chris safe as a patron of the establishment.

Hill played the unemployed character with the famous \u201cgizza job\u201d catchphrase in Alan Bleasdale\u2019s 1982 BBC series Boys from the Blackstuff. It helped launch a stellar career that included playing the captain of the Titanic in James Cameron\u2019s 1997 film and Th\u00e9oden, king of Rohan, in Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Hill\u2019s agent Lou Coulson said the actor died in the early hours of Sunday. One of the first to pay tribute on Sunday was the singer Barbara Dickson who worked with Hill in Willy Russell\u2019s 1974 stage musical John, Paul, George, Ringo \u2026 and Bert. Dickson said on X: \u201cA really marvellous actor. It was a privilege to have crossed paths with him. RIP Benny x.\u201d Hill played John Lennon in the musical, one of a number of Merseyside characters that the Manchester-born actor became famous for. None more so than Yosser Hughes, a jobless, desperate father of three who became an emblem of everything that was wrong in Thatcher\u2019s Britain. The character would pester and hector people saying: \u201cGizza job. Go on. Gizza job. I could do that,\u201d and when he wasn\u2019t head-butting people he was banging his own head against the wall, literally and metaphorically. The writer James Graham, who has adapted Boys from the Blackstuff for the stage, paid tribute, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to overstate the extent of the impact and legacy Bernard Hill, alongside Alan Bleasdale, created when they made Yosser Hughes. How rare it is that a character can so definitively come to represent an era, both for Liverpool but way beyond. \u201cYosser is often remembered as a head-butting brute, which he was. But Bernard\u2019s mesmerising and heart-breaking incarnation of a man being slowly broken, in his spirit and his mind, by the cruelty of the world around him, it\u2019s easy to forget how much heart there was there too.\u201dHill\u2019s performance gained him a nomination for a best television actor Bafta, losing out to Alec Guinness for Smiley\u2019s People. Bleasdale has described Hill\u2019s performance as Yosser as \u201cthe great, definitive performance of his generation\u201d. Hill was reunited with Willy Russell in the film Shirley Valentine, starring Pauline Collins, in which he played the title character\u2019s husband, Joe. He is posthumously back on British TV screens this weekend, playing Martin Freeman\u2019s dad in the BBC police series The Responder, set in Liverpool. Interviewed recently about his fondness for the city, Hill said: \u201cLiverpool is one of my favourite places, I\u2019ve got a great relationship with the city. I lived there for a long time and my daughter was born there so it\u2019s like my second home.\u201d Lindsay Salt, director of BBC Drama, paid tribute. \u201cBernard Hill blazed a trail across the screen, and his long-lasting career filled with iconic and remarkable roles is a testament to his incredible talent,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom Boys from the Blackstuff, to Wolf Hall, The Responder, and many more, we feel truly honoured to have worked with Bernard at the BBC. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this sad time.\u201d When Hollywood came knocking for Hill it led to roles that included Titanic, as well as the San Quentin prison warden Luther Plunkitt in Clint Eastwood\u2019s True Crime and the friendly inventor Philos opposite Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson, in The Scorpion King. Hill enjoyed the work but said he never wanted to join other British actors moving to Los Angeles. He will be best known to many people as Th\u00e9oden in the Lord of the Rings films. Asked about his experience filming in New Zealand Hill said: \u201cI loved every minute of every day that I was on Lord of the Rings.\u201d The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson remembered Hill as \u201cone of the funniest and quickest witted people we ever had the good fortune to work with. His performance as Th\u00e9oden, King of Rohan, is beloved by millions and stands testament to his brilliance as an actor. But we will remember him as a deeply loyal and loving friend.\u201d Hill had been due to be at Comic Con in Liverpool on Sunday. It said on X: \u201cWe\u2019re heartbroken to hear the news of Bernard Hill\u2019s passing. A great loss. Thinking of his family at this very sad time, and wishing them a lot of strength.\u201d His many television roles included playing David Blunkett in Channel 4\u2019s A Very Social Secretary, for which he was again nominated for a Bafta, this time missing out to Mark Rylance for The Government Inspector. In 2015, he played the Duke of Norfolk in the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall. Hill\u2019s theatre work included Macbeth at the Leicester Haymarket in 1985, Lopakhin in The Cherry Orchard in the West End in 1989 and Sir Chiffley Lockheart in Ben Elton\u2019s debut play Gasping at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 1990. Hill was born to working-class parents in 1944. After college in Rusholme he trained as a quantity surveyor but had dreams of being an actor. When he failed an audition for drama school he decided to train as a teacher but was encouraged to stick at drama by a part-time tutor he met at college \u2013 Mike Leigh. In 1973, Hill, in one of his earliest roles, appeared in Leigh\u2019s first TV drama Hard Labour as the son of a woman, played by Liz Smith, quietly enduring a life of grinding domestic work.", "date": "2024-05-05", "section": "Culture", "author": "Mark Brown", "id": 236, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a2853224ec70f392146ef7ca3ca4c59be5fa96df/385_272_3115_1869/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Europe\u2019s best beach holidays: Cadaqu\u00e9s, Spain", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/may/06/europes-best-beach-holidays-cadaques-spain", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.747, "pos": 0.22, "compound": 0.9962}, "body": "I have travelled all over Spain for both work and fun in the past two decades, but the Catalan seaside town of Cadaqu\u00e9s had somehow failed to register on my radar. Last year, my husband was working in Catalonia and when he had a few days off between jobs, I proposed an impromptu tryst. The brief: somewhere by the sea. I\u2019m a map optimist, which can result in disappointment. I\u2019ll spend hours tracing tantalising coastal roads, imagining wild cliffs or pristine sands dotted with charming fishing villages and chiringuitos. But the reality often fails to match my fantasies, and my dream road trip ends up leading me through Spain\u2019s more familiar coastal milieu of endless high-rise concrete and phoney Irish bars. Cadaqu\u00e9s, however, looked promising \u2013 a tiny dot on a Mediterranean cove at the end of a tortuous 10-mile mountain road, where the Pyrenees give way to the sea \u2013 and surrounded by pretty much nothing. So far, so good. Bearing in mind Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s maxim that it\u2019s better to travel hopefully than to arrive, I resolved to relish whatever the road threw at us \u2013 every breeze-block monstrosity and flashing neon cloverleaf. What I wasn\u2019t prepared for as we cruised the last few rollercoaster twists down to the sea, was utter perfection at every turn. Cadaqu\u00e9s is an aesthete\u2019s paradise: nothing jars the eye. Fiercely protected by a group of local artists in the 1950s, it has pulled off the rare feat of retaining its charm without becoming a Disneyfied caricature, or a fossilised museum piece. Nestled around a horseshoe bay, its labyrinth of cobbled streets and whitewashed houses tumble towards the sea, the bay illuminated by an incandescent light that reminds you just how far you are from Britain. It\u2019s this light that inspired Salvador Dal\u00ed to make his home in Cadaqu\u00e9s, describing it as \u201cwhere the real and sublime almost touch\u201d. Over the years many other artists came and fell under its spell, including Picasso, Mir\u00f3 and Duchamp, and the creative spirit permeates the town \u2013 best demonstrated by the way Cadaqu\u00e9s\u2019s residents use their electricity meter covers as artists\u2019 canvases. Dal\u00ed\u2019s house is now a museum, but we never got that far. With only a few days, it was simply enough to be alive in the radiant light, to wander down the headland among the pine trees, and bathe in the warm, clear waters of the bay. At night the town is in full swing, but in laid-back Catalan style. The action centres on the casino bar/cafe/gallery, a stately neoclassical building on the seafront originally set up as a mutual insurer, which now operates as a \u201cfriendship society\u201d, retaining a down-home community vibe behind its grand exterior. It\u2019s easy to see why Dal\u00ed called Cadaqu\u00e9s \u201cthe best place in the world\u201d. On our last morning, we lingered as long as possible. Our last act was a scramble down a cliff, past scarlet bougainvillaea and pungent rosemary, to strip off for one final dip, as if to absorb Cadaqu\u00e9s\u2019s magic into our pores and take it home with us. I\u2019m already planning to return.

Spring, however, doesn\u2019t always mean greens, so don\u2019t forget about first-harvest beetroot and carrots. \u201cWe don\u2019t always think of them as spring-like, but they are so tender,\u201d says Anna Shepherd, author of Love Vegetables. She finely shaves raw beetroot and uses it to top filo, ready-rolled puff or shortcrust pastry alongside shallots and pink peppercorns. \u201cLayer that with some plant-based creme fraiche and serve with a bit of cheese, just to give it an accent.\u201d A few peppery leaves on the side would also be very welcome. \u201cPeas are also underrated, and so good in a quiche with delicious bits of bacon,\u201d Coles says. May is, of course, asparagus time, which happily loves \u201canything eggy and rich in dairy\u201d, says Angela Clutton, author of Seasoning. The trick is to bump up the flavour, which Clutton does in a few ways: orange zest in the pastry; horseradish and dill in the custard; smoked trout with the asparagus. \u201cIt\u2019s also really important to char the asparagus before it goes anywhere near your quiche,\u201d she adds, not only to get that beautiful colour, but also to intensify the flavour. \u201cGarnish with pea shoots as soon as the quiche comes out of the oven, so they delicately sink into the surface, then, once it has cooled down, add a few fresh ones for prettiness.\u201d \u201cYou could also go down the gram flour route,\u201d Shepherd says. \u201cI love a farinata [chickpea pancake] with a medley of roast vegetables and the likes of such as cumin and rosemary.\u201d And be sure to leave it to rest for as long as possible, so it \u201ctakes on more flavour and gives that extra savoury dimension\u201d. Alternatively, she might get her grate on with a r\u00f6sti base. \u201cThat hits the savoury, crisp, crunchy profile, plus you\u2019re getting an extra portion of veg.\u201d Top that with a green olive and herb salsa, say, or a simple tomato sauce or some simply dressed sharp leaves (think rocket, mizuna or watercress) and a few parmesan shavings: \u201cThat makes a beautiful spring centrepiece.\u201d One of the greatest things about quiches and tarts is that they keep for days, though Clutton likes hers best when it\u2019s still got a \u201cbreath of the oven\u201d on it. \u201cBy all means make the quiche ahead of time, but do take it out of the fridge in plenty of time, so it\u2019s not cold, and ideally pop it in the oven again for a short while to give it a little zhoosh,\u201d she says. \u201cFridge-cold quiche is clearly a crime.\u201d Got a culinary dilemma?

The manicure was part of a coping strategy initiated in response to a bad review \u2013 \u201cseriously the worst review\u201d of her life, said Lamott. No matter that Somehow: Thoughts on Love, her 20th book, is cresting the New York Times\u2019 bestseller list \u2013 a dig by a prominent critic can still capsize her day. But this is Anne Lamott, known for her preternatural ability to uncover grace in all her trials, from the trivial to the existentially unmooring. Lamott has found Christ-like qualities in a colicky baby, self-love in the abyss of addiction, and even ways to shepherd her own neuroses when they arrive at the writing desk like damaged relatives \u201cwith their weird coppery breath\u201d. In this latest book, which reads as a collection of parables, themes of love and grace are often interchangeable. Lamott recalls, for instance, a friend who found a small frog in the shower, which she picked up and carried to its rightful place in the grass outside. The frog, panicking en route to safety, was insensible to the murmured comforts of its carrier. \u201cI think this is one of the best examples of how love operates when we are most afraid and doomed,\u201d writes Lamott, \u201ccarrying us to a safer place while we pound against cupped hands.\u201d The idea that we can entrust ourselves to such tender devotion \u2013 no matter how ill-fated our lives might seem \u2013 is a central thesis of Somehow. Through anecdotes about marriage, illness, best intentions, and penance for a misfired transphobic tweet in 2015, Lamott presents love variously as a vessel, a shelter, a meditation \u2013 and \u201cour only hope\u201d. And now, in the face of a bad review, Lamott is trying to exercise the wisdom she extols. She\u2019s leaning on her loved ones back home in Marin county, and drawing strength from the outpouring on social media, where fans remind her to shake it off. \u201cAnd then they said really horrible things about the reviewer and the review. And that, of course, was the best thing of all.\u201d I spoke with Lamott over Zoom. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Your book launched last month and the next day you celebrated your 70th birthday. Does that number carry any particular significance for you? Anne Lamott: It certainly sounds old. When I was younger, I really loved drugs and alcohol, and I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see 18. And then I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see 21. Then I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see 30. Then I got sober when I was 32 \u2013 almost 38 years ago \u2013 and I thought, oh, I\u2019ve reached the mountaintop. Then I had a kid and felt this urgency to try to stay alive, which I hadn\u2019t felt for a long time. Then I saw 50. But I loved my 60s. I felt at the height of my mental and spiritual and psychological wellness. As you get older, you just start throwing this stupid stuff off your airplane that kept you flying so low for so long. You just think, I don\u2019t have the time. I don\u2019t care any more. I don\u2019t care what my butt looks like. By my age, you\u2019ve seen so many people die, many of them younger. And so you get serious about understanding we\u2019re all on borrowed time, and that you\u2019ve got to make a decision about how you\u2019re going to live this one short, precious life. How does that realization change the stakes when it comes to love? Over the years, I have picked some really terrible but charming and well-known men. Sometimes attractive and sometimes not. Sometimes they were just good company and the world loved them. But I always secretly knew that if they were a woman, they wouldn\u2019t be my best girlfriend. They wouldn\u2019t even be a close girlfriend. And then when I was 62 I met this guy, Neal Allen. And just after one coffee with him, I realized that if he were a woman, he would be my best girlfriend. That\u2019s the value I held out for and that\u2019s what I encourage people who still long to find a soulmate to hold out for: it should be a person who you want to talk to for the rest of your life. A person whose commitment is to kindness and who has read every single book you\u2019ve ever read and loved and vice versa. In December, you wrote in the Washington Post about the slow descent of \u201cthe creaking elevators of age\u201d. Apart from death, what awaits you at the end of your ride? I imagine I will be surrounded by my husband and son and two friends. And they will have called hospice because we all do now. And the hospice is the calvary. They will come in with their syringes full of morphine, so I know I won\u2019t have any pain and I won\u2019t have any fear. I\u2019m a Sunday school teacher. I teach my kids that death is a pretty significant change of address. And I do believe that the soul is immortal. I don\u2019t know what that will translate into. [The spiritual teacher] Ram Dass said it\u2019s like taking off a pair of really tight shoes. I think I agree with that. There is so much money and attention being spent on longevity these days, which, I think, entails a certain denial of death. I was chatting a while back with people who work in end-of-life care, and their view was that our fear of death detracts from our ability to live a good life. There\u2019s an American way of forward thrust: you must always be moving and you must be moving higher in terms of recognition or acclaim or stature. I developed that toxic self-consciousness. It kept me from being here, breathing it all in and observing with a small degree of amusement and wonder and tenderness, because I was so fixated on what I looked like and how I was coming across and how I was doing. The forward thrust has to do with the fear of death, because if you keep moving very quickly, then you\u2019re going to outrun the abyss. The abyss isn\u2019t going to open at your feet and swallow you up. But everything I\u2019ve learned that\u2019s of any importance, I\u2019ve learned because the abyss opened up and swallowed me. Christians call it the dark night of the soul; an alcoholic will call it a bottom. And when you hit that bottom and you have to be in it for a little while, boy, you find out who you really are. Your parents were atheists. How did you come to Christianity? Well, it was really an accident, believe me. I\u2019d always studied God and different religious traditions and believed that there was something that heard me if I said hello quietly in the middle of the night. But I avoided Christianity like the plague. I feel about Christians the way everybody feels about Christians. I love what Gandhi said, that he loved Christ, but it was Christians he had a problem with, and that\u2019s totally how I feel about it. And then at the end of my drinking, there was this flea market near this tiny house where I was living. And I\u2019d go over there because when you\u2019re really hungover you want greasy food and strong coffee. And I could hear music wafting out of this ramshackle, cruddy looking church with a Charlie Brown Christmas tree outside of it. It was the music of the Weavers and Joan Baez and Pete Seeger that my parents had been very fond of. So I just started going over there because I loved the music. For me, one definition of grace is just running out of any more good ideas. So I get my greasy food and my strong coffee. I was bulimic at the time. I was hungover every single day, and I just went and sat down, and they didn\u2019t hassle me. They didn\u2019t try to get me to join them or to figure out anything or to take Bibles. They just got me water. They could see I was a really sad, damaged person. I always left before the sermon because it was just too ridiculous for words. And then one day I didn\u2019t, and I experienced saying to Jesus, kind of bitterly: \u201cOK, fine, you can come in.\u201d And I just tried that out, and it was really sweet. What role did that new faith play in your sobriety? I converted a year before I got sober. So I had a kind of gap year at church, where I was very smelly and weird and arrogant all at the same time. I had terrible self-esteem because of the way I was living and then I was very arrogant because I\u2019ve been raised to think that the Lamotts were better and more educated. I stayed there for a year and then I got sober. Church did not get me sober, but my deterioration did and I finally had no place to go. I would have died, I think. And so I just gave recovery a shot. You mentioned that you married your now husband Neal in your 60s. You\u2019ve had your share of loves and opportunities \u2013 what made you ready for Neal to enter your life? I was raised in the 1950s and early 1960s to understand that women take care of everybody else and that your value comes from being a flight attendant to everybody in the world. I also have a really warm and open heart and I like to take care of people, but my life force was entirely spent on my son and his little baby and the baby\u2019s mother and everybody around me. I was depleted. And one day, my older brother, who\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian, was staying with me and I said, \u201cI\u2019m just so isolated. I just am so empty right now. I\u2019m all used up.\u201d And he said some sort of happy Christian horseshit. I adore him, but it was like a bumper sticker and I was just furious. I got in the car and started driving and crying and pounding the steering wheel and telling my son and grandson and the baby mama and my parents and my brothers how much I hated and resented that they sucked me dry and how sad I was. Later, I came back to town and I called my mentor of 38 years, Horrible Bonnie (she\u2019s horrible because I can\u2019t get her to not love me). And I said, \u201cI\u2019m nobody\u2019s priority.\u201d And she said, \u201cOh, Annie, this is what we paid for.\u201d She said, \u201cYou\u2019re not anybody\u2019s priority because you\u2019re not your own. You\u2019re going to need to take a few months off to have to have a love affair with yourself. You\u2019re going to start with getting the overpriced tamales at the health food store and some flowers. And you\u2019re going to have to do that every day.\u201d And I was like, no, no, it\u2019s too California. I\u2019m not going to do that. But when all else fails, follow instructions. So I did it. And about three months later, I met Neal. There\u2019s a site called OurTime that\u2019s an offshoot of Match for older people. I met him and we had coffee and we\u2019ve never been apart. You\u2019ve talked about your own experience with addiction, and you\u2019ve been sober now for almost 38 years. But you also watched your son go through his own battles with addiction. What happened during that time? Oh, God, it was so awful. He\u2019s got almost 14 years clean and sober now, by the grace of God, but at about age 14, he started to get drunk and stoned a lot of the time. He got into meth and anything he could get his hands on and it was just terrifying. And I did what you do if you\u2019re a mother. I tried everything. I sent him off to the highest peak of the Allegheny mountains for three months, and then to an organic tofu farm. And when he came home he was dealing the next day. He got his girlfriend pregnant at 19, and they had the baby, and he just got worse and worse. Nothing I tried worked. Eventually, I left him in jail. The bail bondsman said, \u201cOh, my God, Ms Lamott, you\u2019re the first mother in my 20 year history as a bail bondsman who left her child in jail.\u201d And, you know, I\u2019m not positive he\u2019d still be alive if I hadn\u2019t. And then I said, \u201cYou can\u2019t come over. You can\u2019t be on the property wasted.\u201d And he stomped off. I didn\u2019t know when we\u2019d ever talk again. But then about 10 days later, he called to say that he had a week clean and sober. I imagine so many families in similar positions of watching their loved ones suffer would not be able to make those 10 days. They would capitulate to wanting to help. If you were to offer advice to those of us who are watching loved ones suffer, what would you say? I would say that help is the sunny side of control. There are these little acronyms in the recovery movement, and one of them is the five M\u2019s: We try to manage others. We martyr ourselves, we manipulate them, and we mother them and the entire world. And the fifth one is so awful: we monitor them, like I\u2019m an android or something, where I can monitor people\u2019s behavior and the number of drinks they\u2019re having or whether I can smell pot on them. I just learned to release him. Horrible Bonnie taught me this tool, which was to close my eyes and picture the person there and to push them away into the arms of their own destiny. I had to make peace with the fact that maybe I would lose [my son]. It wasn\u2019t anything but a nightmare. Either he would die driving drunk, or he\u2019d commit suicide or he\u2019d overdose. And I just had to release him. Somehow is your 20th book. At this point, is there anything that you feel you still urgently need to say? Not really. I wrote every single thing I know about writing, motherhood, grandmotherhood, mercy, faith, hope. My dream is not to publish any more. I hate publishing. I hate book tours. I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m a homebody. I like to be on the couch with the dog and the New Yorker or People magazine \u2013 either one will do. \u2022 In the US, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Such a project, though, was quite long in the gestation \u2013 Mamaine died before Bankes was born, in 1954, and Celia, who left her the trunk full of letters, in 2002 \u2013 and I wonder if this was because she worried just a little about the story she was to tell. The Paget twins were undoubtedly beautiful, spirited and clever. As debs, they were photographed by Madame Yevonde for Tatler; their circle included Laurie Lee, Decca Mitford and Simone de Beauvoir. But their principal fascination for the modern reader lies not with their own achievements, but with their private lives. As adorable and original as they appear in the pages of this rather delicious and sympathetic book, I have to admit that I sometimes rolled my eyes at their love affairs. Live alone and like it, I thought, as yet another heart was broken, yet another man insisted he could not possibly leave his wife. The Pagets were born in rural Suffolk in 1916, where they were brought up by their father and a doting nanny, their mother having died a week after their arrival. It was an idyllic, if isolated, childhood, one that instilled in both women a lifelong love of birds. But when they were 11, it came to a sudden and painful end: their father died, and the sisters were dispatched to Ibstock Place, the grand house of their rich maternal uncle, near Richmond, Surrey. Jacko, as this uncle was known, was eccentric and distant \u2013 not at all the kind of man to be interested in the desperate grief of two small girls \u2013 and they were sent to boarding school without a second thought. His French wife, Ging-Ging, was kinder, but her thoughts were all of the season, and of how Celia and Mamaine might find suitable husbands. In Yevonde\u2019s sumptuous portrait (the book is full of gorgeous photographs), Ging-Ging appears like a ship\u2019s mascot, gazing benignly on four girls \u2013 her own daughters, Wynnie and Anne, are also in the picture \u2013 who are about to set sail in their white dresses into a world of parties and balls and stuffy men with wraparound fortunes. But it was not to be. I can\u2019t work out where the Pagets\u2019 got their rather modern notions of freedom and independence (of a sort), but both were hell-bent on a different kind of life, and when they came into the money their father had left them, they set up home together in a studio house in Chelsea. When the war arrived in 1939, they worked as nurses, though by this point their story is already thronged with admirers. Sacheverell Sitwell, the writer and brother of Edith, had fallen for Celia \u2013 she refused him \u2013 and Mamaine had taken up with Dick Wyndham, a painter and (later) journalist from an aristocratic background who kept a pet alligator called Queen Maud. Wyndham, with whom Mamaine would live for years, on and off, seems to have opened many doors for the Pagets, through which they rushed, almost greedily, in search of fresh air. During the war, their friends included Cyril Connolly (later, Celia worked at Horizon, the magazine he edited) and William Walton; after it, Celia received declarations of love from Edmund Wilson, George Orwell, the philosopher AJ Ayer (with whom she had an affair), the celebrated barrister Jeremy Hutchinson (ditto) and Robert Conquest, while Mamaine took up with Arthur Koestler (eventually, she would marry him) and Albert Camus. If this sounds complicated and tempestuous, it was. But the reader will also be struck by the openness that is all around. Nothing is clandestine, and while jealousy may result in an almighty row (the men frequently cheat, and are also often in competition with one another), it rarely results in a separation, let alone in the end of a friendship. The twins have a gift for the latter, as well as for managing male egos. Bankes is a fond biographer. She makes no judgments, and is beguiled by Celia and Mamaine\u2019s near-telepathic closeness. She remembers how she noticed as a girl her mother\u2019s moments of melancholy: a distracted sadness born of the loss of her sister, who died following a severe asthma attack (Bankes\u2019s father was a diplomat, Arthur Goodman, whom Celia married just as Mamaine fell ill). But for the reader, the pleasure of The Quality of Love lies in the details, in the sometimes startling small print of the sisters\u2019 relationships. Here is Camus, correcting the proofs of La Peste (The Plague) as he waits for Mamaine to arrive; and here is Orwell, inviting Celia over to his cold, drab flat in Islington, to watch him changing the nappies of his baby son, Richard. Bankes struggles, I think, to make the moody, hard-drinking Koestler likable \u2013 on his wedding night to Mamaine, he gets so smashed, she ends up spending it (chastely) with Stephen Spender \u2013 but all her characters are sketched so effortlessly; you see them, and you even smell them (Orwell reeks of sardines). I wasn\u2019t surprised when, at one point, Mamaine wrote to Edmund Wilson to insist that, no, she did not have a classical beau (he was suspicious of her reasons for taking up Ancient Greek); but if I often thought these two women were too much under the spell of their Great Men, there wasn\u2019t a moment when I didn\u2019t relish being in their company. Their appetites, their energy, the pleasure they take in absolutely everything: such things are a tonic, the perfect antidote to a certain kind of 21st century puritanism. \u2022 The Quality of Love: Twin Sisters at the Heart of the Century by Ariane Bankes is published by Duckworth (\u00a320).

Body-image problems can seriously affect a person\u2019s libido. If your wife can be helped to feel attractive again, her libido will rise. Practise positive reinforcement: compliment her often about the way she looks, especially in non-sexual contexts. Regarding her planning of sex, many people would love to have more spontaneous sex, but find that reality tends to interfere. Scheduling sex is a very good idea for busy, stressed people and it is your wife\u2019s way of initiating lovemaking.

The Soil Association is trying to get a nationwide picture of worm abundance, to track their decline and see where they need the most help. Across May, the charity is asking people to dance on the soil, soak the earth with water or use the vibrations of a garden fork to draw worms up. Using the data collected, specialists will create a worm map of the UK to show where the healthiest and most biodiverse soil is. Soil that is full of worms is an indicator that it is healthy. Worms are vital for the soil; they produce a sticky mucus that binds it together, and this helps to alleviate flooding. Soil with worms is up to 90% more effective at soaking up water. However, due to pesticides, excessive draining and the use of inorganic fertilisers, the worm population appears to have shrunk. A recent study found that earthworm populations had declined by a third over the past 25 years. The Soil Association\u2019s head of worms, Alex Burton, said: \u201cIt might sound wacky but dancing on the bare earth can help with science. Worm charming is fun and a little surreal, but scientists and farmers use worm counts to understand soil health. We depend on soils for 95% of our food production, and they hold more carbon than the atmosphere, so it is crucial for us to know what\u2019s going on under the ground and worms help to tell us that. \u201cThe data we get for the worm map will help us build a better understanding of the health of soils in gardens, allotments and green spaces across the UK. This will show where they need help to restore their numbers. Worms are in our news, films and our gardens, where children love uncovering them. We\u2019re calling for people to become citizen scientists for our valuable pals, and if they don\u2019t find as many as they were expecting, we have plenty of advice to help them improve the soil.\u201d The charity is working with the Falmouth worm charming championships, which will be handing out awards for the most worms charmed and the most creative ways of seducing them from the deep.

(Though I assure you there are less ridiculous ways to get started with edible plants.) After my epiphany brought me back to London, I had to figure out how to grow without a garden (as even my windowsills were too narrow for a window box), so I spent my spare time volunteering in community gardens and city farms, starting to learn what it takes to sow, grow and harvest. I found that all the growers I lent a hand to would repay my efforts by sharing with me their insight and experience as we harvested, weeded and mulched together. Whether it\u2019s someone up the street whose crops catch your eye or your allotment neighbour with an enviable plot, it\u2019s especially useful to get advice from nearby gardeners who can tell you what does \u2013 and doesn\u2019t \u2013 do well where you are. Despite having a horticultural qualification now, I truly believe the most enriching kind of learning I\u2019ve experienced has been by the side of passionate plant people. Volunteering, though, is the preserve of those with the privilege of free time, which so many of us don\u2019t have enough of. When I was too busy working to volunteer, I\u2019d be making my way through the secondhand gardening books I\u2019d collected from charity shops. While there are new books about growing released every year, most old ones contain the same information and are, of course, more affordable. I\u2019d take an abundance of notes and then return the book to the charity shop for the next budding grower to find. I got started in growing before lots of gardeners had taken to demonstrating their skills on social media. If there had been how-to videos and garden tours on my phone, that\u2019s how I would have be learning. So if you\u2019re also more of a visual learner, I recommend that you check out Rekha Mistry and Huw Richards (instagram.com/huwsgarden). Both offer great practical advice that takes you through the process of cultivating all sort of plants destined to end up on your plate. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a sunny patch to call your own but feel a bit daunted by the prospect of growing into soil, consider starting with containers (I really like fabric grow bags and use plenty of them every season).

But they have abdicated that moral authority,\u201d which is why Colbert declared, with the power vested in a late-night host, that the court was unconstitutional. \u201cI don\u2019t make this decision lightly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m here to say that their decisions are \u2026 henceforth null and void, because they are poo-poo heads and completely divorced from what the people want and reality.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers celebrated a New York court\u2019s rejection of Trump\u2019s request to extend the payment period for his civil fraud penalty; as of now, he must either pay $454m or present a cash bond within 30 days. \u201cA lot of batshit stuff will happen in this election, so I think it\u2019s OK for us to just take a second and enjoy the sentence \u2018Trump doesn\u2019t have the money,\u2019\u201d Meyers laughed. Trump will probably have to sell off property to raise the money. \u201cI guess that means we should look forward to seeing his private jet joining the Spirit Airlines fleet,\u201d Meyers quipped. \u201cIf you upgrade to Comfort Plus, you get exclusive access to the gold toilet.\u201d Meyers also touched on the supreme court\u2019s decision to hear Trump\u2019s immunity defense. \u201cThe supreme court is a partisan institution that is there to protect Trump and do his bidding,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich of course undercuts the supreme court\u2019s self-styled image as an independent arbiter of the law. \u201cThe justices want to be seen as apolitical, but there can be no doubt now that they\u2019re very explicitly doing Trump\u2019s bidding after siding with him in his attempt to get his January 6 trial delayed until after the election,\u201d he added. \u201cKeep in mind, this isn\u2019t some sort of thorny, hotly contested constitutional issue that\u2019s been vexing scholars for decades, and where the lower courts are at loggerheads, thus forcing the high court to step in to reconcile contradictory rulings,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBasically everyone thinks this is ridiculous. Trump is saying: \u2018I\u2019m allowed to commit any crime I want, and nobody can do anything about it,\u2019 and the supreme court is like, \u2018Oh, yeah, maybe we\u2019ll take a look at that.\u2019\u201d Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped Trump\u2019s visit to the southern border \u201cto scream about Biden not doing anything to secure the border\u201d after strong-arming Republicans to renege on a deal that they made with Democrats to improve border security. Polls now show about half of Americans support construction of a wall along the border, \u201cwhich is just as dumb an idea as when Trump first threw it out there eight years ago,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cFirst of all, there already is a wall across the parts of the border where a wall makes sense. There\u2019s 706 miles of wall already. And second, walls \u2013 they\u2019re not magic. You can go over them, you can go under them, you can cut right through \u2013 basically, a wall is a great way to stop undocumented bighorn sheep from sneaking in here and taking jobs from American sheep.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump is looking for money for his fraud penalty of $454m or a bond to cover it. \u201cIn other words, a man who became famous for never paying anyone back has to convince a bonding company that he will definitely pay them back, and it\u2019s not happening,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cHe owes like a whole Powerball lottery jackpot\u201d and he may have to sell off property to reach it. \u201cBut that\u2019s a worst-case scenario,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cHis first move is to see how much he can get for Eric on Craigslist.\u201d", "date": "2024-03-01", "section": "Culture", "author": "Guardian staff", "id": 246, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/532213b187752b1b2004a056c265bee155428b2a/107_122_2538_1523/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Winchester plan for \u00a3100,000 Jane Austen statue triggers \u2018Disneyfication\u2019 fears", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/01/winchester-cathedral-jane-austen-statue-disneyfication", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.035, "neu": 0.731, "pos": 0.234, "compound": 0.9929}, "body": "The idea was to celebrate one of the greatest British authors with a beautiful statue set up in a cathedral for the 250th anniversary of their birth. But at a public meeting to discuss the erection of a Jane Austen sculpture close to her final resting place at Winchester Cathedral, concerns were raised that it would lead to the \u201cDisneyfication\u201d of the place of worship and become a magnet for tourists keen to get a selfie. Elizabeth Proudman, an Austen expert and leading light in the Jane Austen Society, also suggested the author herself would not have approved of the statue and the fuss surrounding it. She said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what she looked like, but we do know that she was a very private person. She despised publicity.\u201d Austen is buried in the north nave aisle of Winchester Cathedral under a memorial stone, which mentions \u201cthe extraordinary endowments of her mind\u201d but does not provide any more detail about her career. The Hampshire cathedral says the anniversary \u201cpresents a significant opportunity to bring her legacy to even greater prominence\u201d and plans to erect the statue in the Inner Close. Proudman said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any statue is appropriate for this part of Winchester Cathedral. The Inner Close is where the monks had a private area, it\u2019s a special place. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to turn it into Disneyland-on-Itchen [the river that runs through the city]. I don\u2019t think the Inner Close is the place to attract a lot of American tourists to come and have a selfie with Jane Austen.\u201d The \u00a3100,000 statue is being created by the sculptor Martin Jennings, who created the official coin effigy of King Charles. His Austen statue, which he is still working on, captures her standing next to her writing desk, prompting Lizzie Dunford, the director of Jane Austen\u2019s House in Chawton, Hampshire, to question why she had not been depicted actually writing. After unveiling his preliminary model, Jennings said: \u201cThis is a work of the imagination as, I must emphasise, every work of art is. We don\u2019t know very much at all about what she looked like. I want the sculpture to express her spirit. \u201cIn life, she may have been aghast at being represented in this way. But after death, she belongs to all of us. I don\u2019t think we have, in any way, invaded her private personality. If she was writing, her head would be bent over and looking down. The figure is more dynamic.\u201d The Rev Canon Dr Roland Riem, the vice-dean of the cathedral, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t designed by committee.

After the voting window for the Academy Awards closed on Tuesday, the intervening period before the results are announced on Sunday week is filled with fevered speculation. Much of the fuel is provided by anonymised interviews with Oscar voters, known as the Brutally Honest Oscar Ballots, in which real-life Academy members talk through how they arrived at their particular choices, and in doing so shed much light on how individual films and performers benefit or are disadvantaged in the process. The brainchild of Hollywood Reporter columnist Scott Feinberg, the Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot is in fact contrary to Academy regulations, which bars \u201cshar[ing] your voting decisions at any point \u2026 includ[ing] speaking with press anonymously\u201d. But it has been a fixture for more than a decade, with revelations including the studio executive who said he never got around to seeing Mad Max: Fury Road and the actor who proclaimed she was \u201cjust sick of\u201d Meryl Streep. And the verdict on the 2024 crop is that The Zone of Interest is making an unexpectedly strong challenge for the Oscars headline award. Since its five-award victory at the Golden Globes, and the subsequent announcement of its status as Oscars nominations leader, the received wisdom is that Oppenheimer, the Christopher Nolan-directed biopic of atomic weapon scientist J Robert Oppenheimer, is the most likely winner of the best picture prize and is far ahead in the bookies\u2019 ratings. The vote-transfer system used by the Oscars is still expected to deliver a victory for Oppenheimer. However, enthusiastic endorsements from unnamed voters are a sign that The Zone of Interest should be taken seriously as a player in the race. The Academy voter interviewed in the Hollywood Reporter described it as \u201cwhat film-making is supposed to do\u201d, and said he had voted for it over Oppenheimer, while Variety magazine, which is also conducting its own anonymous interviews, said that two out of its five interviewees named The Zone of Interest as their choice for best picture \u2013 the same amount as for Oppenheimer \u2013 with one participant saying it \u201chaunted me ever since I saw it\u201d. With its largely German dialogue, The Zone of Interest is also nominated for the best international feature film Oscar, where it is the strong favourite to defeat the likes of air-crash drama Society of the Snow (selected by Spain) and toilet-cleaner character study Perfect Days (selected by Japan). The Zone of Interest\u2019s chances in this category were considerably improved after Cannes winner Anatomy of a Fall, its main non-English-language rival on the awards circuit, was not put forward for the international feature Oscar by its home country France, who opted for foodie romance The Taste of Things instead. However, the dynamic between The Zone of Interest and Anatomy of a Fall is expected to find an echo in the fortunes of Sandra H\u00fcller, who is nominated for best actress for her role in the latter, as a woman on trial for her husband\u2019s death; she also features in the former as Hedwig H\u00f6ss, wife of Auschwitz camp commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss (played by Christian Friedel), but for which H\u00fcller did not receive a supporting actress nomination. The weight of both performances saw H\u00fcller named by the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Brutally Honest voter for best actress, in a category considered hitherto as a contest between Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon and Emma Stone for Poor Things, and by two of Variety\u2019s five anonymous interviewees. Given the tiny sample size, the views of the Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot does not make for a conclusive poll, but it is indicative that the race is far from done and dusted.

The thrilling story of ninja translators is yet to be told, but Jennifer Croft, an eminent translator whose English version of Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s Flights won the International Booker prize in 2018, has put her own spin on the profession with this ambitious, fecund novel, her second after the autofictional Homesick (published in Spanish in 2014, then in English in 2019). Croft has been fascinated by translation since she was a child, and this novel is a deep dive into the complexities and ambiguities of the role. A translator\u2019s job is to render the original as faithfully as possible, yet they are also creating a new work of their own with every word they type. It\u2019s an artistic paradox, the kind that can\u2019t be represented straightforwardly in fiction. It needs something special \u2013 and Croft does not disappoint. The book\u2019s narrator is a translator, one of eight who gather periodically at the home of Irena Rey, a critically acclaimed Polish novelist, to write versions of her latest book in their mother tongues. They are so bound up by their work that they refer to each other by their languages, rather than names. Our narrator is called Spanish and she uses the collective \u201cwe\u201d liberally, speaking for the group, especially with reference to Rey, whom they revere: \u201cWe were all in love with her.\u201d Spanish wants us to think the translators are of one mind, like a Greek chorus. There\u2019s a twist, though: the text we are reading, written by Spanish, has itself been translated by another of the eight, English \u2013 and Spanish and English do not get along. English makes it clear, in her prefatory Note from the Translator, that she has her suspicions about Spanish\u2019s version of events, and has \u201ccorrected\u201d a few things as she went along. So we are faced with a (possibly) unreliable narrator, translated by a (possibly) unreliable translator. It\u2019s a hall of mirrors worthy of Nabokov, and indeed, there are echoes of his great work Pale Fire in the snide, funny footnotes English scatters through the text (\u201cHere I have preserved her ridiculous word\u201d). Upon this complex scaffolding Croft hangs a vivid story about what happens to the eight translators when Rey goes missing, leaving them alone in her house on the edge of Poland\u2019s Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest, a primal wilderness teeming with life. They search for her in its mossy undergrowth, but find only fungi \u2013 a central metaphor of the book, for what are translators if not symbionts, perhaps even parasites, using the raw materials of someone else\u2019s creativity to produce a florescence of their own? The group are lost until an email arrives with the text of Rey\u2019s new novel, ready for translation, at which point they learn each other\u2019s names and Spanish\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d falls away as each begins to assert their own identity. Drama ensues, secrets are spilt, characters couple up and the search for Rey becomes increasingly bizarre and unpredictable. There\u2019s a lot going on here; indeed, the book resembles Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest in its wild and fertile proliferation of ideas. Croft just about manages to keep it all together, although her fondness for themes and metaphors comes at the expense of character development. The warring English and Spanish are a marvellous double act, but others who could also have been interesting (Serbian and Slovenian, for instance) are neglected. And the ending, which unites the group once more, falls a little flat after the intense 300-page buildup that has gone before. But it is to Croft\u2019s credit that she sustains her claustrophobic narrative so deftly, with plenty of plot twists. What ultimately makes this book such a pleasure, though, is the uniqueness of its perspective. Reading a translator translating a translator is a brain-twister like no other, and it can\u2019t fail to change the way you think about language. It feels like a privilege, too, to appreciate the passages that seem to have been written specifically to amuse her colleagues. Notably English\u2019s version of a work by a Polish poet deemed untranslatable, which runs: \u201cThe world persists, but insecurely! / The rustling trees grow ultratreely!\u201d You can picture translators gleefully texting it to each other with laughing-face emojis. It\u2019s a glimpse into a profession that serves as a fascinating metaphor for our parasitic, multilingual, creatively prolific world. \u2022 The Extinction of Irena Rey by Jennifer Croft is published by Scribe (\u00a316.99).

The lessons in how to dress, or the lessons in how to live? Iris Apfel\u2019s 102 years were a masterclass in both. Really, of course, there\u2019s no debate. We start with the clothes, because the clothes are entirely unignorable. Not so much outfits, as living tableaux. A coat of gold-tipped duck feathers topped with a lei of turquoise pebbles at the neck. Embroidered Indian silk tunics with fringed suede trousers. Fuchsia satin boots and a banana-yellow tulle cape. Bangles stacked to the elbow, a slash of lipstick bright as apricot jam, those delicate, bird-like knuckles dusted with a clatter of sweetie-toned cocktail rings. Every day, Apfel left the house dressed as a picture of joy. \u201cLife is grey and dull,\u201d she says, in her deliciously chewy New York accent, in Albert Maysles\u2019 2014 documentary about her life. \u201cYou might as well have a little fun dressing up.\u201d But despite the rainbow pandemonium of her wardrobe and the cacophony of the egg-sized nuggets of souk-bought gems that rattled as she walked, there was a purity to her. She had incredible taste, but no snobbery. She once explained that her passion for accessorising came from her mother, who taught her that \u201cif you bought, for example, a simple little black dress, by changing the accessories, which are so transformative, you could make dozens of outfits out of the same basic piece.\u201d Apfel wore Dior haute couture with flea-market jewellery, layered a vintage Balenciaga coat over a Mickey Mouse T-shirt, mixed 19th-century ecclesiastical vestments with Topshop. As a designer and consultant she worked for H&amp;M and for the White House \u2013 Mrs Nixon, apparently, was \u201clovely\u201d \u2013 for Faye Dunaway and for Tommy Hilfiger. Her passion for beauty was democratic. Status, price tags, money \u2013 these were never the point. The pleasure came from joy. In a 2010 interview with the Observer, she explained that the first painting she ever bought, still hanging in her hallway, is probably by Velasquez, but that she had never had it authenticated, because if it really was she might be nervous to leave it hanging there, and what would be the point in that, since she wouldn\u2019t enjoy it? Apfel didn\u2019t dress like anyone else, because she didn\u2019t think like anyone else. She was a true original. And for all her iconoclasm, there was something august and stately about Apfel. She was a true aesthete, a deeply respected textile expert. You have to know the rules of style well to be able to break them with grace, and she did. She defied every rule of how a snowy-haired older woman should dress yet somehow retained an almost old-fashioned elegance. There was method in the madness, as well as irreverent humour. \u201cI think when you\u2019re paying $15,000 for a dress you\u2019re entitled to a pair of sleeves,\u201d she said in 2015. \u201cIt makes me crazy. Because everybody knows that older women, no matter how much of a jock you are, you look like a horse\u2019s arse in a strappy dress.\u201d There was wisdom behind those owlish glasses. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to do is live in the present, which is what I have always done,\u201d was one of many soundbites every bit as splendid as her best looks. Her 102 years are a testament to the energising power of fashion and it is fitting that, when she went, it was with chic timing, in the middle of Paris fashion week.

As long as our previously established Horlicks drinking game hasn\u2019t already put you to sleep, we have reached the end of a very safe evening, extremely short on anything political even by the Brits\u2019 standards. No firebrand performances, no references to Israel and Palestine; just one stand for trans rights, one for the sub-postmasters affected by the Horizon scandal and one for the rights of songwriters. It\u2019s not that you go to primetime shiny-floor ITV awards shows for biting commentary, but \u2026 there was a lot of unclaimed potential there. Maybe some of the nominees who lost out to Raye\u2019s \u2013 very deserved \u2013 wins had something up their festive sleeves. We\u2019ll never know. Having not had a hit of any substance since 2010, in recent years Kylie made genre forays into country and disco along with a Christmas album, and it looked like she was pootling off into cosy Radio 2 land. But she swerved decisively back to pop with Padam Padam: malevolently sexy and powered by firmly up-to-date programming, it sent a wriggle of pleasure through summer 2023, although people saying \u201cPadam?\u201d as a question got old after about five minutes. There\u2019s a whisper of Spinning Around as a portentous fanfare builds like the score to a particularly depressing Christopher Nolan film \u2013 but then we\u2019re into Padam Padam, with Kylie appearing atop a lofty plinth, that bit of staging long beloved by X Factor, Eurovision and more. She channels the same endearing everywoman energy she had on stage at that epic Glasto performance, clearly enjoying herself and \u2013 unlike Robbie Williams unforgivably didn\u2019t do in this slot a few years ago \u2013 just gives us hit after hit. Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Head begets a bit of Slow and then Love At First Sight \u2013 which squeezes even more dancefloor euphoria than Calvin &amp; Ellie and Chase &amp; Status managed. She keeps the dopamine pumping by finishing with All the Lovers, jumping around for the drop like a kid who\u2019s double-dropped fistfuls of Haribo. It\u2019s a wonderfully unguarded and joyous ending, matching Raye\u2019s jubiliation at her historic wins. Padam padam indeed! Our de facto national treasure (borrowed from Australia) acknowledges her lifetime in pop and the people who have buoyed her along the way: \u201cAlright I\u2019m just gonna be sobbing with Raye.

Like Raye he gets a souped-up full-band arrangement but this one actually suits the song much better; the tempo has been slightly upped to keep the energy high, and perhaps to free up some more space for Maya Jama chatting about getting wrecked, as is her wont. But there\u2019s still space for the song to simmer down to a tender standstill, then explode into a bombastic coda. Rema has a gorgeous open book of a voice, and he negotiates the song\u2019s little curlicues with ease, making this one of the night\u2019s best performances. He\u2019s wearing the kind of fur hat that would see you right through a Yukon winter, and as a broadsheet journalist and father it behoves me to say \u201che must be bloody boiling in that\u201d. Named record of the year at the Grammys last month, Flowers now gets \u2026 more flowers at the Brits, though it\u2019s a fairly generic song in a category filled with more innovative ones \u2013 Doja Cat\u2019s Paint the Town Red, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Vampire, Rema\u2019s Calm Down, SZA\u2019s Kill Bill, Tyla\u2019s Water. Still, in terms of UK impact, it spent 10 weeks at UK No 1 last year, so the gong makes sense. Like most international superstars, Miley isn\u2019t here \u2013 \u201cwe forgive her cos she\u2019s got incredible hair,\u201d says presenter Bimini \u2013 but she\u2019s sent a video in which she is sporting massive hair and a tiny sparkly dress! \u201cHello to everybody at the Brits. I wanted to say thank you so much for voting Flowers as the international song of the year, and a special thank you for giving me somewhere to wear this dress. It\u2019s incredible to win but the real prize is having this incredible song hit around the world. I know this video is a little short but I just wanted it to match my dress.\u201d And with a twirl, she\u2019s done. The Canadian critic Carl Wilson recently described Miley as the next Cher, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. Finally, something approaching a political statement, after the brief Post Office comment earlier on. Presenting the international song category, former Drag Race star Bimini says: \u201cRight now in the UK it\u2019s a really difficult time for a lot of people, and trans people and non binary people more so, and I want you to know that everyone in this room loves you and you are valid, and trans rights are human rights.\u201d The reliance on drinking gags is so desperate that Roman Kemp is doing shots with Calvin Harris, who is long sober and having a mocktail. Though the \u201creveal\u201d is that Kemp\u2019s drink is a Saltburn shot, labelled \u201cHarry Styles\u2019 bathwater\u201d. Harris professes to have liked it. If this is what passes for spicy \u2026 someone smash the emergency \u201cJack Whitehall and Haim\u201d button. This is a pretty formidable category full of hugely worthy winners \u2013 Central Cee, Dave, J Hus, Jessie Ware, Little Simz \u2013 but claimed again by Raye, who looks around as if she\u2019s waiting for a candid camera to pop out. She even opens the envelope to check that yes, she has won her fifth award of the night. \u201cThank you to the Brits. There are so many ridiculously incredible artists here tonight, so this is especially overwhelming. Man, what is happening? What the hell is happening? Shoutout Croydon! South London! What! Shoutout my team! My sisters! My best friend Carly, I love you so much Carly, don\u2019t start me off! Thank you, this is unfair, this is unfair, this is wild. Somebody take this mic off me, I\u2019ve had my first drink. Thank you to the Brits, thank you so much!\u201d Can she make it to seven? Let\u2019s find out! Becky Hill won the dance category the last two years and was Olivia-Colman-at-the-Oscars levels of endearing when picking up each: someone who palpably loves dance music culture and isn\u2019t too cool to pretend she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s right there in her singing voice, too \u2013 gloriously histrionic and keen of feeling \u2013 and she\u2019s now become the patron saint of nights out in clubs where you make questionable life choices. Legend has it that if write \u201cmotive\u201d on a Be At One mirror in lipstick and chant her name three times she jumps out with a J\u00e4gerbomb. Chase &amp; Status\u2019s stock meanwhile is higher than ever: having stayed with a drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene that had waned out of the charts in recent years, they were ready to capitalise when it inevitably came back around, with their outrageously huge track Baddadan. They open with a snatch of Baddadan delivered by Irah, and then into the Hill-helmed Disconnect, whose headily rising melody has the requisite wobbly-eyed dancefloor headrush. They switch back again to Baddadan, if only for a brief spell, and back to Disconnect \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to conjure the feel of switching between two decks in a nightclub at the cavernous O2 Arena, but all concerned make a good stab at it, and Hill is in typically brilliant voice. This was a shot in the arm for a slightly deflated Brits. Hard to tell why some of the pre-announced awards, such as this one, are properly televised and some aren\u2019t; and whether producer is meant to acknowledge \u201csomeone who makes other people\u2019s songs\u201d or \u201cproduces dance music\u201d. Anyway. Here\u2019s a nice VT on how the duo drew inspiration from rave and have been ploughing the drum\u2019n\u2019bass furrow for nearly 20 years, albeit an incorrect voiceover about how they\u2019ve \u201cheadlined\u201d Glastonbury (they haven\u2019t). Saul Milton thanks the fans/mums/wives/management and \u201cthe big man Naylor\u201d, while Will Kennard adds: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to represent British music, to champion new talent always, but mostly tonight we are proud to represent drum\u2019n\u2019bass music.\u201d Presumably keeping things quick because they\u2019re up next with Becky Hill\u2026 There\u2019s a fairytale stardust across this performance, a coronation moment for a pop Cinderella who at one point was very much not invited to the ball, and left to toil in the depths of a major label for years. She extricated herself from that flatlining deal and became one of the UK\u2019s most successful independent artists, a turnaround marked by her record-breaking seven nominations. She\u2019s already won three Brits \u2013 and there\u2019s still some big awards she might still secure. She first performs Ice Cream Man on piano: a song about how she was sexually assaulted during a recording session, and the kind of raw and candid songwriting she didn\u2019t seem to get to make in her unhappy spell with Polydor Records. Then it\u2019s into an orchestral version of Prada, her mega-banger that earned her one of two song of the year nominations, and then a 1920s lindy-hop intro to Escapism \u2013 her other song of the year nomination \u2013 before switching up again into a sumptuous big band arrangement. For me, it\u2019s the crispness of the rap drum programming of the original that gives the song its urgency, and makes its tale of nihilist bacchanalia work, given that it\u2019s something you might actually listen to in a bout of nihilist bacchanalia. I don\u2019t think she needs the heavily telegraphed classiness of the orchestral version \u2013 this uniquely tortured song doesn\u2019t need or suit it \u2013 and perhaps there was too much packed into this megamix performance. But there\u2019s no doubting Raye\u2019s conviction, star quality and ability to carry her pain to the back of the biggest arenas \u2013 and it certainly looks like this evening is deservedly turning into that fairytale ending. Or rather beginning. Very brief cutaway to the table there as Clara Amfo introduces the Rising Star award winners. Says singer Abigail Morris of Raye\u2019s performance: \u201cYou know when Gaga did the VMAs in 2009? I feel like we just saw history being made.\u201d Finally, a proper Brits moment. Hair-raising! Boygenius announced their hiatus in February, presumably so that Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus can return to their respective solo careers. After winning three Grammy awards last month, this is a great final \u2013 for now \u2013 coronation for a supergroup greater than the sum of its parts, whose debut album The Record struck a huge chord with listeners and who were clearly having a great time during their performances and even their playful press (to wit: the brilliant photoshoot for our 2023 interview with them). Here they are on video, starting off with a massive \u201cwooooo!\u201d Julien: \u201cHello Brit awards, thank you for voting us best international group of the year!\u201d Lucy: \u201cWe wanna thank our label Polydor for making this possible. Long live Boygenius.\u201d Phoebe: \u201cThank you so much.\u201d Curious that ITV are leaning heavily on BBC property The Traitors here! Both Dua Lipa and Charli XCX are in this category on the strength of songs from the Barbie soundtrack, not even their own new album eras \u2013 both of which are just starting and will see them eligible next year \u2013 which suggests a barrel scraped a touch thin. But here\u2019s Dua winning the fan-voted category on the basis of Dance the Night. \u201cAmazing, thank you so much! Well I guess for more reasons than one my fans are the reasons why I\u2019m standing here today, so I wanna say a massive thank you to each and every single one of you who have voted for me. This means so much, I\u2019m so, so happy to be here. You guys give me this radical sense of confidence that I can do anything, I can try and experiment \u2026 and all the love and optimism and support is what inspires me, so thank you so much. Beyond that, it takes a village, so I want to thank my dad-ager \u2026 [thanks team/label at length, you can imagine the rest].\u201d If you need a pr\u00e9cis on who Jungle are, they named themselves after the some of the most forward-thinking music in the UK, and then proceeded to make some of the most backward-thinking music in the UK. They started out with the Fifa 14 loading screen-core of stuff like Busy Earnin\u2019 and have since graduated to what is very much the \u201clive laugh love\u201d of funk and soul music, with less edge than my toddler-proofed kitchen. Their decidedly un-pyroclastic 2023 album Volcano sound like a tepid mix of other artists with everything that made those artists good removed \u2013 it\u2019s no-sodium Sault; not so much the Temptations as the Ooh No I Musn\u2019ts. Or like someone asked that Adobe AI music software that dropped this week for \u201cJ Dilla for Tory barbecues\u201d. Indeed, they\u2019re so blah they should probably be put on an Arts Council protection list for artists most under threat of being replaced by artificial intelligence. They seem nice and one of them cried a bit at winning best group and I\u2019m not so jaded to not go a bit gooey at that \u2013 but come on, Young Fathers are right there. They\u2019re playing their sleeper hit Back on 74 which does have a pretty, if rather inconsequential-feeling, chorus melody \u2013 and the strutting dancers lift the cruise-ship-at-teatime feel just a little. But this is one of the most forgettable performance I can remember at the Brits, which is to say it feels like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones barged past Guardian security and hit me with that Men In Black mind ray. The earth spins onward and leaves this behind. This is an astonishing win, given that Casisdead is substantially less commercially successful than Central Cee, Little Simz, Dave and J Hus \u2013 and in a completely separate lane, too, flowing over a kind of 80s-inspired synthwave vibe. No one knows who he actually is \u2013 and that\u2019s not his \u201creal\u201d face, covered as it is by subtle prosthetics. It\u2019s a testament to him building a really devoted fanbase, in thrall to someone who has charted his own weird way through UK rap culture, shrugging off genre labels as he goes. \u201cThis is well funny. Look man, there\u2019s so many people involved in this record, I don\u2019t have time to thank everyone cos I know you wanna get pissed up so I\u2019ll keep it moving. I\u2019ll thank you guys personally later. Buy the vinyl cos the thank yous are in the vinyl. But what I do wanna do is take the time to thank the stans, without you none of this would happen \u2026 Thank you XL for letting me do what I want.\u201d And let Charli run the whole thing, co-presenting this award. \u201cShout out to all the hot girls in the place, where you at! Dua Lipa, Raye, where you at! OK we should do our job\u2026\u201d I feel like Fred Again and Romy have had more cultural significance this year but you can\u2019t argue with Miracle, the Ellie Goulding collab we saw earlier, spending eight weeks at UK No 1 last year. \u201cWow. Wow. Thank you. First and foremost I wanna dedicate this award to Danny Rampling\u2019s Love Groove Dance Party. I wanna thank Ellie Goulding, wherever she is. Ellie, I wouldnae be on this stage this year if it wasn\u2019t for you. What you brought to Miracle was unbelievable, I couldn\u2019t have done this with anybody else. Burns, who I\u2019ve been working with this year finally, my old friend, finally making tunes together this year. And I wanna say thank you to my beautiful wife [Vick Hope].\u201d JUST GIVE THE AWARD TO CHARLI, GIVE ALL THE AWARDS TO CHARLI Raye only needs one more award to tie Adele, Blur and and Harry Styles for the most awards received in a single year (ie four). As I wrote yesterday, \u201cbest new artist\u201d does seem like a particularly poignant category for Raye, who is nine years into her career but only started her second creatively free act two years ago. Great haughty pout from fellow nominee PinkPantheress there; meanwhile Raye and the lady handing out the microphone appear to be on first-name terms at this point: \u201cWhat is actually happening right now \u2018cause I just don\u2019t understand! I have to thank my mum and my dad who are also part of my team, and my grandma. Yes grandma! I, in ways, do feel like a new artist. I released my first song when I was 15, my first mixtape when I was 16, don\u2019t go and listen to it because it\u2019s not that good any more. But I do feel like a new artist, I got to start again. The artist I was three years ago would not believe what she\u2019s seeing today. I\u2019m my own boss now, I\u2019m in control. Thank you!\u201d Wait! Clara\u2019s out to give Raye another award, mentioning how she gave Raye her first radio play back when she was a teenager \u2013 and giving her the previously announced songwriter of the year award. (Which also makes the best new artist thing a bit absurd.) \u201cBrit awards coming like buses, you wait for one and three come along!\u201d says Clara, while Raye shakes her head and laughs \u2013 then remembers what she wants to say, taking a stand for songwriters\u2019 rights: \u201cOh wait sorry! Please, whilst I\u2019m here, British record music industry please, I just wanna have a brief conversation about normalising giving songwriters master royalty points. It can be net costs, it doesn\u2019t have to be at your expense, but it means if songs win big the writers win big too. Please allow that to happen.\u201d Even a year ago this booking might have felt a bit B-list but McRae has become so absolutely enormous in the interim that this now feels like a bit of a coup. Greedy, up for best international song, has been a vast success on streaming, and follow-up Exes hasn\u2019t done shabbily either. Anyone who had her pegged as a Billie Eilish clone in the wake of her bruised piano ballad You Broke Me First has been comprehensively proven wrong: some of her best performances have been over throbbing deep house (You), tech-y EDM (10.35) and glossy new wave (She\u2019s All I Wanna Be). We\u2019re getting Greedy here, and there\u2019s lots of purposeful walking while she lets the backing track do the heavy lifting. Of course there\u2019s a segment ringfenced for her to do her oft-viral bougie-streetdance choreography \u2013 and while my cardio levels are such that I could barely say my own name after doing all that, she does stay firmly in her vocal comfort zone again, idly moving around her middle range. It does feel a bit phoned-in, and can\u2019t help but feel disappointing given this is the biggest American star the Brits have conjured this year. Meanwhile, I\u2019m also having a full-on new-dad moment at being baffled by her abdominal fashion choices. OK new drinking game: take a sip of Horlicks every time the presenters make another wearying booze gag (\u201cgag\u201d) and hopefully you\u2019ll have conked out before the night ends. And we\u2019re back to the dreadful drinking \u201cgags\u201d, a mainstay of the Mo Gilligan era. Is Kylie Minogue going to drink from a shoe in the Australian \u201cshoey\u201d tradition? \u2026 Yes she is. Just say stilett-no. Oh boy, can\u2019t wait for \u201cAmerican superstar\u201d Tate McRae (she\u2019s Canadian) after the break. Maya Jama might be playing hard and fast with accuracy there on more than one level. The Brits can struggle to attract international pop superstars and hardly any of this category is here \u2013 only Asake, Caroline Polachek, CMAT and Kylie Minogue seem to be here from the nominations \u2013 and so it is with the winner SZA, who had a huge year in 2023 thanks to the December 2022 release of her sublime second album SOS and only appears tonight in video form. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for this honour, thank you for bumping my music, and I hear you\u2019re at the O2 which is my favourite \u2026 and I should be back really soon!\u201d I\u2019m on the floor among the celebs and everyone is wearing black leather \u2013 that seems to be a look this year. A lot of leather trousers on the men. All the ex-Love Islanders were loving Calvin and Ellie, which says a lot. ITV and the British music industry\u2019s primetime Saturday night showcase is going down well on Twitter. The only way to jazz it up: massive Kate Middleton reveal in the middle of Jungle\u2019s performance. The Sheffield band win the all-male category in a rare mainstream showing for British metal, often sorely overlooked at the Brits and the Mercury award. It\u2019s their first ever Brit award, though they performed live with Ed Sheeran a couple of years ago. I am extremely here for the cutaways to an extremely bored-looking Young Fathers, who should have won this. But here\u2019s to BMTH\u2019s sweary speech, which leads to a good part of it being blanked out. Oli Sykes: \u201cI reyt don\u2019t know what to say \u2018cause we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be winning this at all. Cheers to the Brits for making the voting system so complicated only our fans could be arsed, thanks to our fans [sweary sweary swearing] This is bloody insane this. Cheers to our management, family, all that stuff. I\u2019m not gonna say owt else, thank you so much, cheers. Reyt good.\u201d The UK may be a petty, pursed-lipped, radically ungenerous island \u2013 but certain things get me waving a Union Jack like I\u2019m the admin for a Facebook page about Spitfire maintenance, and our love of dance music is one of them. More than rap, more than indie-rock, more than Dua Lipa trying really hard, commercial dance is our national pop music, and the way we rallied around Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding\u2019s Miracle to send it to No 1 for eight weeks had me staring wistfully off the white cliffs of Dover. My millennial nostalgia was juiced by Harris essentially splicing trance classics Tell It to My Heart, Castles In the Sky and Seven Days and One Week, and Goulding\u2019s ethereality makes her the perfect trance vocalist. But you don\u2019t get a hit of this stature through nostalgia alone: it\u2019s a copper-bottomed bit of songwriting. Ellie Goulding stays in that ethereal tone throughout, rarely bringing in that rougher grade of sandpaper that so differentiates her voice from the rest of her peers \u2013 and of course Calvin uninterestingly prods some equipment that may or may not be plugged in. But just as this performance starts to feel a bit mid, he gives it the full Sundissential treatment with a hard-trance breakdown lifted from the Hardwell remix, as Ellie bounds around with her backing dancers like they\u2019re a bunch of kids who have just set a toilet on fire at Leeds festival. Vibes retrieved! Two down! This one is voted for by the public via Instagram. It\u2019s a new standalone genre category after musicians and fans complained about R&amp;B being conjoined with the pop slot last year: one of those musicians, Mahalia, was nominated this year. Arguably Raye does so much more than R&amp;B \u2013 and if we\u2019re talking genre purists, it would have been lovely to see Cleo Sol win this \u2013 but I begrudge her precisely nothing. \u201cWhat!\u201d she mouths as the camera turns to her. \u201cHi! Look I just wanna say, when I was about 16, 15 years old, I wanted to be an R&amp;B artist, that\u2019s what I would say. And I was told, I think, a lie that R&amp;B doesn\u2019t sell in the UK so I needed to learn how to make different kinds of music. I know that\u2019s a bit shady but I need to say R&amp;B is so important and there are so many R&amp;B artists in the UK eating it up. I wanna shout out to Mahalia, who campaigned for this award, Cleo Sol, who\u2019s immaculate, Sault. This really is a lot \u2013 thank you.\u201d MORE SHADE PLEASE! I will be passing Ben the smelling salts during this one as I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever known him to love a song so much in the six-plus years we\u2019ve worked together. I find Ellie Goulding\u2019s voice a bit like opening a bag of icing sugar, accidentally inhaling a bit and choking. \u201cThere\u2019s been some pretty awesome bands that have come out of the UK,\u201d says Billie Joe Armstrong. But \u2026 Jungle? Really? Young Fathers should have blitzed this with their fantastic, absurdist sound, showcased on last year\u2019s Heavy Heavy, our No 2 album of the year \u2013 and they look pretty nonplussed at their table \u2013 but instead it goes to Jungle, tepid white soul pastiche artists whose greatest contribution to British music is a lot of soundtracks for sports montages. It\u2019s their first Brit nomination and thus award, and they spend their excitable acceptance speech \u2013 which features the first sweary sound blot-out of the night on the ITV feed \u2013 thanking their team and families. Forgettable in every way. One down, five possible gongs to go! Raye wins her first award of the night for Escapism, one of the songs she claimed was left collecting dust in a filing cabinet when her former label Polydor declined to release it. More fool them: Raye went it alone as an independent artist, the song hit UK No 1, was the biggest-selling song by a British female artist in 2023 and it went many-times platinum all over the world. She is literally leaping up and down with glee \u2013 and in bare feet. \u201cAhhh! What! Thank you God, like wow! I\u2019m shaking. I didn\u2019t \u2026 I don\u2019t really know what to say right now but thank you, thank you to my team. Wow, I\u2019ve always dreamed of saying that, \u2018thank you to my team\u2019. Thank you to my distribution company who are called Human Resources, a small little imprint in America, no one else would take my songs but J [Erving], thank you for believing in this music. Thank you to Mike Sabbath, who collaborated on my entire album on this song. He made the beat, I heard it in the car. I can\u2019t believe this is happening, aaah!\u201d Loving her saying that she\u2019s always dreamed of saying \u201cthank you to my team\u201d! A graceful barb. Plus in the presenters\u2019 prelude, we got our first political statement of the night from the stars of ITV\u2019s Mr Bates vs the Post Office: \u201cIn spite of what the government say, they\u2019re not paying the postmasters.\u201d It would be inaccurate to say that Dua Lipa is entering her flop era \u2013 the first singles from her upcoming album, Houdini and Training Season, are currently in or around the top 20 most streamed songs globally on Spotify. But there\u2019s something a little gimlet-eyed in how they\u2019re written \u2013 catchy in a grimly determined rather than breezily natural way \u2013 that makes them hard to love, and some mean media types (not me, yet!) are wondering if she could be on the way down the other side of fame\u2019s hill. Well, that performance should quieten them down a bit. Dressed in her second leather ensemble of the night, she launches into Training Season and while I find this song really quite plodding and funkless on record, Lipa lifts this B-tier material with a really robust vocal performance \u2013 she sounds like she absolutely has to have the sexual-spiritual connection she\u2019s singing about, and her voice doesn\u2019t waver even when strutting around a populous troupe of acrobatic dancers. That\u2019s the kind of boot-camp vocal training that only peak pop stars can haul themselves through \u2013 and it makes for a potent opening. We\u2019re graced with a new cohort of presenters this year, Clara Amfo, Maya Jama and Roman Kemp. All dyed-in-the-wool actual presenters, the Brits are seemingly going for \u201cabject professionalism\u201d this year after the shambolic \u201ccomedy\u201d of Mo Gilligan the past two years. Or \u2026 70s variety show with this Love Island \u201ckiss cam\u201d bit? What! (I have never seen Love Island and have no idea what is going on here.) This Dua Lipa performance of Training Season is giving James Bond opening titles via Cirque de Soleil. Will this performance vanquish the \u201cgo on girl give us nothing\u201d meme spawned by her performance at the 2018 Brit awards? Pity these poor dancers, suspended above the stage waiting for Dua Lipa\u2019s opening performance to start. Excellent stuff happening on the ITV2 red carpet feed as the presenter asks Caroline Polachek whether her dress, with its elf-ears-cum-Madonna-cone-bra is \u201ca homemade affair\u201d? \u201cIf only,\u201d she says, barely hiding her disdain. \u201cThis is a Jean Paul Gaultier and Simone Rocha collab.\u201d [Presses delete on part two of costume box joke.] Two of Green Day here, looking like a middle-aged goth couple who used to be cool but have rung your Ring doorbell four times about your poor recycling bin management in recent weeks, but you\u2019re ignoring them, so they\u2019re getting right up to the camera to express their disapproval. Did Griff: 1. Struggle from option paralysis about which outfit to wear? 2. Have a fight with the Last Dinner Party over the costume box? Hard to tell. Olly Alexander, AKA our Eurovision entry this year, which is \u2026 fine. Bit mid-table. If you\u2019re a country people actually like. Which we\u2019re not. Here\u2019s Laura\u2019s review from yesterday. Big \u201cLawrence Llewellyn-Bowen hosting an immersive murder mystery weekend\u201d energy to this frock coat. Brits awards-art history hive: is that Joan of Arc down there? What does this represent if so? Shout out to Cass\u00f6, who is wearing an outfit so boring I haven\u2019t even bothered to crop the whole thing, but who I massively venerate after he made the mighty Prada \u2013 a huge high-tempo dance banger splicing Raye and D-Block Europe with the energy emanating from a Renault Clio packed with five 17-year-olds. He made it on a laptop while he was at Swansea uni and ended up becoming one of the biggest songs of 2023, spending 22 weeks in the Top 10, five of them at No 2 \u2013 and now it\u2019s up for song of the year. An unfairly little-trumpeted British success story. Here\u2019s Annie Clark AKA St Vincent, who just presented the Last Dinner Party with their Rising Star award on the ITV2 red carpet coverage \u2013 quite possibly because guitarist Emily Roberts plays a signature St Vincent guitar on stage. And there you have it: Joe Keery from Stranger Things, looking like the rhythm guitarist from a band in 2007 who are trying to get past that bruising 4/10 in the NME in 2005. Actually, though, he\u2019s a properly massive pop star as well, recording as Djo \u2013 his song End of Beginning is currently the fifth most streamed song in the world right now on Spotify with 5m plays a day. Oh spirit come, we beckon you! Oh wait it\u2019s best international artist nominee Caroline Polachek. Speaking of the Last Dinner Party, here is Alexis Petridis\u2019s review of their very hyped debut album. Bring Me the Horizon here, looking like they\u2019ve just been busted for smoking weed by their mum who\u2019s wandered over to the bus shelter with their dad hovering impotently behind. Hand it over lads! Look, to my mind they\u2019re the best band in the UK and would be thoroughly deserving winners of the rock/alternative category they\u2019re nominated in, following a year of awesome singles. Is it post-ironic to wear a dress saying \u201cI\u2019m Only Here For Your Entertainment\u201d in a sarcastic font to a primetime ITV-screened industry \u201cbash\u201d? Jury\u2019s out. Kylie looking overjoyed as you would be if you\u2019d been named a Global Icon (capital letters very much warranted). There will undoubtedly be a comprehensive costume change for when she accepts that award and probably another for closing the show with, we presume, a hits megamix centred around Padam Padam \u2013 by which time every music industry functionary will have had around twelve (12) bottles of wine and will be throwing shapes like someone bringing a plane into land in high winds. And the winner of next year\u2019s best song category is here: if you haven\u2019t heard Charli XCX\u2019s aggressively brilliant comeback single Von Dutch yet, you\u2019re 547 plays behind me and can catch up right here. Can\u2019t believe Victoria Beckham circa 2001 is here! Hello, Laura here. This week I learned that in 1959, Volvo invented the three-point car seatbelt and recognised that it was such a gamechanger in safety that the Swedish automobilists gave away the patent to other companies for free. Just on my mind as I look at this photo of best dance act nominee \u2013 and previous winner \u2013 Becky Hill for no reason, I am sure. (Becky is one of my favourite Brits characters of recent years thanks to her propensity for enjoying her table\u2019s liquid wares before coming up to collect her gongs.) I know it\u2019s a journo cliche to say that someone has dressed up like a Quality Street, but Jacob Collier is wearing three distinct Quality Street wrappers here and you very much suspect he considered a fourth. So all the multifarious reality TV stars who get on the red carpet at about 2pm yesterday have all filed through, leaving us with some actual musicians. Here\u2019s Casisdead, making a brilliant effort with a phalanx of bodyguards branded with his Deadcorp project name. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of his album last year \u2013 I felt like the lyricism didn\u2019t meet the ambition of the overall endeavour \u2013 but he admirably does a lot more world-building than most British artists, creating an entire cyperpunk dystopia as a backdrop for his tales of crime and trauma. He\u2019s the outside bet in the rap genre category, up against some big beasts in the form of Central Cee, Dave, Little Simz and J Hus \u2013 but it\u2019s fan-voted, and his fans adore him, so he\u2019s got a chance. It may have less star power than the Grammys, less critical clout than the Mercury and essentially be a celebration of naked commercial success \u2013 but dammit, the Brit awards remain one of the most silly, palpably British and occasionally quite subversive shows in the global awards season. The big story this year is Raye already winning songwriter of the year and scoring a record seven nominations across the field tonight \u2013 including two in song of the year. Can she convert any, or indeed all of them? But there\u2019ll be plenty more action besides, from Dua Lipa opening the show to Kylie closing it as the Global Icon award winner. Join us here as we rate and slate the live performances and red carpet looks, and chart all the award-winners, speeches and \u2013 this being the Brits \u2013 moments of evident drunkenness.

But there\u2019s something a little gimlet-eyed in how they\u2019re written \u2013 catchy in a grimly determined rather than breezily natural way \u2013 that makes them hard to love, and some mean media types (not me, yet!) are wondering if she could be on the way down the other side of fame\u2019s hill. Well, this performance should quieten them down a bit. Dressed in her second leather ensemble of the night, she launches into Training Season and while I find this song really quite plodding and funkless on record, Lipa lifts this B-tier material with a really robust vocal performance \u2013 she sounds like she absolutely has to have the sexual-spiritual connection she\u2019s singing about, and her voice doesn\u2019t waver even when strutting around a populous troupe of acrobatic dancers. That\u2019s the kind of boot-camp vocal training that only peak pop stars can haul themselves through \u2013 and it makes for a potent opening. Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding The UK may be a petty, pursed-lipped, radically ungenerous island \u2013 but certain things get me waving a Union Jack like I\u2019m the admin for a Facebook page about Spitfire maintenance, and our love of dance music is one of them. More than rap, more than indie-rock, more than Dua Lipa trying really hard, commercial dance is our national pop music, and the way we rallied around Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding\u2019s Miracle to send it to No 1 for eight weeks had me staring wistfully off the white cliffs of Dover. My millennial nostalgia was juiced by Harris essentially splicing trance classics Tell It to My Heart, Castles In the Sky and Seven Days and One Week, and Goulding\u2019s ethereality makes her the perfect trance vocalist. But you don\u2019t get a hit of this stature through nostalgia alone: it\u2019s a copper-bottomed bit of songwriting. Goulding stays in that ethereal tone throughout, rarely bringing in that rougher grade of sandpaper that so differentiates her voice from the rest of her peers \u2013 and of course Harris uninterestingly prods some equipment that may or may not be plugged in. But just as this performance starts to feel a bit mid, he gives it the full Sundissential treatment with a hard-trance breakdown taken from the song\u2019s remix by Hardwell, as Goulding bounds around with her backing dancers like they\u2019re a bunch of kids who have just set a toilet on fire at Leeds festival. Vibes retrieved! Tate McRae Even a year ago this booking might have felt a bit B-list but McRae has become so absolutely enormous in the interim that this now feels like a bit of a coup. Greedy, up for best international song, has been a vast success on streaming, and follow-up Exes hasn\u2019t done shabbily either. Anyone who had her pegged as a Billie Eilish clone in the wake of her bruised piano ballad You Broke Me First has been comprehensively proven wrong: some of her best performances have been over throbbing deep house (You), tech-y EDM (10.35) and glossy new wave (She\u2019s All I Wanna Be). We\u2019re getting Greedy here, and there\u2019s lots of purposeful walking while she lets the backing track do the heavy lifting. Of course there\u2019s a segment ringfenced for her to do her oft-viral bougie-streetdance choreography \u2013 and while my cardio levels are such that I could barely say my own name after doing all that, she does stay firmly in her vocal comfort zone again, idly moving around her middle range. It does feel a bit phoned-in, and can\u2019t help but feel disappointing given this is the biggest across-the-pond star the Brits have conjured this year. Meanwhile, I\u2019m also having a full-on new-dad moment at being baffled by her abdominal fashion choices. Jungle If you need a pr\u00e9cis on who Jungle are, they named themselves after the some of the most forward-thinking music in the UK, and then proceeded to make some of the most backward-thinking music in the UK. They started out with the Fifa-14-loading-screen-core of stuff like Busy Earnin\u2019 and have since graduated to what is very much the \u201clive laugh love\u201d of funk and soul music, with less edge than my toddler-proofed kitchen. Their decidedly un-pyroclastic 2023 album Volcano sound like a tepid mix of other artists with everything that made those artists good removed \u2013 it\u2019s no-sodium Sault; not so much the Temptations as the Ooh No I Musn\u2019ts. Or like someone asked that Adobe AI music software that dropped this week for \u201cJ Dilla for Tory barbecues\u201d. Indeed, they\u2019re so blah they should probably be put on an Arts Council protection list for artists most under threat of being replaced by artificial intelligence. They seem nice and one of them cried a bit at winning best group and I\u2019m not so jaded to not go a bit gooey at that \u2013 but come on, Young Fathers are right there. They\u2019re playing their sleeper hit Back on 74 which does have a pretty, if rather inconsequential-feeling, chorus melody \u2013 and the strutting dancers lift the cruise-ship-at-teatime feel just a little. But this is one of the most forgettable performances I can remember at the Brits, which is to say it feels like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones barged past Guardian security and hit me with that Men In Black mind ray. The earth spins onward and leaves this behind. Raye There\u2019s fairytale stardust across this performance, a coronation moment for a pop Cinderella who at one point was very much not invited to the ball, and left to toil in the depths of a major label for years. She extricated herself from that flatlining deal and became one of the UK\u2019s most successful independent artists, a turnaround marked by her record-breaking seven nominations and six wins. She first performs Ice Cream Man on piano: a song about how she was sexually assaulted during a recording session, and it\u2019s the kind of raw and candid songwriting she didn\u2019t seem to get to make in her unhappy spell with Polydor Records. Then it\u2019s into an orchestral version of Prada, her mega-banger that earned her one of two song of the year nominations, and then a 1920s lindy-hop intro to Escapism \u2013 her other song of the year nomination \u2013 before switching up again into a sumptuous big band arrangement. For me, it\u2019s the crispness of the rap drum programming of the original that gives the song its urgency, and makes its tale of nihilist bacchanalia work, given that it\u2019s something you might actually listen to in a bout of nihilist bacchanalia. I don\u2019t think she needs the heavily telegraphed classiness of the orchestral version \u2013 this uniquely tortured song doesn\u2019t need or suit it \u2013 and perhaps there was too much packed into this megamix performance. But there\u2019s no doubting Raye\u2019s conviction, star quality and ability to carry her pain to the back of the biggest arenas. Chase &amp; Status and Becky Hill Becky Hill won the dance category the last two years and was Olivia-Colman-at-the-Oscars levels of endearing when picking up each: someone who palpably loves dance music culture and isn\u2019t too cool to pretend she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s right there in her singing voice, too \u2013 gloriously histrionic and keen of feeling \u2013 and she\u2019s now become the patron saint of nights out in clubs where you make questionable life choices. Legend has it that if write \u201cmotive\u201d on a Be At One mirror in lipstick and chant her name three times she jumps out with a J\u00e4gerbomb. Chase &amp; Status\u2019s stock meanwhile is higher than ever: having stayed with a drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene that had waned out of the charts in recent years, they were ready to capitalise when it inevitably came back around, with their outrageously huge track Baddadan. They open with a snatch of Baddadan delivered by Irah, and then into the Hill-helmed Disconnect, whose headily rising melody has the requisite wobbly-eyed dancefloor headrush. They switch back again to Baddadan, if only for a brief spell, and back to Disconnect \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to conjure the feel of switching between two decks in a nightclub at the cavernous O2 Arena, but all concerned make a good stab at it, and Hill is in typically brilliant voice. This was a shot in the arm for a slightly deflated Brits. Rema Long championed by the diaspora here, the rest of the UK has eventually come around to the charms of African pop, with massive chart hits for Burna Boy, Libianca and Tyla in recent years \u2013 and the biggest of all has been Calm Down by Nigerian vocalist Rema, which is the kind of perfect earworm that doesn\u2019t just go round your head all day but then also decides to buy a timeshare in your subconscious. Like Raye he gets a souped-up full-band arrangement but this one actually suits the song much better; the tempo has been slightly upped to keep the energy high, and perhaps to free up some more space for host Maya Jama chatting about getting wrecked, as is her wont. But there\u2019s still space for the song to simmer down to a tender standstill, then explode into a bombastic coda. Rema has a gorgeous open book of a voice, and he negotiates the song\u2019s little curlicues with ease, making this one of the night\u2019s best performances. He\u2019s wearing the kind of fur hat that would see you right through a Yukon winter, and as a broadsheet journalist and father it behoves me to say \u201che must be bloody boiling in that\u201d. Kylie Minogue Having not had a hit of any substance since 2010, in recent years Kylie made genre forays into country and disco along with a Christmas album, and it looked like she was pootling off into cosy Radio 2 land. But she swerved decisively back to pop with Padam Padam: malevolently sexy and powered by firmly up-to-date programming, it sent a wriggle of pleasure through summer 2023, although people saying \u201cPadam?\u201d as a question got old after about five minutes. There\u2019s a whisper of Spinning Around as a portentous fanfare builds like the score to a particularly depressing Christopher Nolan film \u2013 but then we\u2019re into Padam Padam, with Kylie appearing atop a lofty plinth, that bit of staging long beloved by X Factor, Eurovision and more. She channels the same endearing everywoman energy she had on stage at that epic Glasto performance, clearly enjoying herself and \u2013 unlike Robbie Williams unforgivably didn\u2019t do in this slot a few years ago \u2013 just gives us hit after hit. Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head begets a bit of Slow and then Love at First Sight \u2013 which squeezes even more dancefloor euphoria than Calvin &amp; Ellie and Chase &amp; Status managed. She keeps the dopamine pumping by finishing with All the Lovers, jumping around for the drop like a kid who\u2019s double-dropped fistfuls of Haribo. It\u2019s a wonderfully unguarded and joyous ending, matching Raye\u2019s jubiliation at her historic wins.", "date": "2024-03-03", "section": "Music", "author": "Ben Beaumont-Thomas", "id": 252, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/be5b1b47b1f52be41ddd569853edd806148068c1/0_667_3335_2000/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018The slap\u2019, protests and tears: what makes a memorable Oscar speech?

She has already spoken well at both the Golden Globes and Baftas when honoured for her role in The Holdovers. Let\u2019s hope she has something left in the bag. For Wendy Shanker it is a familiar predicament. The American script-doctor is regularly called upon to write a few wise words for potential award winners and at this time of year her phone is red hot. \u201cIt can be difficult if you\u2019ve already done acceptance speeches, like Da\u2019Vine. She will want to have kept back something that\u2019s unique for the Oscar. But then she might not get it,\u201d she said this weekend. \u201cSo I often help clients find that fine balance between making the most of it and hanging everything on it.\u201d On Oscar night, television viewers might well suspect some of the victorious stars have not prepared a jot. Sadly, in Shanker\u2019s view, this is often the case. \u201cI wish they would all write something. It\u2019s a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone should; even the dark horse nominees, not just the favourites.\u201d She suggests it is simply \u201cgracious to prepare something\u201d, rather than to hope to endear by stuttering out a few lines about gratitude and childhood destiny. \u201cBut I know why many don\u2019t prepare. They are superstitious and I do understand that,\u201d she said. Certainly, the pressure on nominees in Hollywood\u2019s Dolby theatre is immense. It is a career highlight like no other, after all. Even Steven Spielberg described it as \u201cthe best drink of water after the longest drought in my life\u201d when he finally won for Schindler\u2019s List in 1994. And, co-mingled with a fear of jinxing one\u2019s luck, it is easy to imagine a parallel concern that looking too slick could look entitled. Surely there are a few successful actors who don\u2019t enjoy all the hoopla and who are quietly willing the statuette into another nominee\u2019s hands? Generally not, says Shanker. \u201cThere are a few introverts, like Joaquin Phoenix, who really don\u2019t like the pomp and circumstance. But for most it\u2019s a dream, after years rehearsing an acceptance speech into their toothbrush.\u201d It was Phoenix who in 2020 gave a textbook seriously socially conscious speech when he won for Joker. He spoke at length about the shame of calves being taken from their mothers in service of milk production. \u201cWe go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources,\u201d he said. Was it a worthy use of a brief worldwide platform? Well, for Larry David it formed the basis of an episode of sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm in which Woody Harrelson parodied an actor who brings his vegetarian politics to the microphone at a moment of triumph. Other key political speeches from the Oscar archives include Michael Moore\u2019s criticism of the Iraq War as he received an award for his 2003 gun-control documentary, Bowling for Columbine. Moore was booed and later recalled being told, \u201cWow, you really know how to ruin a standing ovation.\u201d Vanessa Redgrave also went for broke when she criticised \u201cZionist hoodlums\u201d who were giving Jews a bad name when she picked up a best supporting actress gong in 1978. Better received was Frances McDormand, a winner in 2018, who called on Meryl Streep to lead the crowd in taking to her feet in support of the women in the industry. It is important to get your facts right though, as discovered by Spectre songwriter Sam Smith in 2016 after the false suggestion that \u201cno openly gay man had ever won\u201d before. Marlon Brando\u2019s notorious decision to get actor Sacheen Littlefeather to turn down his 1973 award, in protest at the treatment of American Indians, was dented by the revelation she was not a Native American. (This year Lily Gladstone, descended from the Blackfeet and Nez Perce nations, may actually make history by winning for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon.) Shanker is a fan of an emotional speech, as demonstrated by Sally Field in 1985, when she cried out deliriously: \u201cI can\u2019t deny the fact that you like me, right now, you like me!\u201d. Many will also recall Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s tears when she won for Shakespeare in Love in 1999. Her father had just been diagnosed with cancer and so she was forgiven. Will Smith\u2019s attempts to earn back credit after he slapped host Chris Rock in 2022 also had major wattage. Winning an Oscar later for King Richard, Smith said: \u201cIn this business, you\u2019ve got to be able to have people disrespecting you, and you\u2019ve got to smile and you\u2019ve got to pretend like that\u2019s OK.\u201d Another good route, if you have the comedy chops, is to have some fun. Witty Dianne Wiest, a best supporting actress for Hannah and Her Sisters, said: \u201cGee, this isn\u2019t like I imagined it would be in the bathtub.\u201d While Olivia Colman won laughs in 2019 for pointing starstruck at Lady Gaga, then poking her tongue out at the teleprompter urging her to wrap up. The prize for the longest speech still goes to Greer Garson who won for Mrs Miniver in 1943. \u201cI\u2019m practically unprepared,\u201d she began at 1am, then continued for seven minutes. Nowadays the ceremony\u2019s infamous, swelling \u201cget off the stage\u201d music would have harried her away. A final word must go to the weird ones: those speeches that have mystified or amused. Matthew McConaughey, accepting his award for Dallas Buyers Club in 2014, began by thanking God, then talked of chasing his \u201chero\u201d, himself a decade on, while Italian Roberto Benigni declared, \u201cI would like to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making love to everybody\u201d in his 1999 speech. Shanker, who sees herself as a secret weapon for nominees, advises clients to stay close to their public persona and to focus on enjoying the appreciation of their peers. It is not necessary, she insists, to thank everyone you ever met, which Julia Roberts, among others, did in 2001. \u201cYou may throw a few thanks out there,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you\u2019re Bradley Cooper in Maestro, you\u2019re going to want to thank the make-up artist.\u201d But perhaps the crown for Oscars\u2019 gratitude should go to Daniel Kaluuya, though, who in 2021 thanked many people, including his parents for originally having had sex \u2013 which clearly alarmed the middle-aged couple who were watching the show in front of a camera at home in London.", "date": "2024-03-03", "section": "Film", "author": "Vanessa Thorpe Arts and media correspondent", "id": 253, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eb381f4aa63dc7ebe7d3767fc3fc9d0e044f5de5/0_34_3434_2061/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Birmingham Royal Ballet: The Sleeping Beauty; Dimitris Papaioannou: Ink \u2013 review", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/mar/03/birmingham-royal-ballet-the-sleeping-beauty-birmingham-hippodrome-review-tour-dimitris-papaioannou-ink-sadlers-wells", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.067, "neu": 0.725, "pos": 0.208, "compound": 0.9946}, "body": "When Peter Wright first created his production of The Sleeping Beauty for the renovated Birmingham Hippodrome in 1984, it was a significant stepping stone on the way to the Sadler\u2019s Wells Royal Ballet\u2019s move to the West Midlands city, where it became the Birmingham Royal Ballet, a jewel in the crown of the council\u2019s policy of reviving the fortunes of the city through generous support of the arts. How times change. The company\u2019s current artistic director, Carlos Acosta, has mounted a 40th-anniversary revival just as the bankrupt local authority has withdrawn support from all the arts organisations it once part-funded. Birmingham Royal Ballet will survive, but the cut is a sign of how far artistic ambition in national and local government has receded from the high-water mark that this handsome, expansive production represents. Acosta himself still believes; his passion for making his company not only world-class but also accessible and enticing to new audiences is shown as much by this revival as it was by last year\u2019s new commission Black Sabbath: The Ballet. The Sleeping Beauty is a work that puts a company through its paces, offering a workout for the dancers and magic for audiences. Wright\u2019s version is pretty traditional, with the Lilac Fairy and Carabosse, the good and bad fairies, fighting over Princess Aurora\u2019s future, in long dresses and elaborate headdresses. \u201cIt\u2019s Maleficent, only she\u2019s not called that,\u201d one mother explained to her young daughter as Carabosse appeared high on a bier carried by pirate-hatted attendants. In Daria Stanciulescu\u2019s glittering performance, the bad fairy certainly commands attention; poor Eilis Small as her benign counterpart has a disappointing grey gown and rather too much mime to contend with. Many of the costumes are originals, and Philip Prowse\u2019s bronze, gold and deep red designs still gleam as the choreography moves briskly through the story, the dancers rising to its challenges with plenty of commitment and varying degrees of success. In the fairytale final act, Riku Ito and Beatrice Parma shimmered in the Bluebird pas de deux, and Sofia Li\u00f1ares, who shone in various roles throughout, brought a sense of happiness to the celebratory pas de quatre. Yu Kurihara is a very young and pretty Aurora; her nerves sometimes showed as she faced the technical demands of the famous Rose Adagio, but she\u2019s light and lively and was beautifully partnered by Lachlan Monaghan as Florimund, lending feeling and panache to possibly the most thankless prince role in ballet. Someone, though, needs to look at the lighting, which is often unaccountably dark and flat. Perhaps they should talk to Dimitris Papaioannou, the Greek choreographer, whose ability to conjure an entire world of shadows and highlights, of dark and light is once more on display in his latest work, Ink, at Sadler\u2019s Wells in London. Lit in stark contrasts by Lucien Laborderie and Stephanos Droussiotis, it looks utterly sensational, sometimes like a black hole, sometimes a silvery shell, a space surrounded by swathes of transparent plastic and full of water that arches from a jet making its own squelchy soundscape. In this mysterious arena Papaioannou (dressed in black) and the mainly naked \u0160uka Horn grapple for power and control. Horn first appears crawling under sheets of heavy plastic that Papaioannou uses to imprison him like Frankenstein controlling the monster. Perhaps the battle is between id and ego, or wildness and civilisation. There\u2019s also an octopus and a baby. The images tantalise and sometimes terrify, but they don\u2019t always cohere.

The comedian and actor has two Amazon parrots named Michael Parkinson (\u201cParky\u201d) and Eddie McGuire (\u201cEddie\u201d or \u201cEdzy\u201d). \u201cPeople get birds and keep them in cages \u2013 that\u2019s not what they\u2019re there for,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have an exotic parrot, they require a huge amount of work, a lot more work than a dog does. But they\u2019re so worth it. They sing, they dance, they talk \u2026 They\u2019re just really good companions.\u201d When she\u2019s not at home with her birds, the Yidinji woman is busy on stage and screen. Although she\u2019s known for being funny, Tisdell\u2019s breakout screen role was in political drama Total Control. She\u2019s since joined the cast of Bump, and gives a standout performance in comedy series Class of \u201907. She is also moderating a \u201cfeminist roast\u201d at the All About Women festival in Sydney. Here, the funny woman gets serious about her beloved birds, and shares the stories of other important belongings. What I\u2019d save from my house in a fire A drawing my niece did. I have it up on the fridge and love looking at it every day. She made it on a really nice day we spent together when she was seven. We did these drawings of Bluey and then I said to her, what if we made an animal that looked like Bluey, but wasn\u2019t a dog? So we made a Bluey unicorn. My niece reminds me of me as a kid. I was really creative but also quite academic, and I think she\u2019s the same. There\u2019s always a focus on academia, and so I love showing her that you can be creative too. My most useful object I have an ice-cream container that is the most perfect size for my bird food. Actually, even better is the measuring cup that I serve out their food with. My entire life is my birds. You know those people who treat their animals like they\u2019re children? I can\u2019t stand those people. But I\u2019m one of them now! [Before I had to go to Sydney to film Total Control] I went to a place in Brisbane called Northside Produce, because they have heaps of birds \u2013 aviary birds, chickens, all of that, and I saw this little baby Amazon, which they don\u2019t normally have. And he was obsessed with me. As I walked in, he bit a kid, which I thought was funny. But when I went over, he just jumped on me, and it took three staff members to get him off. So I picked him up the next day and we drove to Sydney together. I didn\u2019t feel crazy for talking out loud to him. He got me through the hardest period of my life, and he was there for the biggest thing that had happened in my career to that point. Amazons aren\u2019t solo birds \u2013 they\u2019re the second or third smartest bird species in the world. So I got him a little friend for my birthday, another Amazon. They act like brothers \u2013 they fight. They are best friends. They sing opera. For about an hour every day, we sing songs together. They make me happy. The item I most regret losing An iPod that I had years and years ago \u2013 it must have been 2009. I got mugged on a trip to Jamaica and it was taken. And I had my first love on this trip \u2013 a holiday romance with an English guy. He had downloaded all of his songs on to my iPod, and a lot of songs that were really important to us and explained how he felt about me. We got mugged on our last night and it was because we were canoodling and holding hands \u2013 we were easy prey. But those songs were symbolic of our relationship; my first love.

Completed in 1951, Stravinsky\u2019s ironic Hogarthian parable ranges allusively through operatic history in its exploration of the relationship between indolent Tom Rakewell and demonic Nick Shadow, deploying the formalities of 18th-century opera \u2013 recitative, aria and ensemble \u2013 to distance us from the protagonists even as the music itself exposes their thoughts and feelings with extraordinary poignancy. But where Stravinsky strives for narrative clarity, Graham on occasion tips stylisation towards surrealism, with uneven results. April Dalton\u2019s designs elide Rococo frippery with the distortion of Dal\u00ed, as pictures of eyes and lips materialise on the walls of Mother Goose\u2019s brothel, and bizarre bric-a-brac fills the house where Baba (Lauren Young) lives with Tom (Frederick Jones, unwell on opening night; his understudy, Brenton Spiteri, sang the last two acts from the side of the stage). Some of it is unduly busy. The opening scene between Tom and Anne (Nazan Fikret) now takes place at a May Day festival, during which Tom is already being eyed by Shadow (Jerome Knox), while masked pagan figures, half-human, half animal, dance round a maypole. There\u2019s more maypole later on in the graveyard scene, which proves distracting. Some of it is striking. Casting a younger baritone than usual as Shadow allows her to present the pair as alter egos rather than middle-aged mentor and hapless protege. We\u2019re never quite sure whether or not London is a hell on earth populated by Shadows\u2019s demonic minions, while Bedlam, ironically, seems the only calm place in a world where \u201cgood or bad, all men are mad,\u201d as Baba puts it. Elsewhere, however, Graham\u2019s ideas sometimes don\u2019t quite work. Anne sets out to redeem Tom as a warrior heroine in trousers and chainmail, brandishing a sword like Bradamante in Handel\u2019s Alcina, which comes close to undermining Stravinsky\u2019s depiction of her courage as born of simple goodness. That it does not is due to Fikret, who sings with a wonderfully silvery tone and great depth of feeling throughout. This is one of several superb performances in an evening which, musically, is consistently fine. Knox\u2019s elegant Shadow is all the more dangerous for being so plausibly charming, even when he is at his most malevolent. A couple of moments of wayward intonation apart, Jones didn\u2019t sound as if he was struggling in Act I: Spiteri\u2019s voice is slightly darker, nicely combining weight with lyricism. Young, meanwhile, makes a really fine Baba, funny, self-assured, tellingly compassionate beneath the self-dramatisation. In the pit, Jack Sheen propels the score urgently forwards. It\u2019s beautifully played with some wonderfully precise, elegant instrumental solos, and the choral singing is first rate. \u2022 At Norwich Theatre Royal on 8 March, then touring", "date": "2024-03-03", "section": "Music", "author": "Tim Ashley", "id": 256, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/05e444b753f6bf59876a789d2c037c182bb6b01b/0_175_2740_1644/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Faye Webster: Underdressed at the Symphony review \u2013 petal-voiced power", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/03/faye-webster-underdressed-at-the-symphony-review-nels-cline-lil-yachty", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.038, "neu": 0.709, "pos": 0.253, "compound": 0.9821}, "body": "Thanks to her keen eye, Atlanta singer-songwriter Faye Webster first made waves as a hip-hop photographer. Being school buddies with local rap luminaries helped too. The petal-voiced Webster is now five albums into a body of delicate, powerful work that always captures more than first appears.

The second Dune instalment is jaw-on-the-floor spectacular. It elegantly weaves together top-tier special effects and arresting cinematography; it layers muscle, sinew and savagery on to the bones of Part One. It\u2019s an inhospitable, brutal kind of beauty that Villeneuve has created \u2013 there\u2019s not enough lip balm in the universe to make a visit to the sandblasted wilderness planet of Arrakis look appealing. But this epic action picture, which follows the journey of Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) from a cheeky whippersnapper who\u2019s a bit handy with a sword, to a feared warrior, to the prophesied leader of the Fremen tribe of Arrakis, is realised with a retina-searing intensity. So how is it that Villeneuve has been able to succeed \u2013 and make no mistake, Dune: Part Two is an emphatic success \u2013 in adapting a book that was long considered to be unfilmable? The breadth and scope of Dune, Frank Herbert\u2019s 1965 far-future saga of interstellar feudal conflict, proved a daunting prospect to previous prospective film-makers. The generous budget available to Villeneuve\u2019s pictures certainly helps \u2013 the lack of funds was the factor that sank Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s proposed 14-hour film adaptation of the book in the early 1970s. And studio support is another \u2013 while Warner Brothers hasn\u2019t exactly covered itself in glory recently, as anyone who has been following the Coyote vs Acme debacle will know, it has at least given Villeneuve the space and freedom to achieve his creative vision (compare this with David Lynch\u2019s less happy experience with his version of Dune, originally intended to run at three hours, then unceremoniously hacked down by nearly 40 minutes). But a crucial element in Villeneuve\u2019s approach, a creative ethos that gels particularly effectively with the material, is his firm commitment to showing rather than telling. A chunk of exposition at the very start of the film, delivered as an entry into the \u201cImperial Diary\u2019\u2019 and narrated by Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), neatly proves how futile it is to attempt to unpick the intricacies of this densely plotted chronicle. In this case, too much dialogue and plot explanation drain the energy from the picture; it\u2019s far more effective to employ Villeneuve\u2019s preferred tactic of exploring the story visually. This technique occasionally misfires, with some of the transitions between vividly created scenes and set pieces feeling a little cursory and disjointed. But on the whole, it does no harm at all to bathe the audience in heady, colour-saturated atmosphere rather than to spoon-feed them with easily digestible gobbets of plot. Although Paul is the main focus of the story, this instalment allows other characters to come to the fore, most notably Fremen warrior Chani (an impressive, physically committed performance from the always magnetic Zendaya). But a standout in a supporting role is Austin Butler, playing Feyd-Rautha, the psychopathic nephew of Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s levitating despot, Baron Harkonnen. A vast, seat-shuddering spectacle like this movie is no place for subtlety, and Butler evidently got that particular memo. From the moment he tests the calibre of a freshly sharpened blade with his extended tongue, before trying it on the throat of one of his slaves, he is phenomenal. It\u2019s a gleefully over-the-top performance fuelled by malice and channelled through axe-blade cheekbones and a smile that could strip the skin from your face. Equally impressive and only slightly less disturbing is Rebecca Ferguson, reprising her role of Lady Jessica, Paul\u2019s mother. Driven by her ambition for her son, and twisted by the gruelling ritual that transforms her into the Reverend Mother of the Fremen, Jessica takes on a chilling ruthlessness, something that Ferguson manages to convey almost entirely through an icily inscrutable gaze and a collection of facial tattoos. The immense, breathtaking visuals and the grandstanding performances are more than matched by Hans Zimmer\u2019s behemoth of a score. There are passages so thunderous, it sounds as though he somehow harnessed the noise of colliding planets in place of percussion. It\u2019s a fittingly ominous accompaniment to a story that lurches away from passionate idealism, truth and romance, and towards political machinations, betrayals, zealotry, the weaponisation of fear and the looming threat of a devastating religious war.

Trump has swept the Republican contest so far and maintains a dominant lead across the country ahead of Super Tuesday. Earlier in the race all Republican candidates were required by the Republican National Committee to pledge loyalty to the winning eventual candidate as a requirement to taking part in the party\u2019s televised debates \u2013 which Trump himself refused to participate in. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press show on Sunday Haley acknowledged making the pledge of loyalty but said she did not feel bound by it any more.

Naomi Kendall, an artist based in Somerset, has embarked on several home swaps. She says: \u201cYou can\u2019t be too precious about your home, but equally, you need to feel comfortable with the people you swap with, so you\u2019re not worrying the whole time. You need to think about your neighbours a bit, too. We\u2019ve only swapped with people we knew, or people who were friends of friends.\u201d Find the right platform If you are ready to switch with strangers, platforms such as HomeExchange, HomeLink and Home Base Holidays (which also runs the Guardian\u2019s own website, Guardian Home Exchange) let you list your property, browse places where you would like to stay, and contact the owners to see if they would be interested in swapping with you. These charge an annual fee: at the time of writing, Home Base Holidays charged \u00a349 a year, HomeLink \u00a3120 and HomeExchange \u00a3180. In most cases, no other money will change hands. These platforms offer direct swaps with another homeowner. You get in touch with each other, and if they want to swap with you, you discuss all the details and make a plan that suits everyone. The switch doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be simultaneous \u2013 perhaps you are going away somewhere in August, and the other family comes to stay in your house, then while that family are away in a different destination in October, you go to stay in their empty house. As well as swaps with only two parties involved, HomeExchange has a \u201cGuestPoints\u201d system where you can let people stay in your home when you are away, in return for a number of GuestPoints, then use those points as a credit for a stay in another home at another date. Trust in your house A few platforms \u2013 for example, the US-based site Kindred \u2013 operate an applications system, where they check your home meets its minimum requirements \u2013 for example, wifi, a workspace and \u201ctasteful\u201d decoration. On many platforms, though, you simply tick the boxes to show your facilities, and the process becomes self-regulating, with people opting for swaps that meet their requirements. A lot of people worry they will stay somewhere incredible and their guests will, in turn, be underwhelmed. Your home doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, but do be candid in your descriptions. When creating your listing, clear clutter and make it look as appealing as you can for the photos, but include images of the avocado bathroom suite you plan to update, so there are no surprises. For most platforms you don\u2019t need to own your home, but, says Mark Sealey, the chief executive of Home Base Holidays: \u201cMembers who rent their homes must get an agreement from their landlord or letting agency before listing the property for home swapping.\u201d Sell your area It\u2019s not just about the house \u2013 people want a base from which to explore. Even if you don\u2019t live in a tourist hotspot, mention any places of interest that are within an hour or so\u2019s drive \u2013 cities, national parks, beaches, attractions, anything that might pique people\u2019s curiosity \u2013 and include photos. Tell your insurer The Association of British Insurers (ABI) advises that you speak to your home insurer to see whether a swap would have an impact on your cover. \u201cYour insurer will also be able to advise on what exclusions may be in your policy regarding loss or damage caused by guests,\u201d an ABI spokesperson says. Pikl, an insurer specialising in cover for \u201cthe sharing economy\u201d, is among the firms offering a property host top-up policy suitable for home swapping or Airbnb-style lets if your existing policy is inadequate. Ad hoc cover is available from \u00a32 a day, and cover for up to 30 days in a year is \u00a339.99. It covers fire damage caused by the guests, accidental or malicious damage, as well as public liability up to \u00a32m an event if the guests were to get injured as a result of the house swap. You need permission for the swap from your main insurer for the top-up policy to be valid. Some people swap cars as well as homes. Check whether your motor insurance provider will allow this \u2013 if it does, you may need to provide licence details for the driver and pay extra. Your exchange partner should do the same for you. Sealey says some Home Base Holidays members have split the cost of car rental in cases where insurance policies are too restrictive for one party to borrow a car. Expect charming imperfections One person\u2019s \u201cclean and tidy\u201d is another\u2019s \u201chow do they live like this?\u201d \u201cThe vast majority of places that are swapped are people\u2019s year-round homes, so they are not always going to be perfect,\u201d Sealey says. \u201cOccasionally issues occur because people don\u2019t have the same approach to housekeeping. If your home is immaculate and you need the place you stay in to be the same, ask questions to find out how your potential swapper approaches cleaning.\u201d Be flexible \u201cIf you need to be in Madrid on a certain date in April for a wedding, it might be difficult to find a suitable swap,\u201d says Caroline Connolly, the country manager for HomeLink UK. \u201cBut if you can say \u2018we\u2019d like to go to Spain in the summer\u2019, you\u2019re far more likely to find something that works for you.\u201d When you register, you can specify destinations or leave that open \u2013 some say that being open-minded about locations can lead to more interesting swaps. Connolly\u2019s first-ever swap was to a house in Saint John in New Brunswick, Canada \u2013 a place that she would have struggled to find on a map at the time. \u201cIt turned out to be incredible,\u201d she says. Take your time and ask questions \u201cThe first contact you have with members will be very much feeling things out,\u201d Sealey says. \u201cGive yourself plenty of time to find the right place and build trust with one another.\u201d Ask a lot of questions \u2013 and be prepared to answer them \u2013 and check the address on Google Maps to see if there is something that might be a problem for you, such as road noise or busy city centre nightlife if you are a light sleeper. Phillippa Rose from London and her family have swapped homes several times using HomeExchange, staying in homes in the UK, France and Spain. Rose recommends meeting online before the swap: \u201cI find a live video call really nice, just to get to know the people you\u2019re swapping with, and you can have a virtual show-around, too.\u201d Leave a small welcome pack with information on your home and the area, and consider recording videos to help with any quirks \u2013 for example, if there is a knack to opening the washing machine door. \u201cThe owners in France recorded a video to show how to change the pool filter \u2013 it\u2019s much easier to see how things work on a video,\u201d Rose says. Store your stuff and keep things clean Before the swap, spring clean, clear clutter, and perhaps put away anything particularly breakable or valuable, or your child\u2019s precious Lego creations. Store things in the attic if you have one, or take a box round to a friend or family member\u2019s home. \u201cWe have members who do longer-term swaps, say for three months, and in those cases they might rent storage units,\u201d says Sealey. \u201cWe lock certain things in a cupboard, and we make sure we empty a couple of drawers in the bedrooms for guests to use,\u201d Rose says. Rather than emptying wardrobes containing the family\u2019s clothes, they provide freestanding clothes rails. Aside from one broken lightbulb, she says she has never had any problems with guests. Unless you are very unlucky, your home will be well looked-after, Sealey says: \u201cMost experienced house swappers like to leave the home in as good a state, or even better, than they found it. There is a spirit of respect here: this is someone\u2019s home and they have welcomed you into it, so you should take care of it.\u201d", "date": "2024-03-04", "section": "Money", "author": "Sandra Haurant", "id": 260, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2f041c95f618e1fcf7e6e12f925fa2bb942aa987/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Reading Genesis by Marilynne Robinson review \u2013 a rich, provoking study in luminous prose", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/04/reading-genesis-by-marilynne-robinson-review-a-rich-provoking-study-first-book-of-bible", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.097, "neu": 0.655, "pos": 0.248, "compound": 0.998}, "body": "In an extended dialogue between Marilynne Robinson and Barack Obama, published a few years ago in the New York Review of Books, Obama homes in on the dimension of Robinson\u2019s writing that makes her so unusual as a 21st-century literary figure. \u201cYou\u2019re a novelist,\u201d he observes, \u201cbut you\u2019re also \u2013 can I call you a theologian?

In the epic Gilead series, which brought her a Pulitzer prize and worldwide renown, she probes with gentle but forensic subtlety into the religious preoccupations \u2013 and doubts \u2013 of two fictional midwest pastors. More recently, in collections of essays such as What Are We Doing Here?, she combines theology with cultural commentary to explore what her vision of a Christian humanism might contribute to a politically polarised, divided, 21st-century west. In her latest religious study, Robinson pursues this project by going back to the very beginning \u2013 to Genesis, the first book of the Bible. Most of us have at least a hazy idea of the contents of this ancient text, from God\u2019s creation of the world in six days to the dramatic exiling of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, and the subsequent two-by-two salvage operation of Noah\u2019s ark. Robinson takes it to have been written as a kind of origin story for a liberated nation, after the Israelites\u2019 exodus from Egypt. In luminous prose she challenges a modern reader to understand just how unusual a book Genesis is, pregnant with meaning that stretches to our own day. Robinson illustrates how the ancient Hebrew authors borrowed liberally from the Babylonian mythologies created by their near-east neighbours. But with a crucial distinction. Great narratives such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Enuma Elish feature fickle, rivalrous deities who turn their ruthless gaze on mortals only when it serves their interest. In stark contrast, Genesis portrays a troubled love story between humanity and a divine creator who is described as, extraordinarily, \u201chaving created man in his own image\u201d. The vision of a single omniscient and benevolent God is a staggering new departure in ancient literature, with implications all the way down to design details. In the Garden of Eden, Robinson points out, \u201cthe beauty of the trees is noted before the fact that they yield food\u201d. Here is a world packed with signs of a divine desire that the first humans feel at home. Compared with the surrounding myths on offer, this vision \u201cis from the beginning an immeasurable elevation of status\u201d. It all goes wrong, of course, as a highly ill-advised decision to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil leads to disaster and banishment. Robinson deftly guides the reader through Genesis\u2019s account of how human history proper, red in tooth and claw, gets under way as God tries to keep faith with his errant creations. Seminal episodes such as Cain\u2019s murder of Abel, the razing of Sodom and Abraham\u2019s near-sacrifice of Isaac \u2013 the son the old patriarch waited so long to see \u2013 are interpreted with a novelist\u2019s eye for drama. The sections dealing with Joseph\u2019s treacherous brothers are a psychological tour de force, as this guilt-ridden crew descend into a spiral of angst after selling their father\u2019s favourite son into Egyptian slavery. But the point is that God works in mysterious ways. The brothers\u2019 heinous act later proves providential when Joseph, having become one of the most powerful men in Egypt, is able to rescue the Israelites from famine. By refusing to leave the really ugly human stuff out, Robinson suggests, the ancient scribes produced a book \u201cnot primarily meant to offer examples of virtue or heroism\u2026 but meant instead to trace the workings of God\u2019s loyalty to humankind through disgrace and failure and even crime\u201d. More than two millennia later, beyond the poetic and literary fascination of the text, can this narrative say anything meaningful to a secular mind? Robinson implies that it can, at a gloomy moment when \u201cthe natural order and the social order are fraying together\u201d. In the face of contemporary atrocities, geopolitical strife and the threat of human-made environmental catastrophe, a work championing the goodness of creation and the infinite value of human life can offer a salutary read, calling us to our responsibilities. And in the ancient rabbis\u2019 account of a merciful God who refuses to write his people off in spite of everything, Robinson finds a way to produce a powerful meditation on hope at a time when that virtue is generally in short supply. For many fans of Robinson\u2019s novels, such ruminations may fall outside their conceptual comfort zone. But for devotees of the Gilead series, Reading Genesis also serves as one of the best primers they will get for the theological world of its protagonists, the Reverends John Ames and Robert Boughton. In Gilead, as he senses death approaching, Ames vainly tries to imagine heaven but can\u2019t get past the first base of feeling simple awe for the world he is still in. \u201cEach morning,\u201d he writes in a letter intended to be read one day by his young son, \u201cI\u2019m like Adam waking up in Eden, amazed at the cleverness of my hands and at the brilliance pouring into my mind through my eyes.\u201d In this rich and provoking study, Robinson has masterfully traced that sense of wonder back to its ancient, remarkable source.

But with everything from medical-grade serums to gut-boosting yoghurts filling our shelves the \u201cscience bit\u201d has truly taken over. However, experts warn that more regulation is needed in the beauty and wellness industry to ensure that consumers are aware of genuinely innovative products compared to those selling false claims. Analysts at Kantar put the growing popularity of science-backed beauty and wellness products down to people having more access to information through social media. This has resulted in greater awareness of the benefits of specific ingredients, they say. Dionne Officer, a research analyst at Mintel, said 67% of UK adults wanted beauty brands to provide more scientific validation. Additionally, 36% of all products that claimed to be science-backed in the last five years were launched in the last 12 months Mintel data shows. The value of the gut health industry alone is expected to rise from \u00a341bn to \u00a370bn by 2030. The Zoe nutrition plan, co-founded by the epidemiologist and gut health expert Dr Tim Spector, has more than 130,000 sign-ups since its launch in 2022. The skincare brand Lyma, which is putting its products through doctor-led trials, had a waiting list of thousands when it launched last year. This week, the company, co-created by an accredited plastic surgeon, brings to market a \u00a34,995 medical-grade at-home laser. Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator for McGill University, said consumers were \u201cquick to believe something is good for us if it\u2019s brand new and cutting edge\u201d. He said: \u201cConsumers may have tried a product with yesterday\u2019s molecule in it and been disappointed with the results, but just like with diets, there\u2019s always a fresh new thing to try with the promise that, this time, it will work.\u201d Lyma\u2019s founder, Lucy Goff, whose company boasts its products are based on scientifically backed breakthroughs, says there has long been a fascination with longevity since Greek mythology and recent technological innovations can help improve how the body works. She added: \u201cThe problem is that so many companies and brands have jumped on the well-tech bandwagon when it\u2019s a marketing ploy and this is where the government has to act more responsibly to put consumer benchmarks in place so consumers know what they are buying into, empowering consumers to be educated in what is credible science and what is marketing hype.\u201d The UK government department responsible for the cosmetics laws is the Office for Product Safety and Standards. These laws are enforced by Trading Standards. However, there is no standard around certain claims or rules around what can be dubbed scientifically proven to work. Goff gives the example of the sun cream market, saying that there is a \u201cconsumer benchmark\u201d on the back of the bottle to \u201cshow how well a product will work\u201d but this does not exist for other creams and supplements. \u201cThe benchmark should be not what the company is telling you but what is peer-reviewed science backing that up \u2026 consumers are not educated in this area and brands are manipulating that, and that is what has to stop.\u201d Timothy Caulfield, a research chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta, coined the term \u201cscienceploitation\u201d to describe how brands borrow language from emerging areas of science to market unproven products. He takes the example of a recent boost in interest in \u201cgut health\u201d. While microbiome and gut health is an exciting emerging area, he says, it takes years of research to explore what works and what does not. Dr James Kinross, a senior lecturer in colorectal surgery and consultant surgeon at Imperial College London, says \u201cmost supplements that allege to target the microbiome, don\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cHaving said that, there is lots of good evidence for pro, pre and synbiotics, the problem is accessing this information to make helpful decisions.\u201d Kinross said that the \u201creal problem is that most of these products don\u2019t do what we really need which is to optimise the microbiome for health to prevent disease.\u201d He advises that eating 30g more fibre a day could be the best and simplest way of helping your colonic microbiome. He added: \u201cThe consumer is often asked to spend a lot of money on these products; sometimes as part of a subscription model or sometimes as part of a platform that charges you for the pleasure of handing over all of your data to Silicon Valley. Be very wary of these products.\u201d Kinross invests \u201cin products that have reproducible science, which are cost-effective and those which have an ethical data policy.\u201d Caulfield said consumers should be sceptical of brands even if they are led by scientists or professors because \u201ca lot of academics are under pressure to hype their work up\u201d. He gives examples of stem cell genomics and microbiomes. \u201cThey are exciting areas of science but think how few clinical applications we have,\u201d he said. Caulfield said it was getting harder for customers to distinguish between good and bad products because there was \u201cso much noise\u201d and you could find something that \u201clegitimises\u201d false claims on the internet. His advice is to look for claims that are not clearly explained to avoid products that will not deliver as much as they promise. After all, while times may have changed the old L\u2019Or\u00e9al adage remains, and as Aniston would say, it\u2019s \u201cbecause you\u2019re worth it.\u201d", "date": "2024-03-04", "section": "Fashion", "author": "Sarah Marsh Consumer affairs correspondent", "id": 262, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c901877118f2b9a776bd2a2d57a54bca8d0dca0f/0_155_2000_1200/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Big Bruckner Weekend review \u2013 there\u2019s no escaping the challenges of his music, as well as its pleasures", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/04/big-bruckner-weekend-review-theres-no-escaping-the-challenges-of-his-music-as-well-as-its-pleasures", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.05, "neu": 0.725, "pos": 0.225, "compound": 0.9978}, "body": "Plenty of classical composers have a reputation these days. Some are good \u2013 think of the celebrated jollity of \u201cPapa Haydn\u201d or Beethoven\u2019s tantalisingly struggle-fuelled inspirations. Others are less positive, from Rossini\u2019s image as a workshy tunesmith to Wagner\u2019s as a megalomaniac antisemite. Yet surely no mainstream classical composer is more often dismissed as simply \u201cboring\u201d than Austrian symphonist Anton Bruckner. His symphonies are certainly massive, no matter what you make of the venerable quip that Bruckner recomposed the same one nine times. Of course, one listener\u2019s longueurs are another\u2019s immersive epic \u2013 and this devoutly Catholic, counterpoint-obsessed musician also has his superfans. They were out in force for the Big Bruckner Weekend marking the composer\u2019s 200th anniversary at Gateshead\u2019s Glasshouse International Centre for Music \u2013 one coachload was rumoured to have come all the way from Dorset. But the five concerts were clearly aimed at agnostics and newcomers as well: broadcaster John Suchet did double-duty throughout as MC and hype-man. The thing about back-to-back performances of Bruckner\u2019s last three symphonies \u2013 plus his \u201cGreat\u201d Mass No 3 and his String Quintet \u2013 is that there\u2019s no escaping the challenges of his music, as well as its pleasures. I don\u2019t just mean its marathon duration. While these are all pieces from the XXL rail of the classical wardrobe, most of us would sit for longer through films, plays, operas or sports matches. Unlike any of those, though, Bruckner\u2019s works don\u2019t have in-built narratives to carry you along. Like the joke about Bruckner\u2019s beloved Wagner, alas, there were some beautiful moments in the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra\u2019s opening performance of the Seventh Symphony but some long half-hours. It was clear when the musicians were enjoying the broad sweep of Bruckner\u2019s slow-burn melodies and the trumpets were thrillingly incisive throughout, the tuba a dark shadow across the texture. (The less said about the tuning of the Wagner tubas in this or most other performances this weekend, the better.) That Domingo Hindoyan conducted from memory was a major feat. What was missing, however, was a sense of overall shape and momentum driving through Bruckner\u2019s slabs of thematic material. The finale\u2019s vast orchestral unison landed like a breeze block on a pile of toy bricks: impressive in its way, but dislocated from an already bitty performance. A rendition of the String Quintet by five musicians from the Royal Northern Sinfonia (playing to a home crowd in the petite, in-the-round space of Sage 2) suffered something similar. Bruckner\u2019s only chamber work is full of finicky motivic small-print and, regardless of periodic tuning issues, there was a serious wood-for-trees problem here. The full-sized RNS was more persuasive in Bruckner\u2019s Mass No 3 \u2013 its forces beguilingly intimate, in fact, alongside the combined mega-choir of Durham University Choral Society and the Chorus of Royal Northern Sinfonia. The choral sound was gloriously warm and finely balanced with the RNS by conductor Thomas Zehetmair to create textures of gleaming lucidity. Among the soloists, Elizabeth Watts and Hanna Hipp stood out \u2013 Hipp\u2019s fantastically dark timbre the ideal foil for the bright edges of Watts\u2019s soprano. Only hours later, the 1,640-seater Sage 1 was packed for what turned out to be a Bruckner masterclass: the Eighth Symphony from the Hall\u00e9 under outgoing music director Mark Elder. \u201cWe were a bit worried the piece might be too butch for the hall\u201d, Elder told Suchet afterwards, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t.\u201d No indeed. From the absolute precision of the horn\u2019s first note to the terrifying timpani strokes of the finale, Elder\u2019s ear for detail was matched by the hall\u2019s bright, crystalline acoustic. Barely shifting on the podium, the conductor moved musically from 0 to 60 with the flick of a baton; the string syncopations in the Adagio became a kind of tectonic shifting under the surface; the climaxes were catastrophic. That, I assumed, would be peak Bruckner for the weekend. But Sunday afternoon saw Alpesh Chauhan and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra serve up a Ninth Symphony every bit as compelling. A charismatic, balletic conductor, Chauhan jabbed and scooped at the air in front of him; passages that could have been yet more repetition were held in absolute tension with a poised little finger. Most remarkable, however, was the journey from laid-back sonic beauty in the first movement via an extravagantly off-kilter push and pull in the scherzo to a phenomenally intense third movement, by turns majestic and breathtakingly gentle.

Chalmers said Asean was \u201cthe hope of the side when it comes to two-way trade\u201d.

Trade and investment are a major focus of this week\u2019s special summit in Melbourne, held to mark 50 years since Australia became Asean\u2019s first dialogue partner. But security and great power rivalry between China and the US also loom large. China, like Australia, is not a member of Asean but is a dialogue partner to the regional bloc. Some Asean members have tensions with China over competing maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea, but the regional bloc resists taking sides in the strategic contest between Beijing and Washington. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, warned on Monday that \u201cthe region\u2019s character\u201d was under challenge, including in the South China Sea. In a veiled reference to China, Wong said: \u201cWe face destabilising, provocative and coercive actions, including unsafe conduct at sea and in the air and militarisation of disputed features.\u201d Addressing a maritime cooperation forum at the special summit, Wong called for a regional balance \u201cwhere no country dominates and no country is dominated\u201d and \u201cwhere each country can pursue its own aspirations\u201d. Wong welcomed the resumption of leader-level and military-level dialogue between China and the US as \u201cimportant steps on the path towards stability that the region has called for\u201d. But she said all countries, not just the major powers, must \u201cshape habits of cooperation that sustain the character of our region\u201d. She said all countries should \u201cinsist differences are managed through dialogue, not force\u201d and \u201cinsist that communication never be withheld as a punishment or offered as a reward\u201d. \u201cWe want to support Asean member states to ensure, collectively, we all have the practical tools we need to be able to rapidly and effectively deescalate tensions and crises.\u201d Wong said the government would commit $64m over the next four years to help Asean countries \u201cincrease resilience to coercion and ensure waterways that serve us all remain open and accessible\u201d.

So well, in fact, that it is easy to take for granted. We put the kettle on and know it will boil. Flick a switch and lo, there is light. But with the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, the grid, which we rely on so much in our day-to-day lives, is in need of an upgrade. That\u2019s because it was originally engineered to connect coal and gas-fired power stations that were built on the coal seams running down the centre of the country. But our reliance on fossil fuels is being replaced by renewable sources of energy, which are generated in large part by offshore windfarms, as well as solar. So significant new infrastructure is needed to connect that renewable energy from where it\u2019s generated to where it\u2019s needed by homes and businesses right across the country. National Grid, the company that builds and maintains the UK\u2019s electricity grid infrastructure, has a plan to solve this: The Great Grid Upgrade. Billed as the largest overhaul of the UK\u2019s electricity transmission grid in generations, The Great Grid Upgrade represents a significant shift in infrastructure development, according to Joseph Northwood, director, portfolio development and strategy at National Grid. \u201cOver the next decade we will be undertaking one of the biggest ever infrastructure build outs in the UK, with 17 major onshore and offshore projects to deliver. That is the step change required.\u201d So why is it needed, and how will it touch all our lives? Adding value to the economy National Grid needs to build five times more electricity transmission infrastructure over the next six years than it has constructed over the past three decades \u2013 something that could provide a serious boost to the economy. According to government figures, The Great Grid Upgrade could create as many as 130,000 jobs and contribute up to \u00a311bn to the economy. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just engineering and construction jobs,\u201d says Northwood. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a huge range of skills to deliver these projects from design through to delivery \u2013 chartered surveyors, planners, IT and environmental professionals, procurement specialists, visual designers, project managers, apprentices, and many more.\u201d The wide geographic scope of the upgrades means new jobs will be distributed right across the country. And it\u2019s not just the projects themselves that will stimulate job creation \u2013 connecting more renewables to the grid will see new job opportunities in other areas too, such as solar and wind, as well as the automotive sector (through increasing demand for electric vehicles) and the heat pump market. \u201cIt also creates an opportunity for the UK to put itself on the map as an economy that is leaning into the green energy transition,\u201d says Northwood. \u201cIf we develop those skills in the UK, they can be further utilised by other economies as they go through their energy transition.\u201d Safeguarding national energy security Replacing expensive imported fossil fuels with cheaper, cleaner, domestic sources of energy will prevent the kind of big hikes in our bills we saw after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \u201cWhen you look at energy bills, the bit that fluctuates most is the commodity, because it is a finite resource and it is less secure,\u201d says Northwood. \u201cThe energy transition will bring that volatile component down. That resilience, the security and diversity of supply, is going to be delivered by this infrastructure and we are working hard to deliver a network that enables this, while delivering a secure, diverse mix of clean energy to our hospitals, schools, homes and businesses.\u201d Helping the UK to reach net zero at pace If we\u2019re to achieve net zero by 2050, as the climate emergency requires us to, millions of UK households and many thousands of businesses will need to adopt new technologies. \u201cTechnological evolution and innovation create a demand for energy that has to be catered for,\u201d says Northwood. And these changes could also be good for your finances: the Treasury\u2019s Net Zero Review suggested that the average electricity bill in 2050 for a household with an electric vehicle and a heat pump could be broadly similar or even lower than the average electricity, heat and transport fuel costs for a household in 2019 with an internal combustion engine vehicle and a gas boiler. The electrification of heating, transport and industry is expected to result in a rapid increase in demand: by 2050, we could be using twice as much electricity as we do today. The government has set a target of adding up to 50GW of offshore wind to Britain\u2019s energy mix by 2030 and is also targeting a fivefold increase in solar deployment, to 70GW, by 2035. But we can\u2019t connect these new clean, green sources of supply to the grid without upgrading our electricity infrastructure. Getting new renewable energy projects connected to the grid as quickly as possible will give the UK a much better chance of successfully achieving net zero and bringing bills down. The Great Grid Upgrade is, in that sense, the very foundation of the country\u2019s energy transition. \u201cThe fundamental point of the transition is to sustain and to enhance the environment we live in,\u201d says Northwood, \u201censuring that it is preserved not only for our generation, but generations to come.\u201d Find out more about The Great Grid Upgrade at nationalgrid.com/tggu", "date": "2024-03-05", "section": "The Great Grid Upgrade", "author": "Duncan Jefferies", "id": 266, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1b21718daf6fc4c31162a527967c85dcad26e4a4/0_171_5121_3073/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Why Barbie should win the best picture Oscar", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/05/why-barbie-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.069, "neu": 0.561, "pos": 0.37, "compound": 0.9992}, "body": "If there\u2019s one thing the Oscars are usually sniffy about, it\u2019s a mainstream blockbuster. They may garner nominations but winning is a different matter altogether. But Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, an effervescent comedy about the world\u2019s most famous doll that wraps up a zingy dissection of the patriarchy, women\u2019s lack of power and mortality in a bright bow, is not your standard blockbuster. And that\u2019s exactly why it deserves that best picture Oscar. Meryl Streep wasn\u2019t being hyperbolic when she credited Barbie for saving the film industry and \u201call of our jobs\u201d at this year\u2019s Palm Springs film awards. It became 2023\u2019s highest grossing film and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time after cashing in $1.4bn at the worldwide box office. Barbie swept in like a pastel-hued tsunami through an industry that had been sluggish since the pandemic, with cinemas failing to get as many people through the door as they had pre-Covid. It\u2019s true that the Oscars have never been about box office receipts. But Barbie became a true cultural phenomenon. It resurrected cinema and if that isn\u2019t enough to win a statuette, I don\u2019t know what is. And there\u2019s a good reason why people turned up in droves, dressed up in pink, to watch Barbie and then returned for multiple viewings. That\u2019s because it is a genuinely great film; one of the most offbeat, subversive and surreal blockbusters that we\u2019ve seen in recent times. Barbie\u2019s journey towards self-realisation, when she crosses over into the real world, takes in feminism, sexism and toxic masculinity, but does so in a way that is still playful and always humorous. And most importantly, Barbie is fun. So much fun! Gerwig and Noah Baumbach\u2019s script is stacked with jokes that sparkle as fiercely as Barbie\u2019s gold disco jumpsuit. Surely it merits a win for its sardonic jibe at Zack Snyder\u2019s cut of Justice League alone? And the brilliant ensemble cast, which includes America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, and Michael Cera, look as if they\u2019re having a ball. Their infectious energy beams like a warm glow from the screen. Margot Robbie is the beating heart of Barbie, playing the character with endearing wide-eyed wonder as she grapples with burgeoning self-awareness. While Ryan Gosling throws himself into his role as the lovelorn, eternally sidelined Ken, whose sharply defined abs, love for horses and slick dance moves aren\u2019t quite enough to win her over. It\u2019s one of the funniest performances of 2023, and his \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d dance number, a homage to Singin\u2019 in the Rain, is just sublime. For all its strengths, let\u2019s not kid ourselves that Barbie is anything but an outsider when it comes to best picture. Barbie may have successfully overthrown a patriarchal revolution from the Kens in Barbie Land, but the Academy is an even harder institution to shake up. I worry that Barbie is emitting some serious \u201cKenergy\u201d as a contender; despite supporting the industry so handsomely financially, it\u2019s not really being taken that seriously. Some have noted how it plays out more like an extended advert for Mattel. But as Barbie\u2019s success shows, you should never underestimate it; beyond its good looks (Those gorgeous costumes! Those incredible sets!) and high-spirited charm, it\u2019s an endlessly inventive, smart and daring comedy tour de force that is more than worthy of any awards. So, even though it\u2019s likely to be Oppenheimer announced on the night, I hope that the Academy realises that it\u2019s time to trade in gold statuettes for plastic dolls and celebrate the film that brought much-needed joy, laughter and crowds back to the cinema.", "date": "2024-03-05", "section": "Film", "author": "Ann Lee", "id": 267, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/119aaca74003496de85459065c0eb362e657c377/258_0_2378_1428/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Hungary will oppose Mark Rutte\u2019s Nato candidacy, foreign minister says \u2013 as it happened", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/mar/05/european-defence-sector-funding-strategy-ukraine-europe-latest-updates", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.081, "neu": 0.703, "pos": 0.217, "compound": 0.9995}, "body": "Estonia, France and Poland issued a call for \u201curgently\u201d increasing Europe\u2019s defence readiness.

Mathieu Droin, a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us that the new European Defence Investment Strategy \u201cmight not be the silver bullet to solve the structural issues of the European defense industrial base, but it is a very positive development.\u201d \u201cIt sends important messages,\u201d he said. First to Ukraine and Russia, that EU military support for Ukraine is here to stay, and to expand. It is not a magical spell that puts the European industrial base \u2018in a war footing\u2019, on par with Russia, but it tells that Europe stands ready for a long war of attrition and to ultimately prevail over Russia. Second to the United States that, amid transatlantic uncertainties, Europeans are serious about taking their share of the burden, while giving a sense of European agency by complementing NATO\u2019s motto of \u2018spending more\u2019 with an injunction to \u201cspend better, together, and European\u201d. And, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a message to member states to finally get their acts together.\u201d As always success lies in the conversion from strategy to policies, and the EU has an uneven track record in this regard (cf. PESCO, Strategic Compass, Versailles agenda, etc.). Without sticks, it needs its carrots to be very attractive to get industries moving. As it stands, the goals set for 2030 seem ambitious (35% of intra-EU defense trade, 50% of EU procurement, 40% of collaborative procurement), but it is always better to start with a good level of ambition. The Hungarian foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, said today in a press conference that his country would not support Mark Rutte, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, as Nato\u2019s next secretary-general. Rutte, a longtime head of government, has already won the endorsement of Nato\u2019s biggest members. The Netherlands has over the past years been among the EU countries most vocal about concerns regarding democratic backsliding in Hungary. In 2020, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, quipped: \u201cI don\u2019t know what is the personal reason for the Dutch prime minister to hate me or Hungary.\u201d And in a particularly tense summit in 2021, when tensions rose among leaders over a Hungarian anti-LGBT law, Rutte said Hungary must respect fundamental rights or leave. \u201cMy goal is to bring Hungary to its knees on this issue,\u201d he said at the time. Today, the Hungarian foreign minister appeared to refer back to these comments. \u201cWe certainly can\u2019t support the election of a person to the position of NATO\u2019s secretary general, who previously wanted to force Hungary on its knees,\u201d Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said. Speaking in Prague today, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said \u201cwe are certainly approaching a moment in our Europe where it will be appropriate not to be a coward,\u201d Reuters reported. He also said France and the Czech Republic were \u201cwell aware that war is back on our soil (in Europe), that some powers which have become unstoppable are extending every day their threat of attacking us even more, and that we will have to live up to history and the courage that it requires.\u201d Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at Bruegel, has shared with us his first impressions of the new European Defence Industrial Strategy. \u201cAs usual it is a mix of aspiration and some concrete measures,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a start, it is great that the EU Commission is putting forward a strategy. Europe gets way too little effective defence for how much it spends. European defence industry is fragmented and economies of scale are low,\u201d he said. Wolff also noted that \u201ca lot of defence equipment is bought abroad \u2013 with relatively little domestic production left. In the short term, Europe will need to continue to procure and buy globally as the domestic capacities to produce are still too limited to satisfy the needs of Ukraine. But domestic production is increasing \u2013 and needs to increase further.\u201d Addressing the Commission\u2019s aim to have a certain percentages of defence industrial production to be completed within the EU, Wolff said: While I have been very sceptical of such targets in the EU\u2019s green industrial strategy, I am more open to it in the case of defence. After all, this is a core area of sovereignty where foreign dependencies may be real security vulnerabilities. But he also that the proposed European Defence Industry Programme \u201clooks like a disappointing instrument to shore up domestic production in the short term.\u201d The planned \u20ac1.5 billion for 2025-27, he said, \u201cis very small compared to defence spending and unlikely to have a big impact.\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission\u2019s executive vice president, acknowledged at the press conference that \u201c1.5 billion is not a lot of money when it comes to the defence industry \u2013 but it can still work as an incentive, as a bonus, as what makes member states come together.\u201d She added: \u201cThe real funding for a stronger defence comes from member states. And that funding will increase over the years to come. So what we can do here is to enable that funding to be spent in a better way, that we get more value for money, and that more relatively speaking is being spent in Europe as well.\u201d \u201cWith war on our borders, if not now, then when?\u201d she said. Thierry Breton, the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, has emphasised that boosting Europe\u2019s defence industrial base is of \u201cexistential\u201d importance and that the issue of financing will have to be discussed. The European Investment Bank should change the way it works, he argued, to underpin the investments for production and development in the defence sector. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president who is expected to get a second term after June\u2019s EU election, said that the defence industrial strategy presented today \u201cwill support Member States to not only spend more, but better, together and European.\u201d It will also \u201clink Ukraine\u2019s know-how with our defence industry to facilitate innovation,\u201d she said. Speaking to reporters, the internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said that there is no talk of taking away from member states competencies on defence and that there is no talk of changing the EU Treaties. Along with the new strategy, the Commission has proposed a European Defence Industry Programme to \u201cbridge from short-term emergency measures, adopted in 2023 and ending in 2025, to a more structural and longer-term approach to achieve defence industrial readiness,\u201d the Commission said in a statement. The programme will mobilise \u20ac1.5 billion of the EU budget for 2025-2027. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, said during the presentation of the Commission\u2019s new strategy that \u201cpeace is no more a given\u201d and \u201cthe Russia war of aggression has brought a great sense of urgency to step up our industrial defence capacities.\u201d The European Commission has now presented its new European Defence Industry Strategy and a proposal for a European Defence Industry program. Speaking to reporters, Margrethe Vestager, the Commission\u2019s executive vice-president, said the move is designed to \u201crespond to the changes of Europe\u2019s security paradigm.\u201d The Commission said the new strategy is aimed at \u201csupporting a more efficient expression of the Member States\u2019 collective defence demand\u201d as well as \u201csecuring the availability of all defence products\u201d and \u201censuring that national and EU budgets support with the necessary means the adaptation of the European defence industry to the new security context.\u201d Goals also include \u201cmainstreaming a defence readiness culture across policies, notably by calling for a review of the European Investment Bank\u2019s lending policy this year\u201d and \u201cdeveloping closer ties with Ukraine through its participation in Union initiatives in support of defence industry and stimulating cooperation between the EU and Ukrainian defence industries.\u201d The Commission\u2019s plan also sets new indicators to measure progress. These include procuring \u201cat least 40% of defence equipment in a collaborative manner by 2030\u201d and \u201cmake steady progress towards procuring at least 50% of their defence procurement budget within the EU by 2030 and 60% by 2035.\u201d The EU is proposing its first ever EU defence industrial strategy today in an urgent bid to rebuild capacity to fend off potential future attacks from Russia. The move will mark the end of post-war peacetime defence strategy in Europe which has seen production of ammunition and battlefield hardware such as tanks being wound down. It also comes five years after Emmanuel Macron suggested a European army and after recent warnings by the French president and others that the EU had to become independent in its defence particularly with the prospect of Donald Trump coming to office in November. Officials at the European Commission said they were able to \u201cremedy\u201d the lack of a defence policy in the last two years but had identified three gaps, including a large financial black hole. Officials calculated that if the bloc had spent 2% of its GDP on defence in the last 15 years it would have spent \u20ac1trn. \u201cThis gives an idea of the financial realisation\u201d that is needed, said an insider. Immediate funds it is hoping to secure on joint agreement of member states is \u20ac1.5bn but defence commissioner Thierry Breton has talked about the need for a budget of \u20ac100bn. Officials said the new strategy was \u201cground breaking and adds quite considerable ambition\u201d to the hastily put together defence strategy that has been put in place in the wake of Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine and largely dominated by bigger states such as Germany in bilateral contributions. The strategy is also designed to give defence manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere the commercial confidence there will be orders in place long beyond the end of the war in Ukraine. The EU has recently been criticised by Ukraine for missing a target of supplying 1m rounds of ammunition by spring. This is now expected to be met at the end of the year. Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the Guardian this morning that \u201cthis is a very important moment for not just the EU but for NATO and European security.\u201d \u201cEuropean defence is in a disastrous state not just because European countries don\u2019t spend enough but because they don\u2019t coordinate their spending,\u201d he said. Bergmann added: This means European defence is far less than the sum of its parts. The EU can therefore play a critical role in doing what the EU does best: breaking down barriers to cooperation and getting Europeans to actually coordinate on what they buy. NATO doesn\u2019t do this and the end result is a bunch of European militaries that struggle to deploy and fight together. But like some EU capitals, he also cautioned about the question of money. The big issue though is funding. 1.5 billion euros is not going to cut it. The EU has to incentivise cooperation and needs 10x that. The most logical way forward is for the EU to just borrow the damn money through Eurobonds. It\u2019s stunning that Estonia and Poland are supportive. The key obstacle is Berlin though, which seems opposed to any funding at the EU level, which is astonishingly shortsighted. The European Commission will hold a press conference to present the new European Defence Industrial Strategy and European Defence Industry Programme. Stay tuned for updates. The European Commission is set to present today its new European Defence Industrial Strategy. The move comes at a time when Ukraine is experiencing a serious ammunition shortage, and as European countries grapple with the question of what Donald Trump\u2019s possible return to the White House could mean for both Kyiv and transatlantic security commitments. But while for the most part there is agreement in Europe that it needs to step up on defence, and that defence production needs to urgently be ramped up, there are still divergences in views on how to get there \u2013 and in particular on how to fund new defence efforts. The strategy unveiled today is thus expected to be one milestone in a long policy debate. Estonia, France and Poland have issued a call for \u201curgently\u201d increasing Europe\u2019s defence readiness. In a document seen by the Guardian, the three countries outlined their priorities for the new European Defence Industrial Strategy. \u201cWe must ensure that the ambition of the Strategy is proportionate and backed by concrete actions that support our combat capability,\u201d they said, adding: \u201cwe are in a race against time.\u201d The three countries said the strategy should aim to: \u2022 Improve the long-term capacity of EU defence industry to provide for the needs of our armed forces, reduce strategic dependencies, and enhance the ability to scale up production quickly in times of crises; \u2022 Support a fundamental increase in Member States\u2019 levels of battle-decisive munition stocks, availability of key weapon systems and other capabilities across domains; \u2022 Enhance the EU\u2019s and its Member States\u2019 competitive edge in (military and dual-use) technology and innovation, including by removing bottlenecks, securing supply chains, and improving access to growth finance; \u2022 Strengthen cooperation with and encourage Ukraine\u2019s participation in its defence industrial initiatives. They also warned about the need for sufficient funding to go with ambitious goals. We call upon the Commission to present concrete funding options, especially for the period leading up to the next [long-term EU budget]. Inadequate funding now will only mean higher expenditure at a later date. The Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said this morning that \u201cwe have to unlock the potential of the European defence industry.\u201d We must learn lessons from the war in Ukraine and invest in the security of Europeans, fight fragmentation by joint arms procurement and promote cross-border production. The defence sector must have access to significant public and private finance and investment. She also reiterated a call for the creation of a dedicate defence commissioner in the next European Commission. Good morning and welcome back to the Europe blog. Today we will be looking into Europe\u2019s latest discussions on how to boost defence \u2013 and in particular the production of weapons and ammunition.

Pinned up next to my sixth-form college whiteboard, the neatly coloured timetable told me that the AS literature group were next. They milled around outside the classroom, brimming with nervy start-of-term small talk: how vast the site was compared with the various secondary schools they\u2019d said goodbye to a few months ago; stuttered lists of subject choices. I opened YouTube on my monitor, increased the volume and beckoned the students in. Twenty bemused kids made their way to their seats as I clicked to the beat at my desk, before rising to my feet to offer a laid-back two-step. I got a quizzical thumbs up; one brave soul testingly called out: \u201cYeah, funky, sir?\u201d As they peeled out of their box-fresh hoodies, Fela Kuti\u2019s Water No Get Enemy strolled towards its chorus. Playing \u201ccool tunes\u201d as students filed in was one of many gimmicks I used at the start of my teaching career, all of which now seem utterly laughable. But back in 2011, I was a bushy-tailed, 26-year-old newly qualified teacher (NQT), thrilled to have my first job at an \u201coutstanding\u201d college in genteel Surrey. I was keen to be one of those maverick, anti-authoritarian English teachers. Riding high on the idealism of my PGCE course (one of our more memorable seminars was on \u201cTeacher as clown\u201d), I wanted my democratic classroom to be an extension of the students\u2019 common room: a place for relatable but fiery intellectual debate. Informality and eccentricity were to be mainstays of my approach, too. I referred to my students as \u201cmy lambs\u201d, I playfully called myself \u201ctheir shepherd\u201d, and sheep puns were scattered throughout their worksheets. We played elaborate versions of bingo to help memorise literary terms. I only just managed to stop myself dressing up as a wizened matriarch to better deliver a lecture on Lorca\u2019s The House of Bernarda Alba. The students were remarkably tolerant and humoured my efforts. These flourishes might have been seen as a little odd, but they weren\u2019t wildly out of place: the college\u2019s spirit was fairly open, progressive. The head of classics had the classroom above mine and she cried whenever she read Homer aloud to her classes. Teachers were referred to by their first names, dress codes for staff were relaxed: scuffed Converse abounded. We English teachers were given autonomy in terms of text choices and how we explored them. Initial analyses of characters in King Lear often centred on the question: in your opinion, which of the three sisters would be most fun on a night out? With all that freedom, I was very much at home. And I soon sensed that students felt at home with me, too. At break times, the ambitious ones were relaxed when talking to me about their intractable perfectionism. The perennially disorganised ones shared their frustrations about always being on the back foot. My goal was to be nonjudgmental as we solved problems together and \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 to perhaps even make the kids laugh. Teacher as compassionate clown, perhaps. But I was not so comfortable or at home that I was able to tell my students I was gay. Even when studying The Picture of Dorian Gray, where discussion of my own, personal thoughts about Wilde\u2019s experience of outsiderhood might actually have been pertinent \u2013 illuminating, even \u2013 I kept shtum. * * * Even though I had come out to my English department colleagues, I never talked to them about this particular reticence, this fear of speaking freely with my classes. Strange, given that we were a pretty collegiate bunch, staffroom chat veering between updates on The Archers, family strife and triumphs, Yeats\u2019s tangled love life, sweary but precise takedowns of Gove\u2019s Gradgrindian vision. Strange, given that I felt so warmly towards them, these more experienced teachers who were sharing so much with me about how to survive successive weeks with 30 hours of lessons and 20 hours of marking. From the vantage point of 2024, when the Equality Act supposedly legislates against discrimination for a person\u2019s sexual orientation, and popular culture \u2013 Heartstopper, Sex Education \u2013 represents the classroom as a queer-friendly space, my reticence seems archaic, incongruous. I\u2019m disappointed in my former self, too. Isn\u2019t our aim as teachers not just to impart knowledge or to get young people through exams, but to model positive adult behaviours \u2013 like self-belief and pride? At the time, I was deeply frustrated about this for other reasons, too; angry about the unspoken imperative often placed on queer people to repeatedly \u201ccome out\u201d in each new social context, as if we owe this information to those around us; as if this self-revelation is always an easy and untroubling thing to do. While it was galling, I also understood my hesitation. Perhaps, I thought, there was something inherently pragmatic about the choice to keep sexuality private. Why did students need to know about teachers\u2019 personal lives? Where was that a requirement on any mark scheme? I had no precedent for how to have these sorts of conversations with pupils. When I had been at school in the late 90s and early 00s, no teacher ever told us they were gay. Section 28 of the Local Government Act, which prohibited the \u201cpromotion\u201d of homosexuality in schools was only repealed in 2003 \u2013 the year I did my A-levels. And I don\u2019t think my teachers should have felt compelled to reveal their sexuality \u2013 indeed, the National Education Union suggests to its LGBTQ+ members that the decision to come out at work \u201cis yours and yours alone\u201d. Still, there were frenzied whisperings about a couple of science teachers. When I was in year 9, the arrival of a young maths teacher who favoured unfeasibly tight trousers heralded playground speculation about his sexuality, but nothing more than that. On some level, I reckon that, for me, a version of internalised homophobia was at play. Some deeply held, inner sense absorbed from the world around me that my gayness, in the classroom context, was inappropriate and unprofessional. A fear that, once \u201crevealed\u201d, it would undermine me and become the sole focus of students\u2019 interactions with me. I would be \u201cthat gay teacher\u201d, and nothing more. * * * Five years later, I found myself teaching in a very different setting: a south London sixth-form college euphemistically described in some quarters as \u201cvibrant\u201d and in others as \u201cchallenging\u201d. Nominally, it was a Roman Catholic college. A little crucifix was nailed to the wall of every classroom, often flipped and made wonky by lively jokers as they sauntered out of lessons. Many of the students had been on free school meals at their previous schools. Something like 50 different languages were spoken across the predominantly Black student body. It was rated as \u201crequires improvement\u201d by Ofsted in 2017, a year after I joined the staff. I arrived with my kooky shepherd shtick, but there was no perky lambiness about this lot. Initially, my buoyancy and bags of brightly coloured tricks were met with scowls at best. It didn\u2019t take me long to understand why. The majority of my lessons were for GCSE resits. A lot of the kids in these groups had attempted the English exam three or four times and not reached the threshold grade C. Most of them had studied Of Mice and Men so often that they could recite whole chunks of it with glazed eyes. And here I was, serving up the same tired old stuff that no amount of bells and whistles could redeem. Their ire for Curley\u2019s wife knew no bounds. I did not blame them. Praise is a powerful thing. I should have recognised it sooner, but it became clear that what many of these young people were lacking was acknowledgment of their achievements \u2013 in whatever form they took. So, however exhausted or bored I was with trotting out tasks about differences between \u201ctheir\u201d and \u201cthere\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d, I made a point to incorporate some tiny sense of congratulation. Perhaps the group had been quieter than they were last week. Perhaps they\u2019d been more vocal \u2013 more responsive to questions. Maybe someone had spoken sensitively about Lennie\u2019s dialogue. Whatever good I could see and that felt important, I tried to acknowledge. And, even if they found it a little corny, the understanding that I was actively looking for goodness, that I wasn\u2019t just another person loudly putting them down, enabled the beginnings of rapport between me and some of the more willing students. Even so, the seemingly difficult business of my coming out to students remained. This time, the issue was complicated by race. As a Black gay man, then in my early 30s, I had had countless experiences of covert and overt homophobia from my community. At the barber\u2019s I went to in Brixton, I clenched and winced each time a fellow customer called someone a \u201cbattyman\u201d. The slur passed entirely unremarked on \u2013 in fact it was usually accompanied by gales of approving laughter. And, not far from that barber\u2019s, I had had stones thrown at me by homophobes from a car window (I don\u2019t know why they picked me out). So I was wary of talking to my largely Black classes, who were merciless with each other about things as ridiculous as a misremembered Rihanna lyric, about something that seemed as sensitive and incendiary as my sexuality. Then came a moment where something shifted. After a session with my fizzy English language group had ended, one of the students walked back into the room. What had she forgotten? It was lunchtime. I had four million things to do, I was at my desk sorting out my next PowerPoint, dashing off emails, writing reports, gobbling the canteen\u2019s speciality: a pallid ham sandwich. This ambling student, let\u2019s call her Annie, was chatting loudly on her mobile \u2013 totally against college rules \u2013 as she blithely trotted through the door and approached me. Annie mouthed a \u201cSorry\u201d, indicating with a finger that I should wait a minute. I rolled my eyes, crossed my arms. She moved the phone from her ear and met my eyes: \u201cYou\u2019re gay, innit, sir?\u201d There was something disarming about the directness. I blinked, swallowed a hunk of bread, nodded. \u201cCos I\u2019m just chatting to my friend, he\u2019s Nigerian \u2013 you\u2019re Ghanaian, innit sir?\u201d I nodded again. \u201cHe\u2019s basically about to tell his parents, and I was just saying to him he should, because it\u2019ll be completely OK \u2013 because you\u2019re completely OK, innit sir?\u201d I nodded again \u2013 at her, at the sandwich. Annie thanked me and bounded off, utterly unfazed. I was in shock. Angry, too, that I had been caught so off-guard and that the opportunity to decide how I would raise the issue been taken from me. Surely Annie was going to tell all the other kids? And surely any frail cordiality would be replaced by chaos \u2013 lessons were going to be impossible, unbearable now? * * * The next day, I began my class with Annie\u2019s group \u2013 a rather technical session about toddlers\u2019 tentative first attempts at speech \u2013 feeling pretty tentative myself. But the gossiping I expected did not materialise. Annie seemed to pay much more attention than she usually did. She worked hard, and not once did she even think to scrabble in her bag for her phone. It strikes me now that this was a missed opportunity. Not just to speak openly about myself, but to have a broader conversation about sexuality, and to stand against any homophobia that might come. A door had been opened. What stopped me from walking through and moving forward? Some intuition that I shouldn\u2019t go too far and that, on this occasion, I\u2019d had a lucky escape. This anxiety followed me to my next teaching appointment. This third school, in 2017, had me leaping into a different milieu once again. It was a highly selective, fee-paying girls\u2019 school in west London. I was doing a maternity cover and had been given, among other things, a sixth-form tutor group to look after. As this was an independent school, the class was tiny \u2013 only 10 students. They were fantastic, wise beyond their years, but prodigiously silly, too: for me, an ideal combo. Interesting, chatty, inquisitive, they came to me every morning, for a least 45 minutes, at registration. Those conversations were often the highlights of my day. The girls steered me through the social peculiarities and history of this particular school, beaming as they regaled me with tales of errant head girls and questionable RE teachers. They were weirdly obsessed with Abba and musical theatre, and introduced me to a phenomenon called RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, which I hadn\u2019t a clue about before their hyperactive recommendations. As they sorted out their Ucas forms, I shared stories of my own university high jinks. I was open with them about the strangeness of being in this world of extreme privilege after my last job. There was a lot of interest in my writing, the nervous wait for the publication of my first novel. At parents\u2019 evenings, their mothers and fathers talked about how lucky their daughters felt to have me as a form tutor. My ego did somersaults. Despite all this, I again drew the line at talking to them about my gayness, and more specifically the fact that I was now engaged to my partner of a decade. This was in spite of there being a few happily \u201cout\u201d teachers at the school, an institution that prized itself on its liberal ethos. Again the intersection of race and sexuality had something to do with my keeping quiet. At the time, I was the school\u2019s only Black member of teaching staff. Because of \u201ccolour-blindness\u201d, fear of causing offence, not wanting to be seen as focusing exclusively and detrimentally on my Blackness, I\u2019m not sure, but my racial difference was never meaningfully acknowledged by my colleagues in my early days there. To be fair, I didn\u2019t raise it, either. This conspicuous silence made me feel as if my Blackness was enough of an awkward aberration. I didn\u2019t want to mark myself out any more by bringing my queerness into lessons. Besides, I was otherwise, to use Annie\u2019s assessment, \u201ccompletely OK\u201d. Settled and liked and doing well in a well-paid role. A permanent position was very much on the cards. What was the hardship in not telling the kids about my wider life? It didn\u2019t matter all that much. * * * Christmas parties are always decisive, aren\u2019t they? At my first festive bash at the school, the flamboyant drama assistant and I had a shouty conversation on the dancefloor about the sexiness of the gay romance in the film God\u2019s Own Country. We talked, too, about students we both taught \u2013 listing off names, comparing notes. He\u2019d had some rehearsals with a few of the girls in my tutor group. He wondered if I had come out to them. I said no. Embarrassment pricked my cheeks as I registered his surprise. He spoke about how he had discussed his sexuality with his sixth formers, and how much he had enjoyed giving advice to the school\u2019s LGBTQ+ society. Comparatively, I felt like a \u201cbad gay\u201d. I talked about my reservations. While he listened empathetically, he also asked me to consider how much it might mean to a possibly queer student in my group to hear me \u2013 someone they looked up to and respected \u2013 speaking honestly about myself. He asked me to imagine what it would have been like for me at school if a gay teacher had opened up about themselves. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what difference that scenario would have made to me. But it would have been an important part of my path towards understanding and delighting in my gayness. The next morning, I had my last registration of the term with my tutor group. They were singing Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas Is You and getting themselves in a tizzy about the year 12 secret Santa. Mutterings about university acceptance letters expected in early January were feverish. I asked them about their Christmas plans. They wanted to know mine. The conversation with the drama assistant was still with me \u2013 rallying and comforting. Maybe it was the festive hangover, or the last-day-of-term devil-may-care spirit, but I told them I was spending Christmas day itself with my partner\u2019s family. It was sure to be a noisy affair because his family was so large. \u201cHe\u2019s one of seven brothers \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely mad,\u201d I told them. They registered the pronoun. It hung in the air between us. The girls looked at each other, warmly. What I remember most about that aside that morning, and the quiet seconds that followed, was how natural it all felt. Despite it being years in the making, and the subject of so much agonising, there was no sense of effortful force or adrenalised fear. No huge sense of release or relief, either. Only a lightness and absolute ordinariness to the moment, to their silent smiling. I was smiling, too. Curious about what, if anything, might happen next. Pleased, yes, that as the drama assistant had said, I might now be able to offer solidarity to students in need. But mostly proud, now, to be shepherding myself. \u2022 Michael Donkor\u2019s novel Grow Where They Fall is published by Fig Tree (\u00a316.99).

Bradley, who was born in Russia to the same litter as Viking\u2019s mother, is nine years old and a semi-retired multi-champion of dog shows overseas and in Australia. \u201cI fell in love with Bradley when I saw that photo of him as a baby in the snow and had to own him,\u201d breeder Paulene Andrews said. Andrews, who has been a registered dog breeder in Tamworth for 26 years, co-owned Bradley until he was old enough to safely travel to Portugal, where he gained multiple titles before moving permanently to Australia to continue his show career. It was down under that Bradley won best in show over three consecutive years \u2013 2018, 2019 and 2020 \u2013 gaining his Australian supreme championship.

Or as Brand put it, \u201clike a classic car collection\u201d. \u201cWhen you see people out there on the weekend with their cars that they\u2019ve spent hours and hours of work on \u2026 It\u2019s a bit like us breeders. It\u2019s a passion and we put a lot into breeding certain lines and trying to produce the best of the best and then we go out and compete against other people from other kennels.\u201d Australian shepherds have become extremely successful in the show ring because of their \u201ceye-catching colours\u201d and \u201ceffortless, powerful movements\u201d, Brand said. They are built to do some herding, have a little bit of guarding instinct, are a loyal companion and should be able to work all day, Brand said, but also are beautiful to look at. Andrews agreed: \u201cThey are just stunning dogs and their temperament is just so well behaved. \u201cThey are also an extremely smart dog that wants to please you all the time. They really are soft dogs.\u201d The colours of Australian shepherds vary from blue merle and red merle (patterned colours) to black and red. Viking, who won the top prize, is a blue merle. Contrary to their name, Australian shepherds are not originally from Australia. It is widely believed they come from the US, where they were bred as sheepdogs to work on ranches, but other accounts suggest a more complicated lineage. Shirley and Jeff Ford are recorded as the first to reintroduce the breed to Australia in the 1990s, when they emigrated from England. By January 1994, the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) officially recognised the Australian shepherd, which are now one of the largest in the working dog group. Herding and working dogs are having a moment. Messi the dog \u2013 a seven-year-old border collie in Justine Triet\u2019s Anatomy of a Fall \u2013 stole the show at Oscars on Sunday night when he sat among the industry\u2019s best to cheer on the winners of the night. Andrews\u2019 Australian shepherds like to \u201crun around in the morning, play, get fed and then they\u2019re not that active all day\u201d. She has bred them that way so they make better pets. \u201cWhat\u2019s a bit disappointing in this country is, after Covid, people bought Australian shepherds off people who were obviously back yard breeding and don\u2019t know the genetics or required health tests for quality and safe breeding.\u201d Dog breeders in NSW must pass an examination based on the upkeep of dogs, the breeding of dogs and then premises are inspected to see if you are suitable enough to rear a litter, Brand said. After the Crufts competition, organisers said \u201cthe health and welfare of dogs at our show is our priority\u201d.

What\u2019s your view? Catupatree That was one of my first jobs out of drama school. I think Anthony Hopkins was brilliant. I\u2019d like to know when that quote was from. When we were filming it, I was only 20 years old and having the time of my life in Tahiti with 200 gorgeous extras. I know that Anthony had problems with Roger Donaldson, the director. I don\u2019t know whether it was artistic \u2013 I was enjoying myself too much to pay attention \u2013 but in my opinion it ended up being a really good film. They must have patched things up because they went on to do The World\u2019s Fastest Indian together. I\u2019d be interested to know what Tony \u2013 as he\u2019s known to the glitterati \u2013 thinks of it now. You grew up in care homes. Does the story of I Am Urban resonate with your own experiences? Sirriv69 Very much so. It\u2019s a story we see over and over \u2013 the neglect of children by parents who have addiction problems and find it difficult to operate in society. All of that resonates. I was in care, whereas in I Am Urban, the boy is passed around between care homes and foster parents. If you\u2019ve been in care, it\u2019s almost like having been in the army. There is a camaraderie with other people who have experienced it to whatever degree. I\u2019ve always felt it wasn\u2019t that bad for me. You had certain freedoms taken away from you, but I\u2019ve more than made up for it in adult life. I always had my eye on the future, something which is taken away from some of the people in I Am Urban. So it did resonate very heavily. Hunting Venus was great. Did you enjoy being a woman and how difficult did it prove during filming? Prestonian79 It was difficult from the start. I had to be in makeup at 4am because it was a full prosthetic. I was pretty slim at the time, 32 waist, but the corset brought it down to something crazy like 22 or 24in, so it was really uncomfortable. When I took it off at the end of the day, I could feel my organs all slipping back into place. Walking in heels also made me empathise. But playing a woman was great. I had men \u2013 these big, big hairy grips \u2013 flirting with me on set. At one point I had to tell people to keep their hands off my breasts. I said: \u201cI know they\u2019re not real, but they\u2019re still mine.\u201d After filming, I asked if I could keep them but I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with them so I used them as doorstops. Then the silicone started to deteriorate and stain my carpet, so they ended up in the recycling. How do you feel about not being asked to voice the lead in the forthcoming Bob the Builder movie? If Anthony Ramos mucks it up, and producer Jennifer Lopez calls and says: \u201cIs it to late to repair the damage?\u201d what would you say? Paul_Rangecroft I\u2019d say: \u201cWell, my price has now gone up, Jenny.\u201d I\u2019ve no idea what this movie is going to be. Stop-frame animation? CGI? Jenny, get on the phone and let\u2019s have a little chat. I was chatting to Kate Harbour, who plays Wendy, the other day. We said that the entire original Bob crew should at least be invited to the British premiere. It was a labour of love. When we started, they were making it in a 12 x 8ft studio, and it would take a month to animate 10 minutes. By the end, we had a warehouse in Manchester with more than 200 animators, making 12 seconds per team a day. God bless Peter Orton, the original producer, who died. Then it was picked up by a big US toy company and became about making toys, as opposed to the lovely cottage industry of how it started off. So I could at least teach JLo some of the history. Do you find it gratifying that you have had two UK No 1 singles, while Morrissey has had none? VerulamiumParkRanger Poor bloke. I do actually feel gratified. It was a turn in my career I never expected. I ended up vicariously on Top of the Pops, even though it was a Bob animation. But listen, Morrissey is still making music, so he can keep trying. Boon was just brilliant. So many talented people. What was it like working with Michael Elphick? Could it ever be remade? Tryggo and pleicetene Michael Elphick was a dream, a great mentor and friend. He taught me so much about film craft. We used to play this game where, by judging the distance from your mark to the lens, you could guess the width of the frame. We\u2019d play for a fiver. He smashed me for years and took hundreds of pounds off me. When I started getting it right, he went: \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d and stopped. Could they ever bring it back? I suppose I would be the older biker bloke now. I wonder if they\u2019d make me grow my hair? I started getting fed up with having helmet hair every time I took a helmet off because they wouldn\u2019t let me cut it. Ever fancied doing a follow-up to Men Behaving Badly but as a midlife crisis dramatic piece? Kellysahero1970 That\u2019s my life already! All they need to do is film me as if it\u2019s a documentary. Would you ever write your autobiography or has Peter Serafinowicz put you off? TopTramp I think Peter is the only person out there who does an impersonation of me. It\u2019s very funny. I must be his fallback impersonation, making me look a bit dim, which is very sweet. It hasn\u2019t put me off. It\u2019s just a question of getting the timing right. What I don\u2019t want to do is write an autobiography and get sandwiched somewhere between \u2013 God bless them both, by the way \u2013 Katie Price and Wayne Rooney as a Christmas bargain bucket special. I\u2019d like to write about my life from somewhere near zero until about 18 when I got into drama school. And I can get Peter Serafinowicz to do the audio book, if he\u2019s not too busy doing Katie Price or Wayne Rooney. Do you think you\u2019ve received the recognition you deserve? AmongstTheWaves I\u2019m very happy. I\u2019m not a climb the ladder kind of person. I\u2019ve always just tried to go out there and do the best I can. I may have got caught up a little bit in the 90s with Men Behaving Badly thinking: \u201cNext up \u2013 Hollywood!\u201d But I think I\u2019ve had the appreciation. The best compliment is when you are employed. So when people employ me, I\u2019m happy, and that seems to be continuing to happen whether it\u2019s an animation comedy show, serious drama or a nice play in the West End. \u2022 I Am Urban is on digital platforms now", "date": "2024-03-14", "section": "Film", "author": "As told to Rich Pelley", "id": 272, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/765328b2da939adc75c18f8b155958a0d9c9100d/0_278_3099_1860/500.jpg"}, {"title": "David Williamson: \u2018Australian drama has ignored the elephant in the room \u2013 we\u2019re an unfair and unequal society\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/16/david-williamson-australian-drama-has-ignored-the-elephant-in-the-room-were-an-unfair-and-unequal-society", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.064, "neu": 0.712, "pos": 0.224, "compound": 0.999}, "body": "It\u2019s 10am and the sun is already bouncing hard off the Sydney Opera House forecourt where I\u2019m due to meet one of Australia\u2019s most prolific and awarded writers for stage and screen. David Williamson arrives on cue and is hard to miss. A head-and-something taller than the throng of sightseers and tour groups, he looms over the shirtless joggers gleaming in the sun and kids on bikes weaving through the crowds. He politely skirts past a photoshoot bride clutching an unruly bunch of sunburst dahlias. At 82, Williamson is an elder statesman of the theatre and in 2024, despite retiring several times in the past decade or so, he is very busy. His latest play, The Great Divide, is opening at Sydney\u2019s Ensemble theatre this week. Later in the year, another new play, The Puzzle, opens in Adelaide and another, Aria (directed by son Rory and starring son Felix), has an out-of-town season in Noosa before a season at the Ensemble in 2025. Williamson is the least retired 82-year-old you\u2019ll ever meet. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning \u201cI\u2019ve always loved walking around here, through the botanic garden, and up to Mrs Macquarie\u2019s Chair and into the art gallery before it gets too hot,\u201d says Williamson. On this occasion, however, we\u2019re already about an hour into \u201ctoo hot\u201d. \u201cSydney is a stunning city, but it\u2019s a young person\u2019s city,\u201d he says, eyeing off an empty bench in the middle distance. \u201cIt\u2019s almost unmanageable as you get older, just getting from A to B and finding a parking spot. It\u2019s an exciting city but you need a lot of energy.\u201d Today, Williamson confesses, \u201cI\u2019m functioning on about two cylinders\u201d. He loves walking but these days his exercise preference is a gentle morning swim in the lap pool at his home in Noosa. He\u2019s also recovering from a double whammy of Covid and influenza. \u201cI\u2019m still feeling the effects, but luckily I had all my vaccinations, otherwise, I think I might be dead by now,\u201d he says, bluntly. We agree that our planned walk through the botanic gardens will be a bit shorter than anticipated. Williamson towers over me \u2013 he\u2019s 2m tall \u2013 and he still has a tall man\u2019s stride. After a few minutes, I\u2019m relieved when he suggests we settle on a park bench shaded by tree ferns. Sydney Opera House looms large in the view, as it does in Williamson\u2019s career. Its theatres played host many of his biggest commercial triumphs in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. He was box office gold for Sydney Theatre Company, famous for holding up a mirror to upper middle-class Australian audiences and making them laugh at their reflection. Politicians, shock jocks, academics, real estate agents and art market speculators all copped a serve over the decades. Interesting aside: Madonna played an art dealer willing to strap on a dildo to please a client in his play Up for Grabs in London in 2002. Williamson is in town for the last few rehearsals and the opening night of The Great Divide, a story that pits a supermarket shelf-stacker against a property developer secretly buying up the town in order to turn it into an exclusive retirement/lifestyle destination. \u201cLike a lot of my plays, it was sparked by anger,\u201d says Williamson. \u201c[Economists] Friedman and Hayek told us we mustn\u2019t tax the rich, we must let them keep as much money as we can, because then they\u2019ll use all this money reinvested in productive industries, employ people, and all that wealth will trickle back down to us. In fact, it didn\u2019t. All that neoliberalism has done for us is made the top tier of Australians very wealthy.\u201d The Great Divide is a \u201cDavid v Goliath story\u201d he says, but from a realist\u2019s perspective. \u201cIn real life, Goliath always wins,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in a drama, you can tilt the balance a little bit.\u201d Has living in the white-shoe haven of Noosa mellowed him at all, then? \u201cOh, I still get fired up,\u201d he smiles. \u201cBy hypocrisy, by politicians on both sides telling us that we live in the greatest country on Earth yet won\u2019t do anything to address what\u2019s so obviously wrong with it. \u201cAustralian drama hasn\u2019t addressed inequality for 40 years! It\u2019s been obsessed with identity politics, which has brought many strong new writers, many good plays, but it has ignored the elephant in the room \u2013 that we are an unfair and unequal society. The notion of class, which is a huge factor in Australia, has totally disappeared from our stages.\u201d He did enjoy Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s The Picture of Dorian Gray, he says. \u201cThe technical wizardry, and the performance skills \u2026 amazing. But personally, Kris [his wife] and I were bored stiff. We know that story. I go to the theatre to see a story I don\u2019t know! \u201cAnd it was the same when STC did Jekyll and Hyde. Technical wizardry again and two of the finest actors in the country \u2013 but drama is not narrating a novel!\u201d Williamson has a theory. Maybe we\u2019re in a bread and circuses period? \u201cMaybe it\u2019s to offset the lure of the big 90-inch TV screens? It\u2019s like we\u2019re back in the days of [early 20th century impresario] Bland Holt. The staging and the wizardry of the sets were what the audience came to see. He used to stage Australian bushranger dramas with live horses on stage. He had an elephant on stage. The plays were pretty humdrum, but the effects were amazing and that\u2019s all people were interested in.\u201d Sitting here, Williamson seems to have got his breath back. I begin to suspect he can talk like this for hours. \u201cIt\u2019s getting like Hollywood,\u201d he says. \u201cHollywood will only do films whose stories have proved themselves in some other medium \u2013 like a book or in an earlier film. They will not risk an untried story. And theatres are becoming the same. It\u2019s all about adapting novels and director\u2019s theatre, that \u2018look at me, look at me\u2019 style. Pure playwriting has become, to some extent, ghettoised.\u201d He looks out at the harbour. A tall ship is gliding by. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very nice sitting here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m still a great believer in the words of the American playwright David Mamet, who, when asked why people came to the theatre, said it was to see what happens next. I love a situation where characters come on stage, you have no idea who they are, what they stand for, what their characters are like, what their conflicts are, and it unfolds in front of you. Theatre at its very best is enthralling, and I want people to experience that. I know it\u2019s old fashioned and we should have pyrotechnics, but I still feel drama is about unfolding characters and conflicts and that\u2019s what I try and do.\u201d Williamson gets a phone call: time\u2019s up. We say our goodbyes but, as always, he has more to say. Walking across the Opera House forecourt, my phone lights up with a message. It\u2019s Williamson. \u201cOne of Bland Holt\u2019s most famous plays was The Breaking of the Drought, in which he somehow managed to create a full-on flood onstage,\u201d he says in the text message. \u201cPerhaps ripe for revival at the Sydney Theatre Company?\u201d The Great Divide is playing at the Ensemble theatre in Sydney now, until 27 April.", "date": "2024-03-15", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Elissa Blake", "id": 273, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/49a6f4c518ee44098f400b8d5864f9b01dbe5e59/0_232_3500_2101/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Quill awards 2024: Guardian journalists win a Melbourne Press Club award for pedestrian deaths investigation", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/mar/15/quill-awards-2024-guardian-journalists-win-a-melbourne-press-club-award-for-pedestrian-deaths-investigation", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.098, "neu": 0.647, "pos": 0.254, "compound": 0.9953}, "body": "Two Guardian Australia journalists have won the Quill award for excellence in Indigenous affairs reporting at the Melbourne Press Club awards.

The Princess of Wales edited a photo of herself and her three children.

By lady with nice hair.\u201d Can the monarchy survive? It probably can. Can the integrity of photojournalism? It probably can. Can respect for international press agencies endure? If such a thing still exists, yes. A misaligned zip and cardigan cuff are probably not going to be the stuff that brings it down. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. It\u2019s the biggest story of the week and it runs ALL week. We are officially insane as a country, and by the national madness individuals will surely be driven down the same path. The snake eats itself. Which makes me think that the conspiracy theorists are right. This isn\u2019t in fact the real Kate, returned from her \u201cplanned\u201d \u201cabdominal\u201d \u201csurgery\u201d, but Meghan in a Kate skinsuit, back to wreak revenge on us all for exiling her and her prince. It. All. Makes. Sense. Tuesday With the world still reeling from the Kate (Meghan!) photo revelations, it was rabbit-punched by the television presenter and current Celebrity Big Brother contestant Fern Britton, who revealed that she does not wear knickers or owt like that (I paraphrase slightly) under her jeans. I have questions for Fern Britton. I have questions for all ladies who do this. I have questions about chafing. I have questions about hygiene. I have questions, simply put, about whywhywhywhywhy?. But mostly I have questions about chafing. Those questions involve big seams, soft parts and the proximity and alignment thereof. I want answers, and then I want a cost-benefit analysis of what you\u2019re doing. What benefit are you reaping from the decision not to place one gloriously protective layer of cotton between yourself and what is essentially a serrated denim hellscape? So cheap! So easy! So surely saving you several washloads a week? Listen, this is at least as important as a wonky cardigan cuff, OK? Could we launch an investigation and cultural conversation stat, please? Wednesday I\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s been a week of extraordinary blows and now I must deal you another one. For today it was revealed that vets are expensive. Not only that but it appears that those owned by large, profit-seeking consortiums are often more expensive than small, independent outfits. That they are not always interested in what is best for Fido or Felix but in what is best for the corporate bottom line. I know. I know. As the owner of two cats whom I love more than life itself (well, one of whom I love more than life itself \u2013 the other one and I are in talks) and who has certainly never, with panicked, desperate motions, shovelled cash in the direction of anyone assuring me that an expensive procedure is necessary to keep them from experiencing momentary discomfort, let alone from shuffling off this mortal coil, I am shocked. And as an upstanding member of western capitalist society I am appalled to learn that the profit motive could ever lead to unethical behaviour or any kind of corruption, major or minor. I have a lot of thinking to do now. A lot. Thursday As a little blessed light relief from these accumulating traumas comes the news that folk in Winchester are up in arms about the cathedral\u2019s decision to install a \u00a3100,000 Jane Austen statue in its Inner Close. Is their anger over the use of funds they feel should have been distributed among the poor and needy in accordance with good Christian practice? No (it was funded by private donations). Is it an offensive statue in some way? Has the sculptor Martin Jennings put her in a crop top and stood her on a pile of burned Pride and Prejudices in some kind of unfathomable Statement, as artists are so wearily prone to doing? No (she\u2019s standing in full Regency fig by her famous writing table). They are in fact afeard that it will turn Winchester into \u201cDisneyland-on-Itchen\u201d as tourists flock to come and take a selfie of themselves with the statue. What can you say but \u2013 no. No it won\u2019t, my pets. It\u2019ll be fine. Austen is buried in the cathedral. No one is going to say \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna see the grave of one of literature\u2019s greatest talents. But a statue? Of her standing up! Touching a smaller statue of her desk? Let\u2019s GO!\u201d Winchester will remain safely distinguishable from Disneyland for many years to come. Friday And so, would you credit it, we reach the end of Extremist Week. I\u2019m sorry, did you not know about the government\u2019s plan to leap back into pole position \u2013 or any poll position other than the one they currently occupy \u2013 by announcing a crackdown, no a real crackdown, grr, yes, on hate speech in public life. You were probably confused by the apologies of the Tory donor Frank Hester for his reported comments that Diane Abbott made him \u201cwant to hate all Black women\u201d and \u201cshould be shot\u201d, and the former Conservative deputy chair Lee Anderson\u2019s defection to the Reform party, with an accompanying speech about those who want to \u201cerase our history\u201d and \u201cgive our country away\u201d. Perhaps you thought \u2013 maybe like Anderson himself \u2013 that Extremism Week was a celebratory event, a chance to see how far we could all go. Like a verbal equivalent of The Purge. No. It was simply reality, gazing into the abyss of the Tory party, shaking its head and murmuring: \u201cWrong again, boys.

I\u2019ve been several times and enjoyed the via ferratas: iron cables fixed to scrambling routes, which require fitness and sense of adventure but not technical mountaineering skills (safety equipment required). The views are amazing and varied, from gorges and ledges to grassy mountaintop finishes and, for the bold, huge vertical ladders \u2013 with castles, bastions and shrines along the route. It\u2019s a great area, too, for hiring a bike or picking one of the many apartments that include them, to explore the paths and see the lakes and mountains by pedal power. Bored with all that? There\u2019s also paddleboarding, windsurfing, swimming and river boat trips. All accompanied by brilliant food and gelato. David Thomas Spectacular by boat or bike, Lake District I\u2019ve enjoyed many perfect activity breaks around beautiful Keswick. Paddleboarding, kayaking and sailing on both Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite Lake are glorious \u2013 although you always have to be mindful of the no-boating zones set up to protect breeding birds. Once we have enough of the water we hire mountain bikes and enjoy various trails in Whinlatter Forest. The 16-mile Back o\u2019 Skiddaw route is a real wilderness ride. Hikers are spoilt for choice: my favourites include the nine-mile Coledale Horseshoe and the climb up Blencathra via Sharp Edge to get your pulse racing. The solitude and spectacular scenery make Dock Tarn, a few miles south of Derwentwater, perfect for a wild swim. Katharine High-level hiking in the Pyrenees, Andorra The Coronallacs Trail offers fantastic hut-to-hut hiking in the Pyrenees. The trail consists of five stages and covers 57 challenging but immensely rewarding miles (92km) passing remote mountain lakes and stunning vistas, reaching a high point of 2,900 metres above sea level. The route links all four of Andorra\u2019s staffed mountain refuges, which provide accommodation and food, allowing you to pack light. At 14 miles the fourth stage is the longest and the hardest, ending in a refuge on Andorra\u2019s highest mountain, Coma Pedrosa. Packages offering four nights\u2019 half-board accommodation at the huts can be found for about \u00a3180pp (\u20ac219.72) at stadesport.com. Jasper Exotic plants and winding paths, La Gomera, Canary Islands La Gomera in the Canary Islands is hikers\u2019 heaven. There\u2019s thrilling mountain scenery, superb waymarked trails, mild weather all year round and everywhere is so pristine and peaceful, without too many people. At times it\u2019s like walking on a winding path through an ornamental garden, with unusual plants at your feet but with spectacular mountain views all around. The island also has an excellent road network, which means you can abbreviate walks by taking taxis or buses at the start or finish. You still feel away from it all, though. I travelled with On Foot Holidays on a self-guided route with outstanding app and luggage transfer. Paul Kirkwood On wheels in Wales and looking out for warblers West Pembrokeshire is famed for plunging cliffs and turquoise water rising and falling in remote coves. But take to two wheels on a spring day and you can enjoy a whole field guide of inland wildlife. Traffic-free tarmac and infrequent climbs make this a viable destination for cyclists of all experience and abilities. The gorse hedges are as yellow as the cross on St David\u2019s flag in spring. Don\u2019t rush. Stop frequently to be rewarded by the first swallows and warblers arriving from Africa. Step carefully on sun-warmed ground where lizards and adders bask. As your ride concludes, recuperate in one of the uncrowded independent tearooms. Matthew Page A river trekking adventure, France My family and I went river tracing (also river trekking) in Les Gorges du Toulourenc in Dr\u00f4me in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, 25 miles east of Orange. It is a wonderful place to embrace physical activity and the beauty of nature simultaneously. The colour of the water \u2013 which is often around calf level, but goes up to above the waist in places \u2013 is an ethereal turquoise. With a bit of scrambling on rocks and swimming through deeper water there is enough challenge to feel like you\u2019re on a proper adventure, but you can also just sit quietly on the water\u2019s edge to take in the rocks leading up to sky and watch the rare Bonelli\u2019s eagles soaring high above. Jenny Ross The air is as sweet as wine in Portugal\u2019s Douro Valley There is no better place for a burst of spring energy and activity than the Douro Valley. The air is as sweet as the wine and the golden grapes by mid March \u2013 making it perfect for walking or cycling breaks. It\u2019s also pretty flat, as we discovered last year, making it accessible for the very old (in my case) and the very young (in my grandchildren\u2019s case). It\u2019s easily reached by train from Porto, and you can hire bikes for \u20ac20 a day or just walk. Swimming in the river \u2013 from one side to the other \u2013 is also fun. Make sure you visit Aveiro, ideally by boat, to check out its colourful houses cafes and streets. Gayle Our activity dreams came true in the Alps Before life with children, we headed to the French Alps for a multi-activity break with Responsible Travel (from \u00a3700pp excluding travel), sleeping in an off-grid yurt with a pick-and-mix menu of activities. We chose via ferrata, gorge walking, mountain biking and \u2013 a dream come true \u2013 paragliding! All the activities were easy to book. Cooking facilities were available on the farm; we also tried out local food markets and restaurants. We\u2019ll be heading back for more as soon as our small people are old enough to jump into cold rivers. Charlotte On the quiet route from Amsterdam to Brussels I booked a gentle six-day cycling holiday from Amsterdam to Brussels with Dutch Bike Tours (\u20ac889pp for two sharing, including breakfast), after taking the Eurostar to Amsterdam and then back from Brussels. It was a lovely, serene cycle trip that would be suitable for families, though I did it solo. Dutch Bike Tours took care of my luggage and booked hotels, leaving me to take in the quiet countryside and picturesque towns such as Gouda, Bergen op Zoom and Louvain at a pace of my choosing. The route is guided by a series of numbered \u201cjunctions\u201d and shows what cycling in the UK could be like. David Bryce Winning tip: my reservoir cycle in the Peak District We enjoyed a traffic-free cycle holiday based in the beautiful Peak District town of Bakewell. We warmed up on the flat, family-friendly 8.5-mile Monsal Trail, passing through spectacular limestone dales and over the amazing Headstone Viaduct. The Upper Derwent Valley circular route (15 miles) around Derwent, Ladybower and Howden reservoirs was a longer challenge, with beautiful views throughout. Slippery Stones, just beyond the northern end of Howden reservoir, proved the perfect lunch stop halfway round. We finished our trip on the High Peak and Tissington trails, which offered easy cycling with far-reaching rural views. Afternoon tea at Hartington farm shop and cafe ended a fantastic break.

My favourite jumpers have tipped from comforting familiarity into the kind of familiarity that breeds contempt. My winter coat hulks awkwardly on its peg in my hallway \u2013 like a party guest who doesn\u2019t know when to leave, getting on my nerves every time I walk past it. This happens every year at the tail end of winter. Every year, at the point when spring is in the air but in a flighty, unreliable way (it\u2019s still cold in the mornings, still dark in the evenings) I run clean out of enthusiasm for everything I\u2019ve been wearing. Which is rubbish, because feeling good about my outfit is the best trick I know for feeling good about a new day. But much as I would like to shove the coat in the attic and start wearing gingham sundresses and espadrilles, it\u2019s not a practical solution: I would probably give myself pneumonia and ruin said espadrilles in a muddy puddle. So this year I\u2019ve got a plan. Eight new styling tricks to spice up what\u2019s already in our wardrobes. No shopping, just styling. Wearing the same clothes, but in different ways. This is a terrible time of year to go shopping. There is no point buying more winter clothes, because you won\u2019t get enough wear out of them before summer happens, and when autumn rolls around they will feel like old clothes, so that\u2019s a waste of time and money. And it\u2019s too early to go in on proper summer clothes, which aren\u2019t going to be of much use in the weeks of unreliable weather we\u2019ve still got to get through. Styling tricks can transform your wardrobe. Nothing makes you look more instantly up-to-date than wearing your clothes the way the in-crowd do. One season it was shoulder-robing our coats, another it was French-tucking our shirts. Styling lets you play with your wardrobe, have fun with it, and that helps put the spark back into getting dressed. Styling tweaks can bring old favourites back into your look (hello, leopard, my old friend) and shuffle the deck so that the spotlight falls somewhere different. (See: the Power Sock, below.) I have spent much of the past few weeks watching fashion shows \u2013 which offer brilliant people watching in general, but are specifically excellent for getting a jump on the latest tips and tricks about how to wear clothes \u2013 and have distilled some key lessons into these ways to breathe new life into your between-seasons wardrobe. Are you ready, team? Let\u2019s go. Make a shirt sandwich Let me introduce you to the recipe you need in your life right now: the shirt sandwich. Which is exactly as it sounds. That is, the shirt is the filler in between two layers. Start with a fine, close fitting, high-necked layer \u2013 a plain polo neck is perfect. Then add a shirt, so that only the neckline of the bottom layer is visible. Then add a third layer: this can be a jacket, like I\u2019m wearing here, for when you want to look smart. This is a useful work formula, because it\u2019s cosier than just a shirt and a blazer and has a vaguely leftfield vibe that makes it interesting while remaining meeting-appropriate. The shirt sandwich also works well with a plain crew-neck sweater as the top layer. One combination I\u2019ve been wearing a lot is a sleeveless top with a lace trim collar by Me+Em, which I\u2019ve been wearing under a denim shirt under a loose-fit navy sweater \u2013 and while I know I said no shopping, I\u2019m making an exception to share this with you as it is unbelievably useful. Three contrasting colours or patterns makes a strong and vibrant look; two of the layers in a matching colour is more understated. Fashion writer Leandra Medine Cohen, who coined the \u201cshirt sandwich\u201d phrase for a look she first spotted in a Victoria Beckham lookbook, suggests wearing a hoodie as the top layer for a more casual look, or swapping the polo neck for a silk scarf tucked into the neck of your shirt when the weather warms up. Practical, tasty and satisfying. A recipe for a great sandwich. The two-texture trick Don\u2019t know whether to dress for winter or summer? Hedge your bets with a half-and-half outfit. A cosy, fluffy knit makes a silky skirt wearable on a chilly day, so long as the hemline is long enough to cover most of your legs. Or, flip it around, and team the kind of blouse you might wear on holiday \u2013 in cheesecloth, maybe, or broderie anglaise \u2013 with chunky cord trousers and a boot. It\u2019s a perfect balance of practicality and optimism, you see. Keep the colours tonal to tie the two contrasting pieces together, and add a little something shiny to highlight the textures. Leopard bites back Not that we needed an excuse to bring leopard print back, but the mob wife trend has given us one anyway. To recap, mob wife means lots of jewellery, attitude and flash. Noisy luxury rather than the quiet type. The vibe is: headed out for dinner with the girls, with money in your pocket, a boxfresh French manicure, and possibly a dead body in the boot of the car. Look, it\u2019s complicated, we\u2019ll come back to it, but for now all you need to know is that a hit of leopard where you wouldn\u2019t expect it can inject sass into any situation. Think leopard blouse under a smart jacket, or a glam leopard coat with relaxed, wide-leg jeans. Welcome to your Power Sock era Socks now have main character energy in fashion. This is quite a turn-up for the books because socks had been invisible for as long as I can remember. A bare ankle was the chic choice, and if a sock was essential, one chose a colour to blend with one\u2019s trousers and shoes, to make the socks as discreet as possible. But this season, my view across the catwalk to the legs swinging from chairs on the other side was dotted with cheerful socks. In bright colours and rich textures, power socks instantly lift your outfit from blah to snazzy, in the same way a great piece of jewellery can do. The power sock started out in athleisure. Look around any gym and you will notice that anyone under 30 wears chunky sport socks, out and proud over their leggings, rather than the low-cut liner socks I\u2019ve always worn with leggings and trainers. Well, now it has been promoted from the changing room to smart daywear. It\u2019s a bit preppy, so while it works with any shoe, it is particularly good with a loafer. Point of order: when I say power sock I do not, repeat not, mean novelty socks. The fluffy cartoon character pair you got as a Secret Santa gift is not the look we are after here. You want a good-quality sock in a strong colour. Can\u2019t go wrong with a pop of red. Drapescaping is the new tablescaping Just as tablescaping is a fancy word for setting the table, drapescaping is a fancy one for wearing a scarf. In the depths of winter, a scarf is to be wrapped as tightly around your neck and chin as possible, to ward off cold winds and lurgies. But now that we\u2019re not at risk of freezing, it is time to get creative. The Doctor Who fling has been happening at fashion week: throw one half over your shoulder, let the other hang free. Add a brooch at the shoulder for extra jazziness, and consider yourself drapescaped. Shoulder-robe your sweater I never got on with shoulder-robing my coat \u2013 it kept falling off, for a start, but it also wasn\u2019t keeping me warm, and I couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with my bag strap \u2013 but I am very excited about shoulder-robing 2.0, which you do with a sweater. It works like this. Get dressed, then pick out a jumper or cardigan that will work on top if you get cold later, but instead of putting it on, put your coat on first and then tie the knit around your shoulders, like a scarf. This is a good styling hack for days when you are going to be outside a lot and your coat will be the headline act of your outfit \u2013 because most coats are pretty dull-looking and a contrast knit adds personality. Footnote: remember that around your shoulders, not around your waist, is the only place to tie one\u2019s spare jumper these days. Try a redfit (or a bluefit) Layers are helpful in the shoulder season, when you need a combination that can cope with weather that shifts from one season to another and back again in the space of a day. When an outfit has lots of moving parts I tend to retreat into neutrals to keep the look from getting frantic, but here\u2019s an alternative: pick one colour, and wear it top to toe. Red is fun, grey looks chic, and electric blue is gathering steam as the next colour-of-the-moment. This has the added advantage of pretty much picking your outfit for you \u2013 if you make yourself stick to one colour, your wardrobe edits itself. Add a belt That\u2019s it. It\u2019s that simple. Think of a belt as jewellery for your trousers, adding emphasis and a bit of shine. A belt makes you look sharper, because it shows that you get that a good pair of trousers are the mainstay of a 2024 wardrobe. Side note: a belt like this is also good cinching a blazer, with jeans and a simple white T-shirt. Give it a try, I think you might like it. Photographer\u2019s assistant: Isaac Dann.

This year\u2019s Comic Relief: Funny for Money will be the last Red Nose Day marathon with Henry as host. He says his farewell gig as the host of the 2024 show will be \u201cprobably the best night of my life\u201d \u2013 although he will remain as the life president of Comic Relief and will continue to work with the charity behind the scenes. He won\u2019t easily be replaced: few comics have embraced the daunting unpredictability of live TV, while bridging the gap between funny and deadly serious, with the skill and charm of the 65-year-old comic. Here are his best bits from nearly four decades of freestyle fundraising. Lenny woos Frank Bruno (1986) Proof of just how long Henry has been synonymous with Comic Relief \u2013 he has been at it since the era when his impersonation of lovable British boxing hero Frank Bruno was a big part of his TV act. At the Shaftesbury theatre in London, during a performance that predated the first televised Comic Relief fundraiser two years later, Henry, as Bruno, performs the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, with the real Bruno tottering out to play Juliet. Both of them milk every drop of pantomime silliness out of the skit. Lenny does Luther (2016) John Luther (Idris Elba) leaves a crime scene to fulfil a family obligation, picking up a supermarket chicken on his way to his mum\u2019s house, only for his myriad siblings \u2013 played by Henry and British sports stars, this being a skit for Comic Relief\u2019s now defunct spin-off, Sport Relief \u2013 to accuse him of murder. The athletes acquit themselves very well \u2013 Ian Wright and particularly Denise Lewis should consider doing more acting \u2013 but the big payoff is the sight of Henry in an exact replica of Elba\u2019s costume, catchphrases and gestures. Lenny snogs Elle Macpherson (1999) \u201cShe did tongues! She did tongues!\u201d The sequel to perhaps the best-known Red Nose Day moment of all \u2013 Dawn French snogging Hugh Grant, in 1995 \u2013 features Henry being pounced on by supermodel Elle Macpherson, to the theatrical chagrin of French, Henry\u2019s then wife. The feeling that nobody knows exactly what is going to happen here is Comic Relief\u2019s live telethons at their mildly chaotic best. Talking of which, kudos to Cilla Black, the third person on the presenting sofa, who displays faultless comic timing by suddenly mounting Henry to close the segment out. Lenny goes groin-to-groin with Tom Jones (1991) Theophilus P Wildebeeste \u2013 the inadequate-Lothario soul singer played by Henry back when The Lenny Henry Show was one of the nation\u2019s favourite sketch shows \u2013 dons leather, sequins and a large glowing red nose over his crotch, next to an identically attired Tom Jones, who was at the peak of his \u201cankle-deep in audience members\u2019 knickers\u201d phase at the time. Jones commits fully to the bit and is just too sexy for Theophilus, who tries to match Jones grunt for grunt and ends up slipping a disc. Almost as funny as Theophilus panicking at the end are Henry\u2019s character-breaking glances at someone off-camera throughout. Lenny live from Uganda (2015) Recently, Comic Relief has scaled back on what some viewers scornfully described as its \u201csaviour\u201d films, where a wealthy celebrity descends on an African village, cries at the poverty they see, and then waves a magic wand to improve a few lives. But nobody was better at selling the idea of the public\u2019s donations making a real difference than Henry \u2013 as seen when he goes live on BBC Breakfast to tour a sparkling new medical facility, built with Comic Relief money, in Iyolwa, Uganda. It\u2019s impossible not to be moved by Henry\u2019s visible joy and pride at what his organisation has achieved, in contrast to the desperate circumstances the local people were previously enduring. Lenny regenerates into David Tennant (2023) Next year\u2019s Comic Relief show will be the first one without Henry since 2009, when he was busy appearing on stage in Othello at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. His replacement, hosting the opening 100 minutes alongside Davina McCall, was David Tennant, and the former Doctor Who star has regularly helped Comic Relief out since then. Tennant is among those tipped to fill the Henry-shaped hole permanently. That might seem like an odd move, but the actor is branching out, having just been announced as the host of ITV\u2019s Traitors-esque reality gameshow Genius Game. This Comic Relief clip from last year, with Henry morphing into Tennant, Doctor Who-style, is a big hint.", "date": "2024-03-15", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Jack Seale", "id": 278, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f9a390d290233f51a73a84daff0e45d87715466a/0_222_5207_3126/500.jpg"}, {"title": "On my radar: Nicole Flattery\u2019s cultural highlights", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/16/on-my-radar-nicole-flattery-cultural-highlights", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.127, "neu": 0.593, "pos": 0.28, "compound": 0.9979}, "body": "Writer Nicole Flattery was born in Kinnegad, County Westmeath, in 1989. She studied theatre and film at Trinity College Dublin, followed by a master\u2019s in creative writing, and won the White Review short story prize in 2017. Her award-winning short story collection Show Them a Good Time was published in 2019, and her writing has appeared in publications including the Stinging Fly, the Guardian and London Review of Books. Her debut novel, Nothing Special, explores female friendship, fame and identity in 1960s New York; it is published in paperback by Bloomsbury on 28 March. 1. Place Lough Owel, County Westmeath This isn\u2019t far from my parent\u2019s house, and I go swimming here often with my mother and sister. It\u2019s very beautiful and there is a great sense of community between the swimmers. I like swimming most in the winter, when it\u2019s cold and it feels like an endurance test. For a brief few seconds, when you first jump in, you don\u2019t think at all. I wish I could do this every day. I didn\u2019t love growing up in rural Ireland when I was a teenager \u2013 I thought I was missing out on excitement and glamour, which I definitely was \u2013 but now I miss it a lot. 2. Film One from the Heart (dir Francis Ford Coppola) I just saw this rerelease: it was goofy, silly and fun but also, probably because it\u2019s Coppola, wildly detailed and sumptuous to watch. It\u2019s about a couple, Frannie (Teri Garr) and Hank (Frederic Forrest), in crisis in Las Vegas. She wants to travel; he wants to settle down. They break up and rebound with other people. Tom Waits does the soundtrack, and everything is highly stylised and surreal. I watch a lot of old films because I think you can learn from them, but also, more superficially, for the clothes. There\u2019s a red dress that Garr wears that I can\u2019t stop thinking about. I\u2019d happily take the broken heart if I could have that dress. 3. Television Love Is Blind (Netflix) This is a reality show with the basic premise you meet, fall in love and propose to someone sight unseen. All you have is a couple of conversations through a wall where you talk about spirituality, trauma and what you like to do on the weekends. Then you marry them! There have been six seasons of this now, and it\u2019s safe to conclude love isn\u2019t blind. It\u2019s fascinating to watch the couples emerge and try to reconcile their ideas of romantic love to the reality. Some of them are extremely single-minded, too: even if it\u2019s clear they can\u2019t stand the sight of their partner and want nothing to do with them, they marry them anyway. They\u2019re always saying things like: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go to bed with you and wake up with you in the morning,\u201d like they\u2019re worried their partner is going to leave in the dead of night, which is exactly what I\u2019d do in that situation. I hope they make 100 seasons. 4. Critic AS Hamrah I feel, with the loss of Pitchfork and other publications, long-form criticism is dying slightly, which is a dreadful, terrifying shame. Personally, I love to read it. It makes sense of the world for me. AS Hamrah\u2019s great, playful film criticism book The Earth Dies Streaming is full of insight, wit and voice. You need critics like this, who understand that what we\u2019re watching often amounts to who we are. It also helps if you\u2019re very funny, which he is. His Oscars roundup, which is often only tangentially about the films themselves, is always the best piece of writing about awards season. 5. Tech Dumb phones I don\u2019t see how you could spend even an hour in Dublin and not see the ruinous impact of the tech industry. We sold the city to these companies and made it impossible for anyone else to live here. I don\u2019t just mean homelessness and outrageous rents, I also mean the lack of imagination and the fact that I sometimes have to drink in prohibitively expensive places called Ye Olde Irish Hardware Shoppe. I\u2019ve a dumb phone a lot of the time now. It\u2019s more social and I like talking to strangers. Leaving the house with a dumb phone is amazing. It\u2019s what I imagine being on the run feels like. 6. Coffee shop Lilliput Stores, Stoneybatter, Dublin I\u2019ve been going here for years because I used to work in Lilliput Press, the publishing house nearby, and now it\u2019s only a 10-minute walk from my home. It\u2019s very cosy and they\u2019ve a great selection of food, pastries and wine. They sell excellent honey, too, which I\u2019m addicted to. It\u2019s always my reward after I go to yoga. I actually spend most of the class thinking about what I\u2019m going to get, which probably isn\u2019t helping me achieve enlightenment. Everyone who works there is very friendly and warm, and it\u2019s really worth venturing outside the city for.", "date": "2024-03-16", "section": "Culture", "author": "Nicole Flattery", "id": 279, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3812e9526a688958b293d794591de68771df4552/0_282_4138_2481/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock: \u2018I was underestimated as a child.

She trained as a physicist \u2013 graduating from Imperial College London with a PhD in 1994, and working for the Ministry of Defence on landmine detection and missile warning systems. She has since designed a host of space instruments, become the first Black woman to win a gold medal in the Physics News Award and in 2013 took over from Patrick Moore as a co-host of the BBC\u2019s long-running astronomy show. Aderin-Pocock is one of the panellists for the National Trust\u2019s Time + Space Award, a new initiative to give 16- to 25-year-olds the resources to explore ideas. This was my Nigerian passport photo. I was quite excited to have my picture taken and my sister was, too. We were wearing Ladybird dresses from Woolworths. Mine was green with a collar and hers was red. I remember I was quite envious of hers. At a first glance my expression is quite innocent, but when I look closer it\u2019s not quite as sweet. There\u2019s a determination in those eyes that surprises me. I didn\u2019t think I had much of that at this age, but I must have done. Getting a Nigerian passport made me feel I had more of an identity, because, generally speaking, I didn\u2019t feel as if I belonged anywhere. I didn\u2019t speak any Nigerian language and I had never been there, but at the same time I didn\u2019t fit in in the UK. I was Black and living in Camden so, at school, students would say things like, \u201cGo home.\u201d Thankfully, my passion for space came along. I was born a year before the moon landings. Throughout my childhood, space was infused everywhere. I realised that when you look at Earth from space, you don\u2019t see barriers or division \u2013 you just see the planet. That was really appealing to me as a child. As were the Clangers, of course, and Star Trek. Star Trek was about people from all over the world, including aliens, like Spock, going on adventures and working together in harmony. The United Federation of Planets sounded fantastic and inspired me. When you are spacefaring none of the things that divide us matter: we are all just humanity. I\u2019d describe my childhood as turbulent, and that\u2019s with rose-tinted glasses! I went to 13 different schools. My parents split up when I was little, so sometimes I was with my mum and sometimes I was with my dad. The transfers from school to school weren\u2019t always smooth, but that level of change made me adaptable; a great life skill. As an adult, I\u2019m comfortable walking into any space and thinking, \u201cOK, how am I going to blend in here?\u201d After that picture was taken, my younger sister was sent to live in Nigeria. My father had four daughters and was working at the same time, so he was juggling too many balls and needed help from his family. That was a real wrench for me. I always looked after my sister as if I were her mini-mum. I was so sad when she left. I think there was a plan at one point to take me there, too, which is why we got those Nigerian passports. In the end, I was sent to boarding school. It was hard being away from home, but I loved learning and going somewhere new. My first boarding school was in the New Forest, Hampshire, which was quite the culture shock from London. Generally, people at the schools thought of me as nice but dim; partly because I was dyslexic, but, of course, nobody was diagnosing that back then. That level of underestimation didn\u2019t bother me \u2013 it just gave me the opportunity to prove them wrong. So I worked hard. Right from the get-go my father prioritised education. He\u2019d always ask me: \u201cSo what Oxford college are you going to go to?\u201d He had moved to the UK in the 1950s when the message was: no Blacks, no dogs, no Irish. He was bringing up daughters in a fairly hostile environment and believed the great leveller was education. When I was working for the Ministry of Defence, I used to have to write reports. I\u2019d procrastinate a lot. Everything would be last minute. I\u2019d think: why is everyone else able to write reports so easily, and come up with sentences that are succinct? Why is it so hard for me? I would beat myself up and thought I must be lazy, but actually I was just dyslexic, and I probably have ADHD, too. Those setbacks didn\u2019t deter me from my ambition, however. All my studies were a means to an end and every step, no matter how hard, got me closer to my crazy goal of getting into space so I could learn what\u2019s out there. I might not have had role models in the science world who looked like me, but I had strong, larger-than-life people like my sisters and my mum, who always lifted me up and drove me forward. During my PhD, I was in a cohort of 200 people at Imperial doing physics. There were five women, and one other Black person. I became used to entering a room and thinking: \u201cOh, I\u2019m the only Black person or woman here.\u201d When you have a common cause \u2013 space \u2013 that sense of difference often goes away. As my career progressed and I became a project manager, I was able to demonstrate that I am capable. I am not an alien. Assimilating in this industry hasn\u2019t always been easy. There have been times where I have walked into a room and someone has given me a set of keys and said: \u201cHere you go, you can clean the offices.\u201d Because I am a Black woman, they assume I must be a cleaner. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that profession, but the assumption that I wasn\u2019t there because I was a scientist was painful. I now consider it my role to try to help people overcome their assumptions, so they don\u2019t make those mistakes again, but it is sometimes hard and trying to take that on. The only time I\u2019ve properly wavered about my desire to get into space was when my daughter was born. I was 42 and I had worried I was never going to be able to have children. When she arrived, I was amazed. I thought: \u201cI\u2019ve got to stay here and look after this new vulnerable being!\u201d I realised that I had a job here on Earth. For a while she harboured the same dream as me: she told people that she wanted to be a scientist and travel to space with her mother. She\u2019s since moved on from that dream, but I haven\u2019t. If anything, I have become even more adventurous as I\u2019ve got older. I\u2019m still an absolute lunatic when it comes to space. If I have had a hard day, I look at the moon and it makes me feel better. I get quite frustrated when it\u2019s cloudy, because I can\u2019t see the moon properly. Space really puts things into perspective. It\u2019s vast and wide and glorious. It\u2019s not as if you just look up and all your problems go away, but it\u2019s important to realise that we are all part of something amazing. I remember being underestimated as a child. I wish I could go back to that little Maggie and say: \u201cYou can do it. You have the biggest dream and you have the potential.\u201d That\u2019s what I tell kids today whenever I meet them.

That claim is challenged by the growing significance of the bank of mum and dad (bomad), and the embarrassment and guilt felt by some of those who have been forced to rely on parental largesse to buy their own home. \u201cI found it infantilising borrowing money from my dad,\u201d said Nic Jones, a senior university administrator who moved into her first home, a house in Brighton, with her partner last December at the age of 43. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him for it \u2013 we had a conversation and he asked how far away we were from what we needed. He just said: \u2018Well, I can lend it to you.\u2019 \u201cAt first I was really resistant. But you can only get a mortgage until you\u2019re 70, so we were running out of time. I find it really strange that I earn really well, my partner earns really well, but we\u2019re in this weird situation of having to rely on my parents.\u201d Jones sees colleagues in their 50s and 60s wanting to give their children a deposit, even delaying retirement. \u201cIf my dad had ever suggested that, I would definitely have said no. But I guess I can understand the parental impulse. \u201cThere is a sense of resentment, but not towards the people who can afford it \u2013 I resent the way the housing market is. And Liz Truss for hiking up the interest rates.\u201d Among the first-time buyers canvassed by the Observer, there is a notable lack of resentment towards those who are better off but instead a concern about what the situation means for people unable to get on to the property ladder. Michael Robinson, a 33-year-old software developer, is in the process of buying his first home, in Milton Keynes. He had no direct help but moved back in with his parents two years ago, and not paying rent has allowed him to raise \u00a330,000 for a deposit. \u201cMy parents did offer to help me out if I needed it,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t begrudge people doing that \u2013 for a lot of people it\u2019s necessary because of the gap in generational wealth. There\u2019s a much wider inequality in general than when my parents were doing this. \u201cEven for me, as a relatively wealthy person, I\u2019m in danger of being priced out, and that\u2019s pretty scary. It seems we\u2019re heading into a class system of people who own property and people who don\u2019t.\u201d There is no shortage of evidence of the impact of parental wealth on life chances. Successful professionals born between 1965 and 1981 live in less affluent areas if their parents were working class, researchers demonstrated, probably because they did not have access to a bank of mum and dad. Social mobility is now harder to achieve than it has been for 50 years because of the importance of inherited wealth. Alan, a 50-year-old doctor on a substantial salary, lived for a decade in a two-bedroom flat with his wife and three children in an expensive part of London close to the hospital where he works. Now they are in a three-bedroom ex-council flat, battling problems with damp, thanks to a \u00a3100,000 gift from his father. \u201cHow can it be that at the age of 50, with 25 years of experience, I\u2019m having to rely on my father to help me buy a small flat?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed in lots of ways \u2013 embarrassed that I\u2019m having to rely on my parents, embarrassed that I have access to this resource, and angry that even with all that resource you end up living in something that\u2019s only just adequate.\u201d For Laura Nelson, a 36-year-old content designer, being able to buy her home thanks to a \u00a35,000 gift from her grandparents meant freedom from having to move again. \u201cIn the 15 years I\u2019ve lived in Brighton, I\u2019ve had 10 or 11 addresses. Having to move every single year is really annoying. And I had an illegal cat, so to be able to live without the fear of my landlord discovering was a big thing.\u201d Many beneficiaries face another dilemma: talking about it or not. Revealing they had help might invite envy, yet not doing so might make friends wanting to buy a house believe they were doing something wrong, Jones said. And there are family secrets \u2013 one new homeowner who had help from relatives is not allowed to talk to her cousins about their support, since the others will not get help on the basis that their parents are rich enough already. Dr Liz Moor, an academic at Goldsmiths, University of London, conducted research on how people reconciled receiving parental gifts with the idea of living in a meritocratic society, something most supported. People were understandably defensive. \u201cThey tended to try and recast the gift as evidence of meritocratic progress for the family as a whole,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they tried to tell a story where their parents or grandparents had come from much more humble, working-class roots than they themselves did; that they\u2019d had to work hard, save hard, be careful with money in order to get enough money to buy property of their own. \u201cMy co-author and I know that story \u2013 it\u2019s one we told ourselves. But that story got a bit tricky when we started to ask about friends, because it becomes clear it\u2019s not about how hard you\u2019re working \u2013 it\u2019s about unfairness and arbitrariness as to who gets housing security and who doesn\u2019t.

One mother\u2019s hands were \u201craw and red\u201d, recalls Katrina Morley, its chief executive. \u201cShe and her husband had five jobs between them,\u201d Morley explains. \u201cShe was hand-washing the children\u2019s uniforms regularly and they were turning up to school immaculate, but the detergent was eating away at her hands.\u201d Morley says \u201cwhite goods poverty\u201d \u2013 particularly families without working washing machines or cookers \u2013 is now an area of desperate unseen need. She says the trust tries to negotiate with council teams or connect families with charities who can help. They have pastoral teams who build relationships with families, while staff are always on hand to talk at the school gates, and often the school will be the only trusted or available place for parents to turn for help. Morley adds that all their schools have washing machines and those that have showers are also used for pupils struggling to wash at home. This trust educates some of the poorest communities in the country. On average, schools in England have nearly 24% of pupils on free school meals, but in these schools between 69% and 97% of pupils are eligible. Sean Harris, who leads on improvement, research and innovation at TVE, and is an expert on poverty in schools, says it\u2019s not as simple as saying quality teaching will fix everything: \u201cIf a child is hungry and not cared for it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a bloody good teacher.\u201d He believes that in order to deliver \u201cdeep social justice\u201d, schools have to do \u201cdeep social listening\u201d to understand what their children are living through, without making assumptions. \u201cThat\u2019s hard in education when you\u2019re really busy,\u201d he admits. Both he and Morley grew up in poverty, but the trust educates its teachers about what children are experiencing. Alongside lack of food, lack of sleep has become a big issue. Morley says some children don\u2019t have a bed, while others share a bed with siblings. Some can\u2019t sleep because they don\u2019t have enough bedding in an unheated property and they\u2019re cold. Others can\u2019t sleep because they are anxious. The trust knows sleep deprivation, like hunger, is likely to impact a child\u2019s ability to focus and retain information, and they work with regional charities to pull in help. This winter, as fuel prices soared, pastoral teams discreetly donated blankets. Many kids are shouldering a lot. \u201cSometimes parents are trying to hold down three or four or five different jobs and the child might be taking younger siblings to school or putting food on the table,\u201d Morley says. The trust\u2019s magazine for parents focuses on low-income activities and cooking on a budget. They have drop-in coffee mornings and give parents free breakfasts, as a chance to open up dialogue about where they need help. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving them some dignity,\u201d Morley says.

I don\u2019t want to get on a soap box, yet we ought to surely be thinking about it, at some level, most of the time now,\u201d said Nero Gold prize winner Murray, whose tragicomic saga was also shortlisted for last year\u2019s Booker prize. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned that there are some new books that don\u2019t address it at all. What does it mean to ignore it? After all, I\u2019m a Catholic, but I don\u2019t think even that religion could invent something inspiring so much guilt. I mean, every time you turn on a light!\u201d Murray was talking to the Observer in his first interview since winning the \u00a330,000 prize for Book of the Year at the inaugural awards. The annual competition has filled the gap left by the prestigious former Costa prize, an award that ran for 50 years and was initially known as The Whitbread. Murray\u2019s novel, which topped the fiction category a month ago, was then pitted against the other category winners, including Scottish writer Fern Brady\u2019s non-fiction memoir, Strong Female Character. Also in contention for the overall winner\u2019s prize at last Thursday night\u2019s London ceremony were the debut novel, Close to Home, by Michael Magee, and the children\u2019s story, The Swifts, by Beth Lincoln. The judges, led by Booker winner Bernardine Evaristo, included writers Sara Collins, Sarfraz Manzoor, Anthony Quinn and Dave Rudden. Concern about climate change is woven through The Bee Sting, which follows two generations of an Irish family as they struggle to stay on track while keeping dangerous personal secrets. It has proved both a popular and critical hit since its publication by Hamish Hamilton last June and this weekend Murray revealed that negotiations to bring his rollercoaster story to the screen are well under way. \u201cA plan to serialise it as a drama for television is in the works,\u201d he said. The character of Willie, a minor hero of the novel who stays chiefly off stage, is given one stirring political speech about climate change that Murray admits does \u201cslightly break the fourth wall\u201d and which expresses many of his own views. \u201cWillie is being a politician at that point, and is wooing a crowd, but I agree with much of it,\u201d he said. Murray, 49, was born in Dublin and in his early 20s took up a place on the renowned creative writing course at the University of East Anglia. Recent funding threats to the course, which in the past has produced writers such as Kazuo Ishiguro, Tracy Chevalier and Ian McEwan, have shocked him, he said. \u201cI\u2019d be very sorry to ever see it go. I can\u2019t understand why this government would want to allow this assault on the university system. I wrote my first novel there and it literally changed my life. I was taught by Ali Smith, who is a genius, but also very generous, as she told her editor about my book.\u201d Murray believes the looming threat to writers posed by the speedy progress of artificial intelligence should also not be underestimated: \u201cIt seems the whole of human communication is being assailed now, perhaps because the leaders of the tech industry have no conception of what it is to be human, or what sincerity is. They can\u2019t own it, so they want to get rid of it.\u201d Literary fiction, Murray consoles himself, might still be safer than other forms of writing: \u201cIt will soon be possible to fake up novels better and better, but what for? When you read you connect with an author, with their intimate experience of life, and that is something you can\u2019t get in any other way.\u201d Working on The Bee Sting was enjoyable, Murray said, although he admits that its tense denouement \u2013 one that has troubled many readers \u2013 was \u201cvery hard\u201d to write. \u201cI tried out all sorts of epilogues, where things would be clarified. In my mind it was all very clear. But they didn\u2019t work.

Please, I thought, I\u2019ve unwound nine-tenths of my mortal coil, don\u2019t tell me about getting old, young whippersnapper. One glaring difference in the two decades that stand between us is underlined by the fact a 60-year-old male probably hasn\u2019t experienced ageism yet. A fit man at that age is not far off his social and cultural peak; dress him in a suit and he could be a minister of the crown or a hot-shot CEO. A woman \u2013 and in most cases, a man nearing his 80s \u2013 is more than likely just the furniture of the street; only her peer group really sees her as an equal. Although we might rail against being the wallpaper of the modern age and whinge about being patronised, younger members of society should still feel free to give up that bus seat or let us jump the queue. Chances are our legs aren\u2019t too strong any more. These things are as nothing compared with the horror Proust evokes when describing the impact the \u201cchemistry of time\u201d has had on his own idiosyncratic and once-vital characters. His descriptions of decrepitude send one rushing to the mirror. It becomes best not to dwell on the way body fat coalesces into a soccer-ball stomach almost overnight; nor to notice how cheeks have travelled down to swell a turkey neck; nor how cement, not fairy dust, seems to have been sprinkled on wrinkles. But etched in the aged faces and bodies of my friends are lifetimes of experience and wisdom, and when they smile and laugh, the cliche comes alive \u2013 I see the carefree young people they were. They grew in the lace-curtained middle of the last century, some with fathers who had been to war. All lived through what some think was the golden age of Australia and also through times of accelerating social change. I think especially of the women riding the wave of their ninth decade now \u2013 what a generation of women this was and is. We were formed by key social events of the times \u2013 the advent of TV, the swinging 60s, the pill, the Vietnam war, Vatican II, second-wave feminism \u2026 and that just takes us to the beginning of the 80s. I think of our parents\u2019 generation which faced greater challenges \u2013 world wars, the depression \u2013 and I think of the struggles of my ancestors, of the brave matriarchy that preceded me. Like many, what I do know is that the centrepiece of life is family, the one anchor that has kept me afloat in often challenging seas. To watch one\u2019s children grow and then their children \u2013 as one generation gives away to another \u2013 fulfils a deep primal need. Between the joy and the tears is the contentment of love. After a rollercoaster ride through life, now as I get older, it is the quiet in a noisy world that I find peaceful. A house that was once a chaotic pit stop for a hard-working single mother and kids is now an ordered haven of stillness. I rode the rollercoaster too often and now like the feeling of my feet on the ground. I no longer really love talking to strangers, for to talk to strange people may be to talk to dull people. Sure, behind everyone is a story but some of them I no longer have time to read. Many people live lives dominated by the metronome of habit. When Proust speaks of the \u201ctorpor of habit\u201d surely he is warning us that the constant daily wheel of repetition has rendered some constrained. A standout gift of ageing is time \u2013 time to be still, to notice the shapes and colours of the world, to remember, to understand our failures so that we might empathise with others. My memory bank is like Jack Horner\u2019s plum pudding, only a fabled magic one. I put in my thumb and pull out some long-forgotten joy or near miss and they keep on coming, too fast to catalogue. Being in the late evening of life we learn to reflect, to meditate on things lost and things gained, to contemplate a society alien to the one we knew as children. We still miss old dead mates, so many of them now that I keep a digital roll call of the dead who coloured my life. Some of those who are left have become impatient and cranky, best enjoyed in small doses. These are the ones who\u2019ve had enough, waiting to go, melancholy masked by mannerisms. Being on the cusp of one\u2019s ninth decade does not mean that engagement in the world is less. There is yin yoga, exercise, daily coffee with local friends. Importantly, keeping the grey matter active there is intellectual, cultural and political talk with engaged mates discussing the frailties of today\u2019s world and perhaps even gossiping about a former tall poppy or two. Currently there is the weekly flag-waving march through the city in opposition to this dreadful war on Gaza. A trip to ancient Greece and probably my farewell visit to Florence and Rome are in the planning. As I slide towards my ninth decade there are many things I regret. I regret that I did not stop and breathe more often; that I was not kinder more often; that I sometimes suffered fools for too long. I regret not knowing the constellations of the night sky, comparative mythology, how to speak Italian and Arabic fluently, how to ride a motorbike, play mahjong and dance tango. Then there are all the books I have not read \u2013 many of which sit beside my bed. Some days this list seems endless. The young 60-year-old writer has rich times ahead of him. Family, friends, knowledge, wisdom \u2013 the rich tapestry of life to enjoy. One day he will join those of us on the very slippery slope, rising unsteadily from the cafe chair, an hour of life measured out in Prufrock\u2019s coffee spoons, souls on the edge of transit, revelling in the kaleidoscope of memories and in plans for the next exciting feasible adventure.

After war work in a factory, it was back to business as usual for Howes, albeit with a skeleton staff. If \u2018outside, the old social order was peeling\u2019, inside, the fun wasn\u2019t quite over.

Of course, Howes served at his own retirement party.

And for good reason. We look after our oysters with religious zeal. Because oysters can cause a lot of problems: there should be a warning sign at certain times of the year, especially when a lot of people won\u2019t keep them in the filtration baths for around 36 hours. And our oysters come straight to us from the coast. We don\u2019t deal with a middleman, so we know where things come from.

Let\u2019s be clear: the Irish know how to celebrate. We spend it like sailors on leave, the English hoard it like misers. You know that and I know that: we don\u2019t want to insult each other. But I don\u2019t like it to be just this beer-swilling alcohol day. You\u2019re not going to see me wrapped in your shamrock and greens and singing fucking Molly Malone, that\u2019s not really me. I try to stay away from ultra fine dining restaurants. I like going to Paris, but when you get the bill, you want to cry.

On the serene title track of her sixth album, Deeper Well, the Nashville-based country crossover star, known for singing about her love of smoking weed, admits that she has given it up. Within that admission, and the song\u2019s delicate, pared-back pop-country arrangement, is the promise of a more clarified, mature iteration of Musgraves, and sometimes that\u2019s what Deeper Well provides. On Lonely Millionaire, which samples a song by the rapper JID, she invokes the shallowness of fame and wealth with the earnest but acerbic sparkle that filled her previous album, jaded divorce record Star-Crossed. At other times it seems as if this gesture towards maturity has instead resulted in a tilt into the generic: Heart of the Woods is the kind of community-minded ballad that sizzled on earlier Musgraves albums but here feels sapped of specificity. Elsewhere, songs such as Jade Green are so focused on the minutiae of her life as to feel tedious. She finds a delicate balance between the two, though, on Anime Eyes, a dizzying, almost comically lovestruck track that finds Musgraves eschewing the tasteful zen of the rest of the album in favour of all-out lyrical maximalism.

Eliding three books into one, she explores her own terrifying mental collapse and tentative recovery, the lives of Romantic poet William Wordsworth, his sister Dorothy and their confr\u00e8re Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the efforts to preserve the Wordsworths\u2019 cottage at Grasmere within the context of the Lake District as a whole. At times, the reader may feel a little too aware of the compression mechanism at work, but the book is nonetheless alive with fascinating episodes and potted histories and, even more importantly, a heartfelt commitment to the power of place and of poetry to sustain lives and minds. Grasmere was not Rutter\u2019s first attempt to transport herself to an entirely unfamiliar landscape and thereby to find a new direction for her life. As a 21-year-old, she set off to teach English in a small Japanese village, living alone in a rented apartment with very little Japanese at her disposal. This was not a grand gap year adventure born of a privileged upbringing \u2013 Rutter writes effectively about the challenges and ruptures in her familial environment \u2013 but an attempt to get close up to another culture and way of being. And it was working, until she suffered a sudden breakdown of her mental health, a sort of dissolution of the self: severe anxiety attacks, agitation and a deep-seated feeling in her body that \u201chappiness would for ever pass me by\u201d. Within a couple of weeks, she had been admitted to a psychiatric facility, where she was shown great kindness but remained unclear as to the path toward diagnosis and treatment; and then, an abrupt return home. In one sense, she was back where she started; in another, she was profoundly and permanently altered. Where does Wordsworth come in? After a period of recuperation \u2013 and with the jury still out on how lasting and durable the improvement would be \u2013 Rutter applied to become one of an annual group of interns who spend a year working at Dove Cottage, the small, white house in Cumbria in which William and Dorothy lived for many years. Determinedly ungrand, the cottage saw the composition of some of the former\u2019s greatest work, including early incarnations of his long, autobiographical poem The Prelude, which was not published until 1850, the year of his death. It is this astonishing work, a breathtakingly ambitious synthesis of introspection and outward-facing inquiry, that invokes the possibility of having the Earth \u201call before me\u201d and confronting it \u201cWith a heart / Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty\u201d. Rutter got the job, despite \u2013 and perhaps even because of \u2013 crying in the interview, and embarked on a year devoted to helping with Dove Cottage\u2019s upkeep, its guided tours and programme of poetry readings. It\u2019s hardly surprising when the highly particular nature of the work combines with the awe-inspiring beauty of the landscape to produce an intense feeling of connection; but Rutter senses something even more fundamental. What she is experiencing, she begins to realise, is a manifestation of \u201ckith\u201d \u2013 a feeling of being oneself in a place, at home in both body and mind. All Before Me also explores how William and Dorothy, who had been separated in childhood following the death of their mother, created their own home, after several false starts (there is a particularly compelling account of their season in Germany, when they were all but abandoned by Coleridge, who went off with some other pals and left brother and sister freezing and virtually penniless). It was in Grasmere that the Wordsworths began to link natural beauty with community and creativity, an identification with place that makes the tiny settlement of Townend feel to visitors not merely a stop on the literary tourist trail but the embodiment of a greater artistic impulse. William and Dorothy did not spend all of their lives in Grasmere, and nor does Rutter; but she shows how once somewhere has got inside you, it\u2019s quite possible to take it with you to pastures new. \u2022 All Before Me: A Search for Belonging in Wordsworth\u2019s Lake District by Esther Rutter is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).

It\u2019s addictive.\u201d It was a brave moment of exploration that followed the hardest period of Bishop\u2019s life. Three years earlier, his wife, Janet, had died of ovarian cancer. The pair met in 1959, at a mountaineering club in Hull, when he was just 17. \u201cI saw this beautiful girl and had no idea how to talk to her, but I eventually gathered the courage,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was the first girl I\u2019d ever kissed and we fell in love. A few years later, we were married.\u201d The couple had four children, nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. They enjoyed an active life, filling holidays with sailing, skiing and hiking. Then, in April 2020, Janet suddenly succumbed to the cancer she had been diagnosed with two years previously. \u201cIt got very serious in only a matter of weeks. Since it was the start of the Covid lockdowns, it was very isolating,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to have an unattended cremation and it was a grim time for everyone.\u201d Home alone, without the person he had always turned to for support, Bishop went for daily walks in the nearby Yorkshire Dales and tried to write about his experiences. \u201cIt distanced me from the pain,\u201d he says. \u201cIt put it elsewhere for a while, on to the page, since no one can live with that amount of anguish forever.\u201d He had given up skiing a decade earlier out of fear of taking a bad fall and doing irreparable damage to his body, but he found himself longing for the experience of being on the mountainside again. \u201cI wanted to find a way of getting back to the outdoors, to experience the wind and the majestic views,\u201d he says. \u201cI also needed it socially. When you have spent a lifetime talking to a lovely woman, the silence becomes very present.\u201d A mountaineering friend offered a solution. He suggested that Bishop try snowshoeing, a low-impact activity that would allow him to walk to high altitudes without the risks of skiing. He called up the leaders of a forthcoming week-long expedition being organised by the UK branch of the Austrian Alpine Club; they assured him that if he could walk, he could snowshoe. By March 2023, Bishop was in the Tirol mountains in the Alps with a dozen strangers from across Europe and a trained leader. \u201cIt was really strenuous activity, walking up to eight hours a day, but I had the most wonderful time,\u201d he says. \u201cPlus, I was with a fantastic selection of people from their 40s upwards, all open-minded, generous and keen to share this experience together.\u201d Learning mountain-rescue techniques and methods for spotting signs of avalanches while he walked, Bishop was enthused by the combination of physical and mental challenges. When he returned home, he booked another week-long expedition for the next winter. \u201cSince it\u2019s so active, the snowshoeing trips have encouraged me to get healthier and do 20 squats every morning, as well as regular tai chi and pilates,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I can maintain fitness in my older years and it\u2019s a tremendous ego boost \u2013 the leader of the December trip called me inspirational!\u201d His family are keen for him to keep going. \u201cThey joke that it\u2019s the way I\u2019d want to go anyway, so they\u2019re great supporters,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough none of them have been tempted to take a trip with me yet.\u201d Bishop has another expedition planned for this month. This time, he is training to become an assistant, leading beginners on walks. He hopes to undertake a more strenuous hike in Finland, with stops in alpine huts inside the Arctic Circle. \u201cI got hooked on this whole mountaineering thing when I was 17, so I\u2019ll keep going as long as my joints will allow me,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we get older, we might drift out of sight a bit, but it\u2019s our time to do whatever we please.

Shakspeare is not our poet, but the world\u2019s, Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee, Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale, No man hath walkt along our roads with step So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue So varied in discourse. But warmer climes Give brighter plumage, stronger wing: the breeze Of Alpine highths thou playest with, borne on Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, where The Siren waits thee, singing song for song. One of the Victorian poets usually, and mistakenly, categorised as \u201cminor\u201d, Walter Savage Landor was a rare early supporter of the unquestionably major writer, Robert Browning. A comparison of birth dates shows the age difference between the poets to have been considerable: Landor (1775-1864), Browning (1812-1889). Landor\u2019s sonnet gains something in human stature from being an unstinted response by a senior poet to one much younger. The admiration, it should be said, was mutual. A long friendship evolved, and Landor, who spent a number of years in Italy, would receive support from the Browning family during his chaotic later life. First published in the Morning Chronicle in 1845, To Robert Browning is an unrhymed sonnet \u2013 very unusual for the mid-19th century. Solidly crafted in iambic pentameter, it plays syntax against line with the fluency of a classically trained poet and dramatist: I think few readers would be distracted by the want of a rhyme-scheme chiming through the soundscape. But it\u2019s not predictably smooth: Landor clearly and memorably states his regard for Browning\u2019s energy and variety (lines seven to 10) and takes on some of the formal challenge. The sonnet moves quickly and broadly in its thought, with a delayed \u201cturn\u201d in line 10 introducing what is almost a fresh start. Landor begins with a characteristic flourish of aphorism. The lively generalisation in the paired couplets unites the two poets across their contrasting situations. Browning had published Sordello (1840) and might have felt like the singer none could hear as he confronted its reception. And Landor himself is, of course, the \u201cpraiser\u201d looking up and seeing the younger poet \u201cfar above\u201d \u2013 and not feeling at all disgruntled. The emphasis is on the \u201cdelight\u201d of the unheard singer and the inferior admirer: no frustration or envy sours Landor\u2019s genial sight. This is not to suggest there\u2019s no element of playfulness, but it enters by the back doors of spelling, resulting in a faintly mock-archaic tone. On the spelling of Shakespeare, Landor\u2019s choice was not an unusual one at the time of writing but other choices seem rather deliberately mannered: \u201cwalkt\u201d for instance, and \u201chighths\u201d. This flicker of irony allows Landor to smile in an elder-brotherly way at a notion of poetry which Browning himself might have more scornfully smiled at. Landor sees it as a form of high style \u2013 a kind of antiquing that lifts the tribute he\u2019s composing, although he smiles. Dispatching Browning from the local English roads to \u201cwarmer climes\u201d, Landor sees a gain in \u201cbrighter plumage, stronger wing\u201d \u2013 a triumphant vision, since the wing is strong enough to bear the weight of the bright plumage. Browning had already visited Italy to research Sordello, and he would live there from the beginning of his marriage to Elizabeth Barrett in 1846. Landor seems to view the younger poet\u2019s travels in terms of further future possibility. Could he have known about the marriage plans already? If he had, his reference to the waiting Siren might possibly be a mischievous reference to Elizabeth Barrett Browning-to-be. If she is going to match Robert \u201csong for song\u201d might she be competition as well as inspiration? I think the vision, whether it indeed includes Browning\u2019s future wife or refers to a merely mythological Siren, is more generous than that. With just a ghost of a rhyme (\u201con\u201d / \u201csong\u201d) to underline the jest, the sonnet closes in a further vision of the \u201cdelight in singing\u201d, a delight that this time is to be shared.", "date": "2024-03-18", "section": "Books", "author": "Carol Rumens", "id": 294, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2216d81fb18d751e47a10113c0123bb5aefee0f5/608_736_2707_1624/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Comeback tour: why we should applaud Netflix for saving Girls5Eva ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/mar/18/girls5eva-season-3-netflix", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.119, "neu": 0.613, "pos": 0.268, "compound": 0.997}, "body": "Very quietly, without much publicity or promotion, Girls5Eva appeared on Netflix last week. For those of us who haven\u2019t kept their eye on the ball, this came as an immense surprise. Because as far as we were concerned, Girls5Eva was dead. At the end of its second season a year and a half ago, the show\u2019s original platform Peacock announced that it would not renew the show. And we made our peace with that. Written by Meredith Scardino, a storied writer with credits on SNL and The Colbert Report, Girls5Eva at times seemed almost too beautiful to live. A sitcom about four middle-aged women determined to reform their noughties girl group and recapture a flicker of their old fame, it was not only dense with every form of joke imaginable \u2013 never has a show revelled quite so much in the background sight gag \u2013 but at times weirdly touching. Produced by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, it shared an innate DNA with 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It was fast and precise, and boasted a murderer\u2019s row of talent. Some of the cast you knew would be good. Busy Philipps is as reliable a comedy performer as you are ever likely to find, with a face elastic enough to convey a full spectrum of confusion and disgust, and Paula Pell has spent years looking for a breakout vehicle like this. But others were a total coin toss. The ostensible lead of the show was the earnest piano balladeer Sara Bareilles, a woman who did not seem like a natural fit for screwball comedy, and yet turned out to be brilliant. And then there was Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, best known for playing Angelica Schuyler in Hamilton, who was absolutely revelatory as the absurd narcissist Wickie Roy. It\u2019s absurd that you can be in Hamilton and then find a star-making role, but that\u2019s exactly what Goldsberry did with Girls5Eva. If you were reluctant to watch initially, it\u2019s worth it just to see the levels of mania she is able to hit. And now you have another chance. It\u2019s slightly surprising that Netflix picked up Girls5Eva. Long gone are the days when Netflix would swoop in and rescue any vaguely beloved show that looked like it might be in trouble. Now it has a habit of cutting shows off in their prime, unless millions of diehard fans are prepared to dedicate their entire lives to relentlessly pestering executives for a renewal. And Girls5Eva definitely did not have that. It had fans, yes, but it was a show for adults with busy lives that didn\u2019t leave any room for annoying letter-writing campaigns. But here we are. Girls5Eva is back, and more or less as good as it ever was. The comeback season is structured around the group\u2019s first tour following their new album. We find them in residence at Fort Worth, where they have fallen into a rut of fan service, singing long renditions of one song about the town, beefed up with tracts from Wikipedia and chants of \u201cFuck Dallas\u201d. It\u2019s comfortable but unfulfilling work, and they need to break out. The ensuing tour takes them to Wickie\u2019s home, where the group learns the truth about her hardscrabble upbringing (spoiler: her parents are good at Scrabble, which is hard) and visit a rich fan to be confronted about the casual insensitivity of their early-noughties hits. It\u2019s just as quick and absurd as it ever was. One joke about tooth whiteners might be the best we see on screen all year. Which isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s perfect, of course. The new season has got a little too giddy about being on Netflix, and has become improbably dirty in the process. It\u2019s jarring the first time a character says \u201cdick\u201d, purely because we had 16 episodes where nobody did that, but it\u2019s soon followed by a kaleidoscope of filthy language. I can\u2019t remember an American show that uses the C-word so readily (including once in a musical number). Which isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s morally wrong, but the series sits in such a heightened, sunny, day-glo space that the swearing can take you out of the world a little. Also, this might just be me, but the return of Girls5Eva has made me ever so slightly resentful that Netflix didn\u2019t also decide to renew Tina Fey and Robert Carlock\u2019s other lost masterpiece, Great News. But these are quibbles. Girls5Eva is back, and in this media landscape we should treat it as the miracle that it is.

Now she has developed this into a tender, intimate, funny and entirely absorbing full-scale feature documentary, the title of which is a reference to the central circuit board on a computer \u2013 meaning perhaps both the importance of the digital equipment she\u2019s using to record everything, and her own central importance to the computer of their own family unit, the motherboard that isn\u2019t allowed to go wrong or take a day off. Motherboard is essentially a home video love letter to her son Jim that crafts 20 years\u2019 worth of footage, showing her own life and that of Jim growing surreally from a tiny baby into a fiercely opinionated, smart young adult who suddenly towers over the parent. The film lasts around 90 minutes, which is about how long the growing up process seems to take in real life for a parent. And at the same time she has to deal with exhaustion, a breast cancer diagnosis, anxiety and her own complex relationship with her father who walked out on the family when she was still young. Richard Linklater\u2019s famous time-lapse film, showing a kid growing up over three hours, was called Boyhood; Mapplebeck\u2019s could be called Motherhood or Sonhood or Lifehood. It is confessional, and hyperlocal in its 4K-rendered detail; it is a richly satisfying, humane, sympathetic study at the end of which I felt I knew Victoria and Jim as well as if they lived next door. Mapplebeck\u2019s camera seems always to be there, a fly on the wall of her own life: she appears dedicated \u2013 even ruthless \u2013 in her commitment to placing the camera where it can capture her, even in the most unflattering way. There is a startling, surreal shot of Mapplebeck having radiotherapy, the camera placed at her head and looking down her foreshortened body, glowing in a clinical light. She also gives us a brutally powerful confessional scene in which she says she wants to stay alive while Jim is still a child: \u201cI don\u2019t care when I die; I just want to see him get to adulthood.\u201d There is also something very touching in the insights she gets from Jim about his feelings on meeting with his dad: \u201cI\u2019m going to be sad; even if it goes well, I\u2019m still going to be sad.\u201d It\u2019s a film that works because it doesn\u2019t strain for anything other than its own personal record, and it has a marvellous humanity and warmth. \u2022 Motherboard screened at the Copenhagen documentary film festival", "date": "2024-03-18", "section": "Film", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "id": 296, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2d73ae5835161f0b738dbf5ba527d27a893622/0_104_1772_1063/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Idris Elba reveals \u2018dream\u2019 of building eco city on island off Sierra Leone", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/18/idris-elba-reveals-dream-of-building-eco-city-on-island-off-sierra-leone", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.029, "neu": 0.714, "pos": 0.257, "compound": 0.9984}, "body": "Idris Elba has shared details of his \u201cdream\u201d to turn an island off the coast of Sierra Leone, the country where his father was born, into an environmentally friendly smart city. The actor is working with his childhood friend to develop Sherbro, which is roughly the size of the Isle of Man, after the island was given enough autonomy by the west African nation\u2019s government to allow the work to go ahead. \u201cOriginally, we went there thinking how could we bring tourism to the most incredible 19 miles of beachfront,\u201d Elba told the BBC. But his friend Siaka Stevens said it became apparent Sierra Leone was not yet prepared for such an influx of tourists. Instead, the pair \u2013 who grew up together in east London \u2013 decided to embark on a more ambitious project. Their company, Sherbro Alliance Partners (SAP), has reached agreements with the Sierra Leonean government, as well as several major firms, to build an eco city as a public-private partnership. They have agreed a deal with the energy company Octopus to build Sierra Leone\u2019s first windfarm on the island, which lacks mains electricity and is a two-hour ferry trip from the mainland. Elba said a sustainable approach to developing the project would be central throughout the development. Equally important will be respecting local culture and sensibilities, with Elba expressing his hope to create a \u201cculturally diverse international city that blends African tradition, dynamism, and pride with state-of-the-art infrastructure and services\u201d. \u201cThe character of the island hopefully will remain intact. It\u2019s a beautiful, green part of the world and we don\u2019t want to disturb that,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s about being self-reliant, it\u2019s about bringing an economy that feeds itself and has growth potential. I\u2019m very keen to reframe the way Africa is viewed \u2026 as an aid model. This opportunity is completely different.\u201d He and Stevens have defined three key principles for the project. Among them is developing \u201cbased on African cultural values and principles, which prioritise community, collaboration, and respect for nature\u201d. They also said they planned to design the infrastructure in a way that was adaptable to \u201cchanging social, economic and environmental conditions\u201d and to follow \u201ceco city principles\u201d, such as building in a way that is \u201cenvironmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and resilient to climate change\u201d. Stevens said that the development on the island would be \u201cfuelled by clean energy sources\u201d. The pair said they had also sought to consult residents of the island; saying they have each visited several times to meet local leaders. Last month, Lloyds of London announced it was to take up a role in the project, but said at the time that Stevens and Elba\u2019s company was still in the process of putting together feasibility studies with the government of Sierra Leone. Elba and Stevens have said they hoped to break ground on the project within about a year of those studies starting, but they have stressed that this is a process that is likely to last decades. Feasibility is a key question for the project, for which SAP reportedly hopes to raise billions of dollars from various sources. The US-Senegalese singer Akon is another artist who announced a plan to build a futuristic city in his ancestral homeland. The first phase of his project was due to be completed by late last year. But, as the Guardian reported in December, the project has been beset by delays and controversy \u2013 with only a youth centre and the shell of what is planned to be the \u201cwelcome centre\u201d having been built so far. While Akon received praise for the planned city\u2019s Afrofuturistic aesthetic, there has been scepticism as to whether it will ever come to pass, fuelled by a lack of detail around the plans. Elba, for his part, has been clear about where his strengths lie. \u201cNever in my lifetime would I have thought I could build the foundation for a new smart-city \u2026 I\u2019m not qualified for that. But I am qualified to dream big,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream, you know, but I work in the make-believe business.\u201d He added: \u201cPart of me wants to build that beautiful retirement home for my mum.\u201d The actor told the broadcaster his late father would probably think the dream too big. But he said he would be proud, and tell his son \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do it, make sure you do it properly.

I didn\u2019t know what was happening\u201d. Blair, the former baseball player in the postwar women\u2019s league which inspired the 1992 film A League of Their Own, was on stage at the 2022 Tribeca film festival in New York, since she had been involved in Amazon\u2019s TV adaptation. She looked around and wondered why she was still hiding. Although her sexuality had not been a secret among her teammates, she decided there and then to publicly come out at the age of 95. \u201cOut of the clear blue sky, I just blurted out \u2018I want everybody to know\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI was in the closet for 95 years. That old door blew open. I was sitting there, my eyes wide open, mouth open probably. I thought, \u2018Oh my God, after 95 years, you said that?\u2019 And I did. I wasn\u2019t afraid any more because I was so old and it really didn\u2019t matter, except for my family, what people thought.\u201d The audience cheered. \u201cAfterwards, I sat down and I had a beer and I tell you, I have never been so happy in all my life. I was a new girl at 95.\u201d She laughs, speaking on the phone from California. \u201cSo you might have me for 95 more years.\u201d It changed her life, she says. Now 97, she has been embraced by the LGBTQ+ community and invited to events, but what means the most to her is the people who tell her they have been inspired by her. \u201cThat made me feel so wonderful. So many people have told me how I helped them come out, and their families understand now what is going on in their lives.\u201d She hasn\u2019t had one person, \u201cto my face anyway\u201d, say anything negative. Blair played for the Peoria Redwings in the 1948 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season, then had a long career working for the aerospace company Northrop Corporation, where, at that time, she feared she would be fired if she was open about her sexuality. She was, she says, \u201cscared to death\u201d of anyone finding out the truth. \u201cIn those days, they had no sympathy for gay people. And I didn\u2019t know what my family would have thought. I couldn\u2019t do it. I had to go out on dates with men I didn\u2019t want to go out with. But I did \u2013 and I looked halfway decent, I think, because they kept asking me out. I just walked this straight and narrow path. It was hard sometimes, but I did it.\u201d She shrugged off comments from people wondering why she had never married, saying she hadn\u2019t found the right man. \u201cThat was my excuse.\u201d To finally be open changed her life, she says. \u201cYou have no idea. It was a new world for me.\u201d She wishes she had come out sooner, she says, but more than that, she wishes we had a society where she had felt able to: \u201cI would have liked to have come out right away if people would have accepted gay people.\u201d But now, she says, she has a new lease of life. \u201cThe music is playing real loud now for me, and every step I take is a little more lively now that I can be who I am.\u201d It has given her added energy to put into her current project: arranging for an international women\u2019s baseball centre to be built in Illinois. \u201cI think they should be able to have a home of their own for baseball. I\u2019ve got a few things I still have to do before I get six feet under.\u201d It is common, even desirable, to change your life in your 40s, 50s and 60s, but what is it like to embark on something new and different in your 90s? Edith Murway-Traina, who died last year at the age of 101, took up weightlifting in her 90s and became the oldest competitive power lifter at 99. Charles Eugster, a British dentist, started bodybuilding in his 80s and became a sprinter at 95; he died in 2017, at 97. Last month, David Marjot, 95, celebrated his graduation day at Kingston University, where he attained a master\u2019s in modern European philosophy, and is reportedly considering starting a PhD. These are the people showing it\u2019s never too late, and you\u2019re never too old. In 2022, Mildred Kirschenbaum became a social media star at the age of 99. She was on a cruise with her son and daughter to celebrate her birthday; her daughter, Gayle, posted a video of Kirschenbaum contemplating her age. She was lucky, she said, that \u201cI still have my marbles \u2026 and that I have a family who, I think, adores me. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d The video went viral. Then Kirschenbaum caught Covid, and in an update she told her fans, with typical verve, \u201cI am finished with this fucking Covid!\u201d In videos since then, she has sung, danced, reflected on her life and offered her thoughts, including on dealing with the hardships of childhood, and regrets (basically: don\u2019t dwell). She has recently published a book, Mildred\u2019s Mindset \u2013 part life advice, part memoir. Now 100, how does Kirschenbaum feel about becoming an influencer? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, slightly tetchily from her home in Florida \u2013 she\u2019s waiting to be picked up to go to her bridge game. \u201cI just don\u2019t think about it. I don\u2019t think about dying or anything. It\u2019s like, que sera, whatever will be, will be.\u201d Has she always had a good attitude to ageing? \u201cI don\u2019t think about ageing, I really don\u2019t. I can\u2019t believe how old I am.\u201d She has, however, always tried to have a positive attitude and to do new things, she says. \u201cI\u2019ll try anything, it doesn\u2019t matter. Within reason \u2013 tell me to climb up a mountain, I\u2019ll say no.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t like it when other older people say, \u201cI can\u2019t do this and I can\u2019t do that. They decide they\u2019re old, that\u2019s it. You\u2019re never too old to try something new, to learn something. I learn something new every single day.\u201d Kirschenbaum was born in Brooklyn in 1923. You don\u2019t, she observed in one of her videos, get to live a long life without a lot of heartache along the way. Her sister died of pneumonia as a child, her father tried to take his own life during the Great Depression, and in more recent years, Kirschenbaum coped with the death of one of her adult children, and her husband (to whom she was married for more than 60 years). She isn\u2019t fazed by her newfound celebrity status. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care at all, one bit,\u201d says Gayle, who lives in New York. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t have all that much meaning to her. She cares about happy hour, and playing cards, and her family. A good cruise is important, too.\u201d Gayle, a film-maker and forgiveness coach, previously made a documentary about the transformation of their relationship, from \u201cdifficult\u201d to loving. \u201cMy mission is to keep her going and to make sure she\u2019s happy,\u201d says Gayle. \u201cI love that she brings joy to people and she inspires people. I joke that I created a monster but God forbid I say anything bad about her, because her fans will come after me. They worship her.\u201d We should remember, says David Sinclair, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre UK, that many of us, should we make it into our 90s, will not be lucky enough to grab all life\u2019s opportunities. \u201cDementia and frailty and disability are extraordinarily high among people in their 90s,\u201d he says. \u201cThat story you sometimes see of the 90-year-old skydiver is extraordinarily rare. There\u2019s that caveat we have to think about.\u201d But he would also like to see a society where people are encouraged to live full and interesting lives, and try new things, into their 90s and beyond. \u201cFar too often we say to people, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to bother any more\u2019. It\u2019s ageist and patronising. I think we\u2019ve got to have more of a sense of what are the rights and responsibilities we should have, across our lives.\u201d There is, he says, \u201ca perception that you shouldn\u2019t try something new, and I think there is a self-imposed ageism\u201d. It\u2019s not always easy to overcome that, but \u201cwe should be finding ways to support people\u201d. Promoting healthy lifestyles earlier, and social connectedness, are obviously vital \u2013 but so is access to opportunities, such as adult education, which has been slashed. When a maths course for mature students was made available by his local authority, Derek Skipper jumped at the chance. In 2022, he passed his GCSE maths at the age of 92 \u2013 more than 75 years after he took the equivalent in the 1940s. For a couple of hours a week, he learned over Zoom and looked up extra YouTube tutorials (both of those online platforms were new to him). \u201cI found I was quite enjoying it,\u201d says Skipper, now 94. \u201cThe things that I did at school, which I had forgotten, started to come back a little bit. I found I was understanding maths. It was interesting. Just to realise how clever it is, something I hadn\u2019t understood before.\u201d He would love others to do the same. \u201cWhat a great benefit it would be to the country in general if parents were able to go back to college, learn a bit of maths so they can encourage their children. So many people say, \u2018I was hopeless at maths.\u2019 They might suddenly find it\u2019s not quite as bad as they thought.\u201d It was enough for Skipper, who had a career as a salesman, to have taken the GCSE and he says he isn\u2019t planning to do anything else with it, even if he still enjoys plotting graphs in his spare time. It gave his brain a workout. \u201cThe maths course kept me much more interested than sitting down watching television. You feel as though you\u2019re achieving something, you\u2019re learning something.\u201d Last year, Bronwyn Herbert finished her PhD at the University of Queensland, Australia, at the age of 90, and is working out what she wants to do next. Though first, she says, she needs to tidy her study. \u201cAnd pick up some of the friendships that I probably didn\u2019t have time to work on. There\u2019s always some \u2018something\u2019 to do,\u201d she says. Herbert was pregnant when she was widowed at 23. After her daughter was born, the first of four children, she went back to live with her family and her brother, a lecturer, told her of a new course in social work his university was launching. \u201cWhen my baby girl was old enough, I went back to university and started doing social work.\u201d Aside from taking time to raise her children, Herbert spent her career in social work, only retiring at 81 so she could think about doing a PhD. She had worked a lot with homeless families, and over her long career had seen the effects of generational homelessness. \u201cI wondered what we could have done differently to prevent this occurring. When I researched it, there was very little to read about what homeless children or grownups thought about how their lives have been affected. There was a big gap in the literature. I decided I needed to investigate that. So that\u2019s how I came to start my thesis.\u201d She completed it despite several difficult and traumatic events \u2013 Herbert had a heart operation, then a fall that put her in hospital for three months. Her adult son died in an accident, and then her husband died. \u201cI lost interest in it for a while. Anyhow, I got going again and I completed it.\u201d She is, she says, \u201cvery happy to have finished it\u201d. What has she learned about following her dreams in her 90s? \u201cI think if I set out to do something, I\u2019ve always then achieved it as much as I possibly could. I was just very delighted to live this long to achieve it. There\u2019s always a lot of things to do in life.\u201d There are parts of her thesis that she would like to develop and work on further, particularly around effective and good parenting, but she is still thinking about it. \u201cI look forward to a new challenge. I don\u2019t know what it is yet, but I\u2019ll be ready for it.\u201d Herbert seems like a youngster compared to Sarah Yerkes, who published her first collection of poetry at 101. Yerkes has always been creative \u2013 she was a landscape architect, then a sculptor, working into her 80s until the physical effort of sculpting became too much. When she moved to a retirement community in Washington DC in her 90s, she joined a poetry writing group and in 2019 published a collection of her poetry, Days of Blue and Flame, with reflections on creativity, as well as more emotional experiences in her long life, including the death of her five-year-old son. Celebrating her 104th birthday in 2022, she said writing had meant \u201ca whole new world had opened up\u201d. It was a \u201cnew occupation and a new group of friends\u201d. Yerkes will be 106 next month, and isn\u2019t up for a phone call, nor for answering many of my questions relayed via one of her daughters. But she did say that, to her, poetry was like sculpture: \u201cPutting things together.\u201d Then she laughed and added, \u201cWhat a cop-out.\u201d I\u2019d asked how she would define a good life. \u201cLots of love,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd hang on to it.\u201d \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The friend\u2019s father-in-law counselled that she should not choose pizza, since she had just had a baby and ought to lose weight. This incident inspired one of Stone\u2019s paintings, It\u2019s My Garden, Asshole: a gorgeous acrylic on canvas depicting a shimmering impressionistic garden held together with an undulating ground of salmon and De Kooning-esque pinks. So the father-in-law was the asshole, I ask? Not quite, explains the star during a video call from her California home. When Stone came to make the painting, a drone was hovering over her home. You can see a black smudge top left of the canvas. \u201cI was like, these people need to get the fuck out of our garden. They\u2019re so busy trying to spy on us that they don\u2019t even have any idea what\u2019s really happening.\u201d So this is angry painting, expressing outrage at patriarchal power and the erosion of privacy? \u201cNo! It\u2019s a love story!\u201d Stone explains that her friend had long struggled to have a child. \u201cWhen she had finally got her baby after going through so much, naturally she was upset at being told by some old white man to lose weight. I said to her \u2018Go tell him it is his last chance to be a grandfather and that you want him to love that child after everything it cost you.\u2019 And she did! And now they\u2019re best friends!\u201d Stone, 66, started painting during Covid when a friend gave her a paint-by-numbers book. Three years later she paints as much as 17 hours a day. She currently has a solo exhibition at a gallery in Berlin, and another opening in San Francisco next month. If that makes you feel like a slacker, console yourself with the thought that Stone would probably not have got gallery space were she not already famous. \u201cProbably not,\u201d concedes Stone, \u201cbut I would be more valuable if I were dead. If there is the possibility of a shorter life expectancy, that\u2019s a winner for female artists.\u201d Wait, what? She recalls taking her portfolio to a meeting with a New York gallery. \u201cAfter two hours I finally said, \u2018Are you gonna even look at my work?\u2019 And you know what he said? \u2018Are you planning to die soon?\u2019 So I said, \u2018I\u2019ve been sitting here for two hours listening to you and your friends for nothing?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d Stone knows she could make big bucks if only she gave galleries what they wanted. \u201cJohnny Depp is printing pictures of people, putting some paint over it and signing it, and making a fortune,\u201d she says. (Two years ago, Depp\u2019s debut art collection Friends and Heroes, consisting of 780 screen prints of the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Bob Dylan and Keith Richards, sold for an estimated $3.65m.) \u201cI had galleries approach me and say, \u2018Could you please make prints of your face?\u2019 I think it\u2019s my duty not to do that. It\u2019s my job to open a window for other women and hold it open further.\u201d That is what she did as an actor, she says, and is now doing as an artist. She tells me she is asking $40,000 a piece for some of her paintings. Apart from anything else, buyers will get a lot of surface area for their money. Stone often works on a grand scale. Take her 2023 abstract diptych Amelia. A vertiginous neo-geometric composition, it was inspired by what it must have been like for the pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart \u201cto be in the plane so long by herself, day after day, hour after hour\u201d. A cool $40,000 is certainly more than the 25 bucks Stone used to charge for the paintings she made as a teenager to put her through school. Little Sharon got the art bug from her Aunt Vonne in smalltown Pennyslvania. Her parents, Dorothy and Joseph, were, their daughter relates in her memoir The Beauty of Living Twice, not so much \u201clace-curtain Irish\u201d as \u201ckitchen-sink Irish\u201d. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t come from a loving parental home. My parents came from being child slaves,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father lived in a barn from the age of four; my mother was given away when she was nine to be a housekeeper, laundress and cook.\u201d Their tough upbringings shaped Stone\u2019s own childhood and character. \u201cYou got your work done before you got to play, before you got to eat. And if you didn\u2019t, you got your butt pulled out of bed and you got knocked down the stairs.\u201d Aunt Vonne offered an escape from that harsh world and catalysed Stone\u2019s lifelong love of art. \u201cPainting was just another language I grew up knowing, like if you grow up in a musical family.\u201d She studied at nearby Edinboro University, but gave up art for modelling. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the impression I was going to be able to survive as a painter. I was offered modelling jobs at $5,000 a day. So I was thinking: 25 bucks or 5,000?\u201d Modelling took her to New York and made her part of the Studio 54 crowd. Then one day in 1980 she stood in line to be an extra in Woody Allen\u2019s Stardust Memories, and got the non-speaking role of \u201cpretty girl on train\u201d. Her breakthrough came 10 years later, in Paul Verhoeven\u2019s sci-fi head-scratcher Total Recall. Two years after that, she worked with the Dutch director again on the endearingly silly erotic thriller Basic Instinct \u2013 even though he incessantly called her Karen. \u201cRemember what Marilyn Monroe said,\u201d says Stone: \u201cWomen who seek to be equal with men lack ambition.\u201d The quote is probably apocryphal but it\u2019s obvious why she likes it. The most intriguing characters on Sharon Stone\u2019s CV are ambitious women who don\u2019t so much want to be equal to men as to kick their asses. \u201cI was playing pretty big characters,\u201d she agrees. \u201cAbsolutely. I was standing beside the men instead of behind them.\u201d The role of which she is most proud is Ginger McKenna in Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1995 Casino, which she played opposite Robert De Niro. \u201cBob encouraged me in every possible way. It was so amazing to me that he told me his performance depended on my performance. I just did everything I could possibly do to serve him because it was my wish to get to work with him, and it came true.\u201d Her acting career has not reached those heights since. \u201cI was shocked that I didn\u2019t get to continue to work well, because I did everything to be my very best.\u201d Certainly she\u2019s had well documented problems with Hollywood misogyny: she recently revealed that during filming of the 1993 film Sliver, Hollywood producer Robert Evans advised her to have sex with co-lead William Baldwin to improve his performance (whether Evans thought the same means would have improved hers is moot). One key reason she has been less prominent in Hollywood in recent years, though, is because in 2001, two weeks after 9/11, Stone suffered a stroke caused by a brain haemorrhage, an event that inspired the title of her autobiography. \u201cWhen a door closes, I have to open another one,\u201d she says. \u201cMy book\u2019s been sold in 22 countries so far.\u201d Now she\u2019s writing a novel. She\u2019s a devotee of the wisdom of comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell, whose philosophy, encapsulated in the slogan \u201cfollow your bliss\u201d, prompted Stone to move from movie set to easel. \u201cIt made me get some decent brushes and remember what I thought I\u2019d forgotten.\u201d You really didn\u2019t paint for nearly half a century? \u201cI couldn\u2019t. I worked 307 days a year. When I wasn\u2019t on set, I was flying to the press junkets. I was home six days one year, nine days another. So no. I didn\u2019t paint.\u201d But now she does. Very quickly she has amassed a body of work in which one can see the influences of Joan Mir\u00f3, Monet (there\u2019s even one called Giverny, inspired by a trip to the Frenchman\u2019s garden) and Kandinsky. Stone says that, like Kandinsky, she feels a spiritual charge when she paints \u2013 though of Russian artists, she most admires Rodchenko. The press release for Stone\u2019s latest show quotes art historian Martin Oskar Kramer\u2019s assessment of her oeuvre: \u201cAn expression of the feminine that is deeply in touch with natural forces and fundamentally untameable.\u201d That perhaps helps explain why, in her most figurative works, snakes figure so prominently. As we talk I notice a table lamp behind Stone has a snake support. \u201cSnakes completely change their skins and move on,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe ability to change is a symbol of how smart you are.\u201d The Berlin show is called Totem. \u201cTotems often serve as monuments to resilience and strength,\u201d says Stone. \u201cThese paintings feel totemic to me. My daily art-making helps me fight my way out from under the weight of this alarming time we are all living through.\u201d Among the paintings she\u2019s exhibiting currently is one called Please Don\u2019t Step on the Grass. It was inspired by trips to Israel in 2006, and takes on new resonance since the 7 October attacks in Israel and subsequent devastation of Gaza. Its subjects are borders, invasions and the folly of conquest. \u201cBefore we start killing and maiming and wounding thousands of women and children, we need big brains, more emotional intelligence, not more small-penis energy. My painting is about all that.\u201d Is she happier as a painter than an actor? \u201cI\u2019m not saying that. Working as an actress, I absolutely loved it. If someone offers me a substantial role, I\u2019m going to take it. But that\u2019s not happening.\u201d Why not? \u201cWhat happens in the business is that once you become a huge seller, they want to put you in small projects, so that you start financing people who want to start their careers. Terrific, but that\u2019s not really where I\u2019m at. I want to work with the masters because I have earned my place there.\u201d She insists on being creative while her acting career is on hold. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to continue to be artistically creative, to let that faucet flow, so that your art stays ever present and modern.\u201d As if to prove the point, she tells me she\u2019s planning to spend the rest of the day on a painting for her new San Francisco show. She\u2019s in no hurry to go back to acting on other people\u2019s terms. \u2022 Sharon Stone: Totem is at Galerie Deschler, Berlin, until 18 May \u2022 Sharon Stone: My Eternal Failure opens at Gallery 181 at 181 Fremont Residences, San Francisco, on 11 April", "date": "2024-03-19", "section": "Film", "author": "Stuart Jeffries", "id": 299, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/143086e9a12d41f7adab2af7840d6e9b26fb8b60/0_168_5129_3077/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Putting the beauty of lifelong friendships into words | Letters", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/19/putting-the-beauty-of-lifelong-friendships-into-words", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.14, "neu": 0.505, "pos": 0.355, "compound": 0.9898}, "body": "We were heartened to read of Rhaina Cohen\u2019s new book on close platonic friendships, The Other Significant Others (\u2018She\u2019s my sacred other\u2019: is friendship, not romance, the key to a happy and fulfilled life?, 13 March), as it deals with many of the issues that we raised in our article published in the Guardian (First person, 22 November 2008), which explored our own strong and committed friendship.

Logically enough it is devoted to the final three sonatas, in C minor, D958, A major D959, and in B flat, D960, a triptych that Schubert completed in September 1828, two months before his death. Lewis is a wonderfully unfussy and straightforwardly lucid interpreter of these great works, judicious with his rubato, and never imposing unnecessary mannerisms on the music; whether structurally or texturally everything is consistently uncluttered. Turner Sims is a fine hall for piano recitals, and Lewis made the most of its clarity. And just as importantly, he was always at pains to allow the music the expressive space it requires, whether giving full weight to the silences that play such an important role in late Schubert, or letting the twists and shifts of the harmony work their magic. That harmonic awareness was just as important here in the closing bars of the A major\u2019s opening movement, where its assertive opening theme is finally recalled, but robbed of all its vigour, as it was in the moments of maximum intensity, such as the angry outbursts in the recitative-like sections of the same sonata\u2019s slow movement. With the possible exception of the B flat sonata\u2019s tinkling scherzo, there are very few unclouded passages in any of these works, but Lewis never overdid the anguish, so that when it did well up to the surface, its impact was all the greater. After such outstanding accounts of the first two sonatas, though, the performance of the B flat after the interval was not quite on the same compelling level. There was just a hint of routine about the unfolding of the long first movement, while the tolling of the Andante was not quite as heart-rending as it can be. But this is to measure it against the standard that Lewis had previously set himself and that was a very high mark indeed.

Despite the UK aiming to be the first country in the world to end new HIV cases, by 2030, our recent polling on public knowledge and attitudes makes for pretty grim reading.

The reality is that we\u2019ve made incredible progress in preventing, testing and treating HIV in the last 40 years. You can live a long, healthy life with HIV.

As the moustachioed hero leaps to her side, a text bubble reveals the name of our digitised damsel in distress: Princess Peach. She gives her thanks, the credits roll, and we bid her farewell. As you\u2019ll know if you watched Anna Taylor-Joy\u2019s performance in last year\u2019s Mario movie, the Mushroom Kingdom\u2019s monarch is rather less one-dimensional these days \u2013 as you\u2019d hope, given how video games and feminism have progressed over the past 40 years. But this is only the second game in which she has had a starring role, the first since 2005\u2019s DS game Super Princess Peach. Showtime puts Nintendo\u2019s pink princess literally in the spotlight, as a trip to the theatre goes awry and she must take to the stage to save the dramatic arts from \u2026 evil grapes? It\u2019s a strange but enjoyable setup, allowing Peach to dive into a litany of genre-themed side-scrolling levels. From sneaking through grass and running along rooftops as a dagger-clutching ninja Peach, to galloping on horseback across train tracks and lassoing bandits, each new theatrical backdrop offers the heroine another stage play to star in. It\u2019s all impressively handsome, too. With well-animated, screen-filling bosses and charmingly rendered cakes, Showtime\u2019s colourful visuals are delightful. Yet it only takes a few minutes of play before repetition sinks in. From mashing a button to stir cake mix as Patisserie Peach, to the simplistic jumping and combat that defines everything from swordfighting to superhero fisticuffs, Showtime\u2019s gameplay is thinner than the Paper Mario. A rare highlight here is the two ice-skating levels, which see a leotard-clad Peach carving her way across a whimsical winter wonderland. An action-packed kung fu vignette offers up a few smiles, too, the visuals lending an enjoyable level of kitsch to its rudimentary pummelling pastiche. The problem is, where the house of Mario normally nails the balance between depth and accessibility, Showtime feels shallow. Whether it\u2019s the diabolical mermaid levels or the laughably incomplete investigations of Detective Peach, many of these potentially fun ideas feel like prototypes that prematurely escaped Nintendo HQ. Last year\u2019s Super Mario Wonder was a delight for all ages, but Princess Peach: Showtime has little to offer those of us who have mastered our times tables. Its gorgeously scripted cinematic moments and visual variety provide colour and pomp, but it\u2019s a royal shame that the inventive animations and narrative setup aren\u2019t accompanied by the same level of gameplay innovation. Despite the enjoyable premise and high production values, Peach\u2019s long-awaited star turn feels disappointingly patronising, one-dimensional and forgettable \u2013 the polar opposite of the Super Mario Bros film\u2019s capable heroine. As the Nintendo Switch enters its twilight years, this was the perfect moment to give the Mushroom Kingdom monarch the celebration she so thoroughly deserved. Yet where Kirby received a Mario-worthy, Iliad-esque epic in Forgotten Land, this is more akin to a flimsy pop-up book. \u2022 Princess Peach: Showtime is out now; \u00a349.99", "date": "2024-03-22", "section": "Games", "author": "Tom Regan", "id": 304, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/30c9b56fd3bda1d50765da7dd5aa2fcda5ed2515/36_0_1800_1080/500.jpg"}, {"title": "The Guide #131: Are music biopics the new superhero films?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/22/the-guide-131-music-biopics-new-superhero-films", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.063, "neu": 0.718, "pos": 0.219, "compound": 0.9974}, "body": "This year\u2019s surprise hit at the box office has been Bob Marley: One Love. The biopic of the reggae icon has grossed over $170m and counting, meaning it\u2019s only behind Kung Fu Panda 4 and Dune: Part Two in 2024 receipts. Next month sees the release of Back to Black, an Amy Winehouse biopic that is expected to perform strongly on the back of a slew of free promo for its questionable likenesses and ghoulish portrayal of the ill-fated singer. Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, Grateful Dead, Billy Joel, Boy George, Maria Callas, Linda Ronstadt, Fred Astaire, Carole King, George Michael, Bee Gees, Keith Moon and the Beatles (times four, one for each member) \u2013 all have biopics about them due in the coming months. While Hollywood today is dominated by sequels, remakes and comic book extended universes, 2023 saw the decline of the superhero movie. While the summer slate is still headlined by a couple of comic book titles (notably Deadpool &amp; Wolverine and Joker 2) it does appear that audience demand has peaked and that the superhero movie is finally going \u201cthe way of the western\u201d as predicted by Steven Spielberg a decade ago. Forever in search of a new trend capable of buffeting their revenues, studios are increasingly looking towards music biopics to provide reliable income (theatrical chains expect this year\u2019s North American box office to be down 11% on 2023\u2019s strong performance). Although grounded in reality and often featuring mature themes (plenty of sex and drugs amid the rock\u2019n\u2019roll) music biopics ape superhero movies in that they come steeped in mythology, and with an eager audience of already devoted fans baked in, essentially allowing the studios to have their cake (compete for awards) and eat it (cash out). In essence, 20th-century pop culture represents an extended universe that studios and film-makers can mine for profit. It doesn\u2019t hurt that these films typically don\u2019t cost a bomb, with most of the budget going on music rights. Not that you necessarily need to shell out for the actual songs: Nowhere Boy, England is Mine, and Stardust show you can work around the lack of hits by focusing on the origin story. What\u2019s more these films have the potential for huge upside if they can find a large audience beyond fans. Prior to Oppenheimer, Bohemian Rhapsody ($910m) was the highest-grossing biopic of all time and Elvis, Rocketman and Straight Outta Compton all performed brilliantly relative to their $40m to $80m budgets. Music biopics also represent a way of keeping actor fees to a minimum \u2013 Austin Butler only got a reported $700,000 for portraying Elvis. Of course, the best ones feature a lead actor capable of embodying a legendarily charismatic star but the presence of a marquee \u201ccharacter\u201d to some extent ameliorates the need for a huge star. In this sense, biopics mirror superhero movies \u2013 they may be huge stars now but Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and Tom Holland were not exactly massive names prior to getting cast as marquee fictional characters. Perhaps having Elvis or Bob Marley\u2019s name on the poster means it doesn\u2019t matter if the person playing them is a relative no mark. While some of these films received criticism for being formulaic, hitting recurrent beats such as the artist suffering at the hands of sceptical parents or the band coming together for the first time, before inevitably falling out over the frontman\u2019s outsized share of the glory, they create opportunities for fan service (and parody as in the underrated biopic Weird: The Al Yankovic story). They also create space for more experimental cinema such as Todd Haynes\u2019 Bob Dylan biopic, I\u2019m Not There (with Cate Blanchett\u2019s performance representing a template for how a successful performance need not be a perfect imitation). And just like a superhero, music stars can be recast and reconfigured. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s take on Bob Dylan is just around the corner. With fan speculation already rife as to who Mendes will cast in his forthcoming Beatles tetralogy (with an individual film devoted to each of the Fab Four, creating a shared universe more commonly found in \u2026 superhero movies) it seems the music biopic will remain as a highly profitable Hollywood staple for a few years at least. But whether fans will truly have the appetite for four separate flicks will probably be a defining acid test as to whether they can deliver the sustained success that superhero movies have over the past few decades.

The community leader spearheaded a campaign to save Edgars Creek, a tributary that runs through the basalt plains linking Epping, Thomastown and Reservoir to Merri Creek in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs. \u201cSeventeen years ago, the Edgar\u2019s Creek corridor was a wasteland of noxious weeds,\u201d he says. \u201cYet hiding there was a beautiful watercourse flowing along a natural rocky course with pockets of remnant vegetation still surviving. I thought the place deserved better so I organised a meeting in the neighbourhood house to garner interest and a community group was formed.\u201d From an initial meeting, locals undertook thousands of hours of volunteer work using only indigenous plants grown from seeds collected from the catchment. Indigenous bushland and a wetland habitat was successfully reintroduced over the industrial wasteland, preventing the area from being sold to developers after a concerted community campaign. \u201cCare, vision and inclusion were key success factors, as was access to knowledge about how healthy ecosystems function at a local scale,\u201d he says. Aside from the deep satisfaction of restoring a natural environment, the project transformed the lives of those who participated, says Northey, especially during Covid lockdowns. \u201cPeople want to be custodians for their local environment. Friends groups can help facilitate and encourage that desire; that need. In fact, more than ever we need opportunities to connect with our planet and each other,\u201d he says. How to get involved in tree planting in your area Tree-planting initiatives are taking place all over Australia, but one of the largest is Plant Trees Australia, organised through Carbon Positive Australia, which provides a platform for volunteers to connect with community groups and offers resources on upcoming tree-planting projects. \u201cTree planting is essential to combat climate change and restore healthy ecosystems, so why would you not want to get on board,\u201d says Lauren Purcell, the communications and partnerships coordinator for Carbon Positive Australia. Her organisation surveys existing bushland to identify naturally occurring plant species to replant in selected areas of remnant bushlands. \u201cOur projects often include more than 50 native species and include shrubs, ground cover and other understory species that help support the natural ecosystem,\u201d she says. Given Australia currently ranks fourth worst in the world for land clearing and has among the worst species extinction rates globally, these projects provide a counterpoint to the mass land clearing taking place across Australia, she says. \u201cRehabilitating cleared and degraded land can be challenging, particularly as the climate continues to change,\u201d says Purcell. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that these projects use local seed collections to promote local species, connect remaining bush and forests, and monitor and maintain the new growth, especially during the initial stages.\u201d What to plant at home in urban Australian settings While community-based regeneration projects are vital for restoring degraded habitats, for an increasing number of people the desire to get our hands dirty and improve our local environment starts in our own back yard. Patrick Belford, urban horticulturist and director of Inner City Nature in Melbourne, says a good place to start at home is by replacing grass lawns and nature strips with living ecosystems that will make gardens more biodiverse, encourage insects and native birds, and reduce the need for polluting and noisy lawn mowing. \u201cSmall trees on the north and northern western aspects of a dwelling can create immediate microclimate changes. Deciduous trees and climbing plants on structures play a part in passively cooling and protecting a dwelling in summer and letting the sun warm it in winter,\u201d he says. Native trees will also support local birdlife and are able to adapt to harsh weather conditions, he says, recommending trees such as coral gum (Eucalyptus torquata), fuchsia gum (Eucalyptus forrestiana) or willow myrtle (Agonis flexuosa) for local Australian gardens. \u201cReplacing lawns with garden beds and plantings will reduce the need for mowing, and create habitat for pollinating insects that feed the entire food system,\u201d says Belford. What is \u2018rewilding\u2019 and how does it help? The urge towards nature immersion, tree planting and urban regeneration is not new, but as the climate crisis worsens it has taken on a new relevance and urgency. According to Claire Dunn, author of the book Rewilding the Urban Soul, the human rewilding movement seeks to actively counter the ill effects of urban over-domestication and alienation from nature by returning a quality of wildness and earth-centredness to the way we live and how we understand our place on the the planet. \u201cIn these times of despair and uncertainty, planting a tree is hope in action, the kind of hope that comes not from wishful thinking but by taking actions, maybe small, in support of change,\u201d she says. \u201cAnyone who has spent time with a tree old enough to be their great-great-grandmother will know its value beyond carbon. They\u2019re elders, and remind us of forest time, that is much much longer than the election cycles.

After the turbulent years of Diana and Sarah Ferguson, the royals were delighted when William became romantically involved with the nice, middle-class girl from the home counties when the pair were studying at St Andrews University. Since then, there has been a fairytale wedding, three healthy children, and a princess to be proud of: calm, cheerful and devoted to her job as wife and mother to the future king and his siblings. After her cancer diagnosis, made public on Friday, William, the children, her parents and her in-laws will be coming to terms with a serious health crisis and an uncertain future in the glare of global media coverage. No wonder she wanted privacy. Catherine and William met in 2001 when she took part in a charity student fashion show that the prince attended. The following year, they shared a student flat with two others. At this point they were just friends. That changed over the following months and years, and by the time they graduated in 2005 they were a couple. But in 2007, they took a few months out from their relationship. Catherine later said: \u201cI think I at the time wasn\u2019t very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person \u2026 You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn\u2019t realised \u2026 I really valued that time for me as well although I didn\u2019t think it at the time, looking back on it.\u201d The break didn\u2019t last. In March 2008, the couple were photographed on the ski slopes in Klosters, and in October 2010 William proposed while on a trip to Kenya. \u201cI just decided it was the right time really,\u201d he said later. \u201cWe\u2019d been talking about marriage or a while, so it wasn\u2019t a massively big surprise.\u201d Marriage was an enormous commitment, and not just to one another. For Catherine, it meant her life would be lived in the public eye, under constant scrutiny and immense pressure to deliver for the royal family. She knew how challenging it would be. William and Kate married on 29 April 2011 in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey that was broadcast around the world. Two years later, after a pregnancy blighted by severe morning sickness, she gave birth to her first son, George. Charlotte followed in 2015 and Louis in 2018. The Princess of Wales has issued frequent updates about her family life. During the Covid pandemic, she spoke in a BBC interview about the challenges of parenting through lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s been ups and downs, like a lot of families self-isolating,\u201d she said. On their 10th wedding anniversary, the couple posted a video of themselves and their children walking through sand dunes in Norfolk, thanking people for their well wishes. Other photos and messages were posted online at Christmas, Mother\u2019s Day and anniversaries. It has not been all smooth sailing. Catherine and the Duchess of Sussex were said to have a fractious relationship, perhaps contributing to the growing distance between William and Harry. She and her father-in-law \u2013 then Prince Charles, now the king \u2013 were named in the Dutch version of a book as the members of the royal family who had allegedly discussed how dark the skin of Harry and Meghan\u2019s unborn child might be. But public affection for the Princess of Wales has been remarkable. She has been widely praised for her sunny demeanour, charity work, fashion sense, parenting skills and informality. When it was announced in January that she had planned abdominal surgery, speculation about her health inevitably took off. The surgery had been successful, said Kensington Palace, and she would spend some weeks recovering at home. \u201cThe Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate,\u201d it said. \u201cShe hopes the public will understand \u2026 her wish that her personal medical information remains private.\u201d After weeks of hysterical speculation and wild conspiracy theories, that period of privacy has come to an end. It had been \u201can incredibly tough couple of months\u201d for her and her family, she said in her video statement released on Friday. No doubt, it will continue to be tough for some time to come, but public sympathy will be unbounded.", "date": "2024-03-22", "section": "UK news", "author": "Harriet Sherwood", "id": 307, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/17e4f9df731d14e97e27cb21756f156e0ae6bba9/0_151_4817_2890/500.jpg"}, {"title": "RollerCoaster Tycoon at 25: \u2018It\u2019s mind-blowing how it inspired me\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/mar/22/rollercoaster-tycoon-at-25-its-mind-blowing-how-it-inspired-me", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.07, "neu": 0.706, "pos": 0.224, "compound": 0.9993}, "body": "\u2018I remember I would rush home from school just to play RollerCoaster Tycoon,\u201d recalls John Burton, a senior creative lead at Merlin Entertainments (the owner of UK-based theme parks including Alton Towers, Chessington World of Adventures, and Legoland Windsor) and the man designing the forthcoming 236ft (72-metre) drop Hyperia rollercoaster at Thorpe Park. \u201cI would then go to sleep dreaming I could become the next Walt Disney.\u201d When he reflects on the game, the adult Burton speaks with the excitement of a teenager on a sugar high. \u201cI learned so much about how rollercoaster systems work with their block zones, or even the little tricks of the trade at theme parks like adding side queues and strategically placed toilets,\u201d he continues, confirming my suspicion that the Jumanji-themed jungle world he helped to design for Chessington has what he calls \u201csubconscious similarities\u201d to the classic PC game\u2019s Jolly Jungle scenario. \u201cIf I have to travel to a theme park abroad for work, I still load up the original game on the plane and sketch out ideas. I never really stopped playing.\u201d Released 25 years ago today, RollerCoaster Tycoon (the biggest selling PC game of 1999) achieved viral success before online virality was an established thing, inspiring countless geo-site forum communities where users could share designs and re-creations of their favourite real-life rides. These communities persist even today, with one designer recently creating a nightmarish existential rollercoaster that takes a sickening 12 years to complete. Selling 700,000 copies in its first year, the 1999 theme park strategy game RollerCoaster Tycoon helped keep its publisher Atari alive and kicking. Today is its 25th anniversary. RollerCoaster Tycoon didn\u2019t just give millions of fans an infinite toolbox of fun to build the theme parks of their candified dreams (more on this later), but helped to demystify the whole adjacent theme park industry, and make it less male dominated. \u201cFor years and years, I remember being the only woman working on rollercoaster projects,\u201d says Candy Holland, executive creative director at Legoland resorts and an industry stalwart who helped design the world\u2019s first vertical drop rollercoaster, Oblivion, at Alton Towers. \u201cBut when RollerCoaster Tycoon came out, we suddenly had a surge of young women applying for jobs. They were utilising RollerCoaster Tycoon to build their understanding of what, I guess, was previously seen as a pretty niche industry.\u201d One of those young women was Flora Lui, senior project manager for Merlin\u2019s \u201cmagic making\u201d team in California. Unlike so many of the games from its era (Resident Evil, GoldenEye 007), she argues that RollerCoaster Tycoon traded death and destruction fantasies for joyous creativity, and therefore attracted male and female players. \u201cPlaying RollerCoaster Tycoon was radical,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember I would change the colours so all my rides were pink. I\u2019d spend a lot of time making queues that were more like mazes, which hilariously confused the customers, and I would show my parents all the designs, too. As a project manager I must consider the push and pull of a budget; the effect of increased visitation; safety; managing guest flow, and delivering magic. Sometimes when I\u2019m in meetings, considering all these things, I remember how RollerCoaster Tycoon led me down this path.\u201d From the tranquil Leafy Lake to the more exhilarating Haunted Harbour and Diamond Heights, each of the game\u2019s 21 scenarios was about finding quick solutions to dilemmas and creating a theme park capable of giving pixelated punters the times of their lives. \u201cThe game\u2019s success really kept the Atari business going,\u201d admits Atari\u2019s CEO, Wade Rosen. \u201cI think the fact that you could build these really intricate rollercoasters, or completely ignore all of that and launch [customers] into a lake or see how many of them you could nauseate, was really the genius of it\u201d Everyone who played it had a \u201cdifferent experience\u201d, Rosen argues, and he says the canvas of creativity present in RollerCoaster Tycoon was practically a prototype for Minecraft later on. He was a ruthlessly capitalistic player, he says. \u201cI really liked the business aspects of it \u2026 When it was raining, I\u2019d quickly put up the prices on umbrellas. I\u2019d be like, now it\u2019s $20. And then you\u2019d bring in a bunch of cash.\u201d The game eventually sold well over 6m copies worldwide, becoming the launchpad for a successful franchise \u2013 despite the fact that, at the time, its 2D isometric graphics stood out like a sore thumb among the fast-improving 3D graphics that characterised 1999\u2019s big hitters. \u201cThe graphical style is now seen as whimsical and unique instead of outdated and restrictive, like it was back then,\u201d the game\u2019s Scottish creator, Chris Sawyer, says. \u201cAnd, perhaps because the focus was much less on graphical detail and immersiveness, it was possible to put more depth and detail into the actual gameplay. \u201cFrom an early age I\u2019ve always enjoyed building things with Lego, often trains or mechanical machines, but always with that freedom to do things your own way and to try things out to see what works. RollerCoaster Tycoon\u2019s roots possibly come from that \u2013 a desire to have something simulated on the computer where you could build your own designs from scratch and try things out, and generally just learn what works and what doesn\u2019t, and what\u2019s fun or not fun to ride.\u201d Having created the critically acclaimed but commercially lukewarm Transport Tycoon, Sawyer began researching RollerCoaster Tycoon around 1996. Ironically, he grew up terrified of rollercoasters after becoming convinced his cart on The Scenic wooden ride in Great Yarmouth would derail during a childhood visit. At first, he thought a theme park game might be \u201ctoo niche\u201d, but after finally falling in love with thrill-seeking rides as an adult, he knew he had landed on a special idea. He started touring the world\u2019s greatest theme parks and taking notes. \u201cPerhaps the game\u2019s enduring interest is down to it appealing to players\u2019 nurturing instincts \u2013 we all like to build or create something of our own and then look after it, improve it, make sure it looks good and works well and grows well, and that\u2019s the crux of this game,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other aspect of the game which perhaps stands out is that it still remains one of very few games which is almost completely positive \u2013 you\u2019re rewarded for good design and management rather than destroying things, and fundamentally the game is all about keeping your little guests happy.\u201d Huge sales aside, Sawyer said he knew RollerCoaster Tycoon had made an impact on the world when he visited a theme park in the US in the early 2000s. \u201cI remember seeing a whole series of food stalls in a small theme park which looked just like RollerCoaster Tycoon food stalls, with giant items of food or drink modelled on top \u2013 that felt quite eerie.\u201d When I tell about the real-life rollercoaster designers I spoke to for this feature, he seems a little surprised. \u201cI would feel quite proud if my games had actually steered some of them towards their careers,\u201d he replies. Yet while RollerCoaster Tycoon set Burton and Lui off on their career paths, they are both keen to highlight that the game doesn\u2019t get everything right about theme-park design. \u201cReal life rollercoasters aren\u2019t set in a grid; you can be way more flexible,\u201d says Burton. \u201cIn the game it costs \u00a350 to place a piece of track down. I wish it was \u00a350, as I could build the longest rollercoaster in the world. The reality is these are million-pound investments. The speed of the rollercoasters aren\u2019t possible in real life either \u2013 the G-forces would kill a real person.\u201d Lui, meanwhile, says that if she dared to recreate some of the zigzag queues she made in the game as a child, she\u2019d probably be sacked. \u201cThe greatest rides are the ones that tell a story,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reality is there are hundreds of people from different departments putting rollercoasters together.\u201d If you\u2019ve been on a real-life rollercoaster lately, maybe it was designed by a millennial who grew up playing RollerCoaster Tycoon. According to Rosen of Atari, the series will soon expand with a new 3D entry, but the game\u2019s original creator, Sawyer, says he has no interest remaking the original two games with next-gen graphics. Whatever the future holds for the series, Burton of Merlin is just happy it was RollerCoaster Tycoon he got drawn into in 1999, rather than the year\u2019s other paradigm-shifting game: Pok\u00e9mon on the Game Boy. \u201cThe game just gave you complete freedom; there were no rules,\u201d Burton says. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, because one of the things that helped me get a job at Merlin was recreating the Alton Towers Nemesis ride on RollerCoaster Tycoon and showing it at my interview. Now I am working on the new Nemesis Reborn rollercoaster. It\u2019s mind-blowing how a video game inspired me to become a real-life rollercoaster creator.\u201d", "date": "2024-03-22", "section": "Games", "author": "Thomas Hobbs", "id": 308, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e3caed33dbc302699799185278a80258cfe56c0f/0_32_1024_614/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018Organising is the best kind of antidepressant\u2019: Astra Taylor and Leah Hunt-Hendrix on solidarity", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/23/organising-is-the-best-kind-of-antidepressant-astra-taylor-and-leah-hunt-hendrix-on-solidarity", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.113, "neu": 0.649, "pos": 0.238, "compound": 0.9991}, "body": "Leah Hunt-Hendrix and Astra Taylor\u2019s new book, a galvanising examination of the history of solidarity and how we can use it today to shape a fair and sustainable future, was born out of friendship. But the pair are from distinctly different backgrounds. Taylor is a Canadian-born writer, film-maker, musician and activist (the pair prefer the term organiser, more of which later) who grew up in Athens, Georgia. Hunt-Hendrix is an activist, too, as well as a political theory scholar and granddaughter of a Texas oil billionaire. She grew up on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, spending summers in Dallas. The two women met at Occupy Wall Street in 2011. They first wrote together in 2015, creating a technology issue for the Nation magazine and, says Hunt-Hendrix, \u201cdecided we were great collaborators and that was something we wanted to keep doing\u201d. They started writing Solidarity during lockdown, but publication was delayed because their original publisher, Verso, was in dispute with its union, so they decided to switch in solidarity with Verso\u2019s workers. As they finally gear up for their book tour, they sit and talk \u2013 Taylor, who is visiting family in North Carolina; Hunt-Hendrix at home in New York, a little croaky from the interrupted nights of new motherhood \u2013 about what solidarity means to them and why beating polarisation is our only hope. How did you come to collaborate? Leah Hunt-Hendrix: I thought Astra was the coolest. The first time we talked one-to-one was when she was organising a telethon for the Rolling Jubilee Fund, which raised money to buy and cancel tens of millions of dollars of debt. I think she may have then invited me to a meeting for Strike Debt, which was an Occupy [Wall Street] spin-off. Astra Taylor: I respected Leah out of the gate for the way she engaged during Occupy. There were many factions and divisions in that messy but important movement, and I certainly took note of folks I felt were committed and serious about trying to build power over the longer haul. Occupy was a school as well as a protest. I was a kid who was always interested in social justice, and when Occupy erupted I was like: the movement might not be perfect, but it\u2019s calling attention to the crisis of democracy, to inequality. LHH: Occupy was an amazing experience. Solidarity was a very prominent term there, but when I went back to the Princeton library to see what had been written about it, there was so little, so I ended up writing about it for my PhD dissertation. I went on to build an organisation called Solidaire \u2013 a fund to help resource social movements. I was so inspired by Astra\u2019s work, having learned how the concept of solidarity came from a financial term in ancient Rome for mutually held debts. Rather than being a fluffy concept of \u201clet\u2019s all get along\u201d, it was about organising debtors. AT: When she told me about her dissertation and the etymology of solidarity, I remember having a kind of A-ha! moment. We had collaborated on enough stuff to know that we worked well together and that we would have an intellectual adventure doing [the book] \u2013 and we did. You talk about organising as key to solidarity, but what does organising mean to you? LHH: Organising is a practice of getting involved with other people, choosing a problem that you want to address, and working together to try to overcome that problem. Whether it\u2019s trying to cancel student debt, or my first experience with organising in college, when I joined a campaign to get a living wage for city employees. AT: It\u2019s useful to contrast organising with activism. I can be an activist by myself by raising awareness, tweeting a lot. LHH: Tweeting is not organising. AT: Organising pushes against the idea that we can do this on our own, and that we win just by protesting. It\u2019s not just about all showing up in the street one time and a big display of shared aspirations. You need to dig in for the long haul and coordinate with other people and build a power block. People don\u2019t have a lot of opportunities in our lives to organise precisely because there\u2019s been a centuries-long war on solidarity. We have to teach each other, begin where you are with a few friends and take those baby steps. There really is no alternative. You say friends, but in the book you describe movements such as Occupy as being much broader than that. AT: I think that that matters so much. We both want to be part of movements that are majoritarian, inclusive in the sense that there\u2019s all kinds of folks from different walks of life coming together. I\u2019d been on the left in New York City for a while but I didn\u2019t know everybody at Occupy. A lot of them were younger than me. I grabbed on to that opportunity, forming the Debt Collective, which is the union of debtors. Just as Leah was thinking hard about solidarity, I was thinking hard about democracy. There were so many claims within the movement that \u201cthis is what democracy looks like\u201d \u2013 from a chaotically run meeting to, I don\u2019t know, a drum circle. Astra, do your creative and organising worlds overlap much? AT: Rarely do they overlap in literal ways. Ages ago I roped my partner [the singer-songwriter Jeff Mangum] into playing music at Occupy, and also at the launch of the Rolling Jubilee, but we haven\u2019t done anything like that since. That said, my more artistic projects \u2013 as a film-maker, or playing music with Neutral Milk Hotel [with Mangum] \u2013 don\u2019t feel totally separate from my political work. Organising is absolutely a creative act; it\u2019s about seeing the world as malleable and changeable, almost as a kind of material you can mould and remake. Political work can be very serious and hard but it is also an opportunity for collaboration and the unexpected, for experimentation and play. Organising, not unlike art-making, fundamentally involves taking an imaginative leap and also taking risks. Making films and being in a band involve coordinating a bunch of people and doing something together you couldn\u2019t do alone. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that a critical mass of the Debt Collective founders were artists. What\u2019s it like, Leah, being a member of the Hunt family but also being involved in social movements? LHH: The Hunt family [which owns one of the largest private oil companies in the US] is a fascinating one and my grandfather is a storied man, but my mom Helen left Dallas and raised me in NYC, in the feminist movement, surrounded by grassroots activists. She was focused on organising women of wealth to support women\u2019s rights, so in many ways I followed in her footsteps when I began to organise among wealthy donors too, though I was more focused on economic inequality. I also benefited from the example of my aunt, Swanee Hunt [former US ambassador to Austria], who spent her career helping women play leadership roles in politics, and particularly in conflict zones. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be who I am today without the influence of Helen and Swanee Hunt. Do you ever feel you have to play down your background, at least at first? LHH: I don\u2019t always lead with it, but it\u2019s important to be honest so that people don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve hidden something from them. There can be a tendency for people with wealth who have progressive politics to want to hide their background, or feel shame about it. I think it\u2019s important for each of us to embrace our own stories because in doing so, we can more readily access the diverse resources that our backgrounds give us access to. And as you say in the book, solidarity is about diverse groups working together. AT: We\u2019re pushed into identity camps \u2013 that\u2019s the political terrain that we\u2019re operating on. There has been a long and very well-funded effort to sabotage solidarity using divide-and-conquer tactics. In the US, the recent indictment of 61 activists at \u201cCop City\u201d [a \u00a370m police training facility being built on one of the only green spaces in Atlanta] names solidarity as the dangerous ideology motivating these protesters. But solidarity is not equivalent to identity \u2013 it transcends your identity, or expands it. We\u2019re saying that we need to push beyond the boundaries of the self. Solidarity is connecting across difference, building new alliances between people and then transforming the status quo. LHH: We were really interested in the history of the term, especially as it became more prominent in the late 1800s. At a time when we\u2019re so polarised, that feels like an important history to draw on. We didn\u2019t have a weekend, we didn\u2019t have an eight-hour workday: all these basic things that we take for granted now and are being eroded were the result of the labour movement\u2019s vision of a more humane society. They\u2019re the product of organising. AT: The modern discourse of solidarity emerged from the incredible tumult and economic change of the Industrial Revolution. Religious patterns were changing. There was a sense of the old systems that held things together crumbling, and that\u2019s when this question of solidarity came to the fore, with organised labour saying: \u201cWe want to challenge our exploitation. Solidarity can propel political changes.\u201d This is really relevant in this age of hyperpartisanship, where it\u2019s \u201cmy party versus your party\u201d. We\u2019re asking again: what can hold us together in this time of incredible tumult? Writing this book, I was struck by how we\u2019re having a lot of the same debates right now. LHH: We propose a vision of the \u201csolidarity state\u201d, like how the welfare state was what came out of those 18th- and 19th-century conversations \u2013 what\u2019s the 21st-century version of this? We\u2019re thinking of it not as just an interpersonal phenomenon, but as something that can be built into the fabric of society. What if people feel too scared, apathetic or exhausted to get involved? LHH: That feeling of powerlessness is a huge factor in the crisis that we\u2019re in. When I went to one of Astra\u2019s Debt Collective Rolling Jubilee events, everyone came wearing a name tag with how much debt they were in, and the idea was to say: this is not something that you need to be ashamed of; it\u2019s not a personal moral failing. This is a systemic problem and we can change this if we work together. Organising is the best kind of antidepressant if you\u2019re feeling alone or isolated or powerless. Get involved in an organisation because it can feel so powerful. AT: When people talk about the problems of social media and misinformation, especially among liberals, there\u2019s a sense that what we need to do is fact check our way out of this. Our argument is that we need to organise people out of this. That\u2019s what labour unions do at their best \u2013 they\u2019re not just forums for demanding better treatment but, like Occupy was for us, they\u2019re places of political education. We say: your enemies are not immigrants or trans people or students. Your enemies are the folks who are benefiting from and perpetuating this system. I\u2019m a big fan of [the organiser and educator] Mariame Kaba and her wonderful phrase, \u201chope is a discipline\u201d. We\u2019re looking back at this history \u2013 from abolitionists to disability justice movements and workers \u2013 and seeing that people fought against incredible odds in conditions where they had no reason to be optimistic. Only by working together can we save ourselves and each other. \u2022 Solidarity: The Past, Present, and Future of a World-Changing Idea by Astra Taylor and Leah Hunt-Hendrix is published by Pantheon (\u00a324.25)", "date": "2024-03-23", "section": "Books", "author": "Amy Fleming", "id": 309, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a1f6ff5e08a25e3e0d6bf406fb5055c44b04823b/0_2219_3305_1983/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018When I was younger I was arrogant\u2019: Vampire Weekend\u2019s Ezra Koenig on fatherhood and growing up", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/23/ezra-koenig-vampire-weekend-interview", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.094, "neu": 0.682, "pos": 0.223, "compound": 0.9991}, "body": "On its surface, Only God Was Above Us, the fifth album from Vampire Weekend, has a darkly fatalist point of view. Over some of the band\u2019s loudest, grittiest production to date, frontman and songwriter Ezra Koenig sings of curses, missed connections and imagined wars, airing plangent anxieties about how this tumultuous era of history will be remembered. It plays a little like a knottier sequel to the band\u2019s anxious 2013 record Modern Vampires of the City \u2013 but Koenig himself hopes the album leaves listeners with some level of hope. \u201cI think fatalism taken to its extreme is optimism \u2013 some of the happiest people in the world have some element of surrender and acceptance,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s fatalism \u2013 the world is a chaotic place and isn\u2019t that terrible? And then there\u2019s optimism \u2013 the world is a chaotic place, and you gotta surf that wave.\u201d The line of thinking is typical Koenig: carefully equivocal and wryly flippant at the same time, delivered earnestly and thoughtfully. It\u2019s a tightrope walk that\u2019s spilled into Only God Was Above Us, which dips back into the genteel trappings of early Vampire Weekend records \u2013 richly orchestrated with lush, ambling upright bass, dizzying sax solos and cascading piano lines \u2013 but manages to sound vastly different to anything the band have done before. There\u2019s a tense, almost violent streak to this album. Koenig agrees that it is \u201caesthetically darker \u2013 tonally, it\u2019s the most aggressive record we\u2019ve made\u201d, but he doesn\u2019t necessarily see it as a heavier record than its predecessor, 2019\u2019s shaggy, maximalist Father of the Bride. \u201cI think if you swapped the album covers, people would hear them differently,\u201d he says. \u201cBut maybe you have to allow people to categorise the albums by some kind of binary.\u201d Koenig and I are meeting in February, a few days before the long-awaited new album is announced. Sitting in a central London photo studio, he looks barely any different from when he was promoting Father of the Bride. His style, though, has changed with his records\u2019 shifts in tone, ditching brightly coloured fleeces with socks and sandals in favour of a khaki sweater and sand-toned slacks \u2013 perhaps a byproduct of his imminent 40th birthday. Ageing certainly influenced the restless, if hopeful, spirit of Only God Was Above Us. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was maybe a little arrogant, waiting for life to show me what was so good about it \u2013 and then I was like: \u2018Oh right, every person has an ability to love life,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the type of idea that would make my eyes roll out of my head when I was a sullen teenager or in my late 20s, wrestling with the point of all this.\u201d It\u2019s a marked change from his band\u2019s early years, when they were praised for distilling big ideas about existence and mortality into catchy, richly produced pop songs. Emerging in the mid-00s as part of a wave of indie bands that included MGMT and Animal Collective, Vampire Weekend quickly ascended to festival headliner status, thanks in no small part to their prodigious songwriting ability and Koenig\u2019s own sense of ambition. \u201cWhen the band was starting, I was obsessed with getting [second album] Contra out in 2010 \u2013 I thought it was important that we released albums back to back \u2013 it was so rushed. There was a real feeling of: \u2018This is a rare opportunity,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cTo continue at that pace and with that level of agitation would send anybody to burnout. And then you get into these existential things: if all you\u2019re doing is making music, what\u2019s the music about?\u201d In the five years since Father of the Bride, Koenig let life take centre stage. In 2018, he and his wife, the actor Rashida Jones, had a baby; after touring the album, he spent time living in Tokyo and London, in addition to their home base of Los Angeles, while she worked on film projects, grateful to let his life contract a little after the circus of promoting a record. He wrote and recorded parts of Only God Was Above Us in those cities, but it was hardly a case of choosing flashy recording destinations. \u201cLiving in these different places superficially gives the record a glamorous touch, but when you\u2019re moving abroad with your family, and your wife is working 14 hours a day, and your kid is in school, there\u2019s also a lot of solitude,\u201d he says. The relative mundanity of this time, he says, \u201callowed ideas to just creep in\u201d with little external pressure. \u201cI like doing normal stuff \u2013 I like taking long walks and being alone and reading. I like taking my son to school in the morning and talking about what we see during the drive. I like that being my primary mode.\u201d Only God Was Above Us is the first record Koenig has written since having a child. Has fatherhood changed his outlook on songwriting, or his career? \u201cThe short answer is no,\u201d he says, smiling sheepishly. The album\u2019s sense of optimism, however, does derive in part from some sense of responsibility he feels towards a younger generation. \u201cThe future is totally out of their control,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you hear people talk about whatever aspect of the world is their current fixation \u2013 like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this exists when my child is gonna be growing up\u2019 \u2013 and then you realise, well, what can you give a child other than a way of embracing life?\u201d Such an idea is a necessity in the US right now, when partisan politics are at their most fractious. Koenig was a staunch Bernie Sanders supporter during both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns, and played at a handful of the senator\u2019s rallies. By the time 2020 rolled around, \u201cit felt a little bit like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know how likely it is that this is gonna happen, but it feels like the right thing to do at this moment,\u2019\u201d he recalls. Does he think any of Sanders\u2019s trademark policies, such as universal healthcare, might be revived during this year\u2019s election cycle? \u201cThere\u2019s always hope, because I think a lot of that stuff would be great. Rationally, are any of those things around the corner? I just don\u2019t know.\u201d The calmness with which he speaks about politics is reflected on Hope, the album\u2019s final track, on which he runs through a laundry list of political conspiracies and defeats, before landing on a note of bittersweet acceptance: \u201cOur enemy\u2019s invincible / I hope you let it go.\u201d He sees this, too, as a moment of optimism. \u201cPolitics is obsessed with outcome, and we\u2019re all surrounded by the anger and frustration of people who deeply believe that things need to go one way or another,\u201d he says. Hope, the song, is an appeal to see hope as \u201ca personal feeling, rather than a demand on the outside world\u201d, an idea he\u2019s come to as he\u2019s grown older. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be millions of people disappointed at any given moment, maybe billions globally. If you hope for something specific, you will often be disappointed, but hope as a feeling, or a concept, [is] somehow bigger than outcome.\u201d In the same way that Only God Was Above Us returns to the baroque, distorted sound they explored on Modern Vampires, it also sees Koenig reuniting with his bandmates Chris Baio and Chris Tomson, who toured with the band circa Father of the Bride but didn\u2019t play on the record, and were not pictured in press photos. Multi-instrumentalist Rostam Batmanglij, who left the band after Modern Vampires, also worked on the new album\u2019s production, as he did on Father of the Bride, although he is still not \u201cin\u201d the band. Koenig says there wasn\u2019t a conscious decision to bring Tomson and Baio back into the fold; Vampire Weekend has long been a recording project, and Father of the Bride was made with \u201cthem having some confidence in me to take us somewhere interesting, and me having confidence that they\u2019d be down to kind of wait and still be a part of it.\u201d A few years down the line, Koenig says he doesn\u2019t know if presenting Father of the Bride as a solo project was a good idea or not, although ultimately \u201cthe record was a success, we were very happy with the reception, it was our best and biggest tour\u201d. He still feels his motivations for the decision were sound. \u201cI just had a feeling that going into the fourth album, seeing a picture of three guys in their mid-30s was kind of like: \u2018This is gonna look like damaged goods.\u2019\u201d Part of it may have been that he was still \u201ctraumatised by the haters of our early days\u201d, he admits, referring to the coterie of music critics who ripped into the band for their perceived white, upper-class perspective \u2013 despite the fact that Koenig and Batmanglij, the band\u2019s songwriters, were working-class Jewish and Iranian, respectively. Presenting Father of the Bride as a solo project came out of a protective instinct. \u201cI had a feeling that it was going to be the most difficult transition, because some type of indie era was over, we lost a member, and our last album was our most serious, critically acclaimed album ever. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d Koenig is right in thinking that the scene Vampire Weekend came out of no longer exists in the same way; major mechanisms for breaking a band, such as indie blogs, no longer exist, and few rock artists are making it to the top of the Billboard charts. On a personal level, he no longer feels tapped into modern indie music, and says that anyway the press no longer seems intent on asking older bands to provide a seal of approval for rising prospects \u2013 as when Vanity Fair asked Paul Simon for his opinion on them back in 2011. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the [young] Vampire Weekend is now, and I don\u2019t know if anybody knows,\u201d Koenig says. \u201cWhen Contra came out, I knew the context it was made in; when this album comes out, I only know it in terms of Vampire Weekend\u2019s career.\u201d That seems to be as liberating for Koenig as it is unnerving; in Only God Was Above Us it results in a sound that\u2019s richer and more expansive than anything the band have made before, even as it returns to a style they mined deeply on Modern Vampires. \u201cThat context is another thing to contend with,\u201d he says. \u201cBut ultimately, I surrender to Father Time.\u201d Only God Was Above Us is released 5 April.", "date": "2024-03-23", "section": "Music", "author": "Shaad D'Souza", "id": 310, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/79b1ffa88b4d2c3753022e674e85d8936119f0cd/1205_1080_3122_1873/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Carrie Brownstein on aliens, sandwiches and bad outfits: \u2018Big hats are my most recurring fashion crime\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/24/carrie-brownstein-sleater-kinney-australia-new-zealand-tour-interview", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.144, "neu": 0.654, "pos": 0.203, "compound": 0.9693}, "body": "If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it? Peanut butter, banana and honey and a little bit of cinnamon. That is a pretty dessert-like sandwich but literally, before we started speaking, I ate one. Often when I\u2019m working or traveling, I\u2019ll eat at least one peanut butter sandwich a day. It is good protein! Do you have a favourite guitar? I have a walnut brown 1972 Gibson SG that I bought in Tacoma, Washington around 2000. Before that I\u2019d only ever played an Epiphone copy of an SG, and then moved on to Rickenbackers, but I wanted an actual Gibson SG from the 1970s. This is a little bit nerdy, but there\u2019s this dubious era of Gibson called the Norlin era, where supposedly the guitars made during this era were less consistent and reliable sonically than previous or later eras. Mine happens to be a Norlin but it has a great sound. I like that it has a thin neck as I don\u2019t have giant hands. I love it. It\u2019s the guitar I return to. I recorded a lot of Little Rope on it. What\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever received? Wait things out. There can be things that you really worry about in the moment that feel dire and irreversible \u2013 then you wait six months and it just doesn\u2019t matter any more. You get swept up in a moment of anger, jealousy or disorientation but if you stick things out long enough, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve previously called Australia the spiritual home of Sleater-Kinney. What is the most Australian thing you\u2019ve ever done? Probably date an Australian? That sounds crude \u2013 it sounds like I\u2019m saying I literally did an Australian, which I guess I did. But I\u2019m very much immersed in Aussie culture. What has been your biggest fashion crime to date? I am guilty of what I call \u201ca tour outfit\u201d. I go somewhere like Mexico or Marfa, Texas and I\u2019ll think, \u201cOh, this giant cowboy hat looks great on me!\u201d And I will wear it throughout the entire trip. In every photo, I am wearing this accoutrement. And then I get home and I am horrified. It\u2019s almost like a horror movie, where I go into my closet and I see this hat and it\u2019s like some stranger has put it there. What is this god-awful item of clothing? Suddenly it looks terrible, it looks farcical and inauthentic. And then I have to get rid of it. So big hats are my most recurring fashion crime. What do you do when you can\u2019t get to sleep? I listen to podcasts or audiobooks, but it has to be a mellifluous, comforting voice. I really like Jon Ronson. He has a great voice. I find it very soothing. There\u2019s no hard edges to it. It is sort of reedy, almost pretty. Do you believe in extraterrestrial life? I want to. I think it\u2019s fairly solipsistic to assume that humans are the only species that are able to build a society. Maybe in some far off part of the galaxy, there\u2019s some other species doing what we\u2019re doing. For all I know, we\u2019re living in a simulation of something that they have created \u2026 It almost would feel reassuring about not being the only thing out there. Do you have a party trick? I can juggle for a respectable amount of time \u2013 enough for somebody to be temporarily impressed. But it has to be a spherical item. I am not juggling knives or fire. Which movie scarred you as a kid? The Shining. I saw it a little too young. It\u2019s so scary. When I was a kid, I was watching horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street \u2013 films that were more fantastical and unbelievable. And then I saw The Shining and I just thought \u201cNo, there is true horror out there.\u201d And it comes from isolation and having a writing deadline. When was the last time you lied? I often cancel plans with an excuse that may not be factual. It\u2019s never to hang out with someone else \u2013 I just don\u2019t want to go out. It\u2019s actually something that I want to be more honest about because every time I do it, I think, \u201cWhy not just say that I really need some alone time tonight?\u201d But for some reason I always come up with some alternate fact like, I have a sore throat or I had to work late. I should just say \u2013 I think in this day and age, everyone understands.\ufeff Sleater-Kinney is touring Australia and New Zealand in May: Auckland on 15 May, Brisbane on 17 May, Melbourne on 19 May, Sydney on 21 May and Fremantle on 23 May.", "date": "2024-03-23", "section": "Music", "author": "Sian Cain", "id": 311, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5904e50adff69a6a8ffad6983b3ce90cd91e1e1f/0_53_5573_3344/500.jpg"}, {"title": "My 80-year-old mother lives an avant-garde life | Rhik Samadder", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/24/rhik-samadder-my-80-year-old-mother-lives-an-avant-garde-life", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.084, "neu": 0.701, "pos": 0.215, "compound": 0.9973}, "body": "Lately when I visit my mother, she\u2019s always out. \u201cAt rehearsal!\u201d she\u2019ll text. \u201cCome back after 5pm. Or another day.\u201d She\u2019s fallen in with a community choir, and is off the rails. Often they take her to the pub, and she doesn\u2019t know when she\u2019ll be back. Sometimes she leaves out a plate of falafel, in case I drop by to empty the fridge, like a reverse Santa Claus. But it\u2019s unacceptable. And often dry. At 80, she\u2019s started going to Laban dance classes. She still plays in a drum circle, and now this, singing in an urban opera. For her, art is a reflex. She does things for their own joy, while still holding down a job. I\u2019m the opposite. I made writing and performing my job; yet something in a creative identity can squash itself. Without the stamp of an agent, an audience, a platform or a deal, nothing I make would feel valid. I never wrote a word until I was paid, and I dream of retirement. She\u2019s more avant garde than me, in every way. I remember happier days, when she\u2019d meet me at the door with something hot from the kitchen. \u201cSpinach soldiers on speedboats\u201d for example: vegetable croquettes standing to attention on half a baguette, with omelette netting. She\u2019d make daal with chewy mango from snack packs. She had been working on a perfectly spherical meal. It involved stuffing a portobello mushroom with lingonberries, placing it within a bisected English muffin, and re-sealing it. She was this close to creating a Euclidean turducken, but moved on. Where she expands, I contract. When my life as an actor entered a fallow period, I worried about being demoted to a hobbyist. What makes a real actor? Is it a measure of how often they get to do it, how good they are, whether they\u2019re being paid? Is going to drama school like having tenure, a lifetime ratification? Actors are insecure, because they need permission to practise their art. It\u2019s not so much a profession as an existential crisis in tights. Determined to kidnap my mother, as well as find out what an urban opera actually is, I turned up to one of her performances. Our Street, it\u2019s called, devised by the Lewisham Creative Chorus \u2013 a group more diverse in terms of age, ethnicity and background than any West End production could dream of. These things make a difference. \u201cSalus populi suprema lex esto\u201d began the show \u2013 an unsettling whisper from performers placed in the crowd. The wellbeing of the people is the highest law. Whispers became a chant, then morphed into one of the catchiest, most rousing songs I\u2019ve ever heard. There were heart-stopping soloists, puppetry, poetry, snatches of Schubert. When my mother appeared centre stage, cradling a mannequin of a boy, clearly deeply moved, I burst into tears. I\u2019d expected this to be sweet, but I hadn\u2019t expected it to actually be good. I\u2019d envisioned amateur dramatics. Visions of retirees stumbling through The Importance of Being Earnest in a town hall, making nonsense of the lines amid a collapsing set. Where does that snobbery about amateur dramatics come from? If you are a creative and a child of Thatcher, you hang on to hierarchies that no one else cares about. It\u2019s the only way to shore up a precarious self-image, with a cripplingly internalised worldview that says art is worthless unless it has economic value. But we\u2019re past that now. The sinking financial tide of these past decades has exposed the supporting beams involved in becoming a professional creative. Does anyone look at these \u201cThirty Under 30\u201d lists, without realising most of them, without denying the obvious talent, could be re-titled \u201cHow Deep Is Your Safety Net\u201d? Most popular culture, especially for the young, is generated by what we once called amateurs. TikTok comedians, whose skits go viral. Soundcloud rappers and musicians who find critical acclaim. Bedroom-based makeup tutorials posted on YouTube shape how we look. Recipes from home chefs become staples, we buy art from artists who never went to art school, follow singers whose only qualification is being really good at singing. Social media may be bad for our health, but it is good at bypassing gatekeepers. We need this bursting dam of talent more than ever. The rise of amateur orchestras, community choirs and dance groups arguably doesn\u2019t need to be celebrated. It is the celebration. I do think there\u2019s something different happening than with TV shows like Britain\u2019s Got Talent or The X Factor, where the big prize is still, ultimately, fame. There\u2019s something about performers who do it for connection and community that breaks me open with joy. They put real life on the stage, more viscerally than professionals can. But art is not a competition, any more than it is a distraction, or a luxury for a privileged few. It\u2019s our humanity, and it\u2019s how we keep going. It\u2019s why we keep going. Inspired, I resolve to unstitch my paralysis. My renaissance mother is not an artist because she trained, or gets gigs. She decided she is one, and lives accordingly. So I sit and write a short scene, for no one other than myself. It feels good. It feels alive. I guess I am my mother\u2019s child after all. And now I\u2019m hungry. Lewisham Creative Chorus are raising money to put on a full version of their urban opera. You can support them here. (I\u2019d be grateful, as I\u2019m hoping my mother moves on from this and gets back to my dinners. For Mother\u2019s Day she gave me pigs in blankets.)

Financial data gathered for a new national lobbying group called Culture Makes \u2026, started by the Cultural Philanthropy Foundation (CPF), revealed the severe plight of even theatres, galleries and museums that receive regular state grants. The success of these national gems is usually considered a matter of pride. But end-of-year accounts recently submitted by the 100 organisations that get the most annual funding from Arts Council England show 73 have reported a loss, and this averages at about \u00a3300,000. Among them is the Royal Shakespeare Company, which has dipped into the red by a few thousand pounds, despite some stringent budgeting. While not all of these leading venues and cultural attractions are actually in debt, several are. And even though commercial profitability is not always the bottom line \u2013 since levels of subsidy will always be required \u2013 many have fallen well short of attempts to break even. \u201cIt was very striking how hard it is for even these top institutions, known as the arts council\u2019s National Portfolio organisations, especially as they are already pulling all the available financial levers,\u201d said Caroline McCormick, who chairs the CPF and is organiser of the lobbying drive, which will launch in May with the aim of influencing policy before the next general election. \u201cIt is now all so close to the bone.\u201d McCormick plans to call for protection for British culture by demonstrating its importance, opposing the notion that it is an optional extra, and something to aim for only in better days. \u201cThere is no trickle-down effect for the arts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe now know that is a myth. And there are not enough wealthy people making donations, so we cannot rely on arts philanthropy.\u201d The campaign has already won the support of almost 40 cultural bodies and providers, including the RSC, Edinburgh international festival, Bristol Old Vic, the Women\u2019s Prize Trust, Hastings Contemporary, Theatre Clwyd, Lyric Theatre Belfast, Northern Ballet, Southbank Centre, Picturehouse Cinemas, Talawa Theatre Company, National Museums Liverpool and Shakespeare\u2019s Globe. \u201cThe arts and culture have immense power to transform the lives of all who encounter it,\u201d the RSC\u2019s joint interim executive directors, Sandeep Mahal and Vicky Cheetham told the Observer, adding that at a time of economic uncertainty and funding cuts that were already challenging the wellbeing of people and communities around the country, their company is proud to be joining Culture Makes \u2026. \u201cThis campaign will help to build our collective understanding of the economic, creative, social and physical power that exists within the culture sector in the UK and support the case for growing critical public and private funds to ensure we have a thriving arts and culture sector that is a beacon to the world,\u201d they said. The wider arts crisis caused by the cost of living increase, in addition to a real-terms reduction of state funding and the complete loss of some local council grants, is already threatening the existence of smaller provincial organisations. But the effect on grander institutions has also become clear, in spite of what most acknowledge is the high value of a thriving British creative sector. Sydney Thornbury, chief executive of the contemporary gallery the Art House in Wakefield, said she signed up to the campaign because she had seen art create social benefits and build community. \u201cWe bring together asylum seekers, refugees and the local community to create art together, but this also creates relationships and community cohesion, and develops new skills and abilities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have re-animated nearly dead shopping centres, helped grow small creative businesses into renting their own shops, and helped to activate networks of local entrepreneurs \u2013 all while also helping to curb antisocial behaviour, raise local civic pride, and make some great art. But are we thriving financially? No. We\u2019re barely hanging on \u2013 like everyone else in the arts sector at the moment \u2013 because we are seen and funded as \u2018just\u2019 arts organisations.\u201d McCormick, who is also the director of Achates, an arts fundraising consultancy, pointed out that a report into charitable giving last year showed that arts philanthropy had declined to less than 1% of total donations for the first time in more than a decade. And the truth, she said, was that the poorest in society were giving proportionally much more than the rich.

It actually works the other way round. It\u2019s the most basic thing that we need to build things upon. But the arts sector has to find a new language to communicate this.

The leadership became vacant after the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, announced his surprise resignation \u201cfor personal and political reasons\u201d last week. Harris, 37, the higher education minister, was the only candidate when nominations closed at 1pm on Sunday, but he will not become taoiseach until 9 April when the Irish parliament, the D\u00e1il, resumes after its Easter break. He outlined his leadership priorities on Sunday at a selection convention in Athlone, County Westmeath, to choose party candidates for the European parliament elections in June. Harris said he wanted the centre-right Fine Gael \u2013 which governs with fellow conservatives Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green party \u2013 to revert to core values including making work pay, being tough on law and order and supporting farmers. \u201cFine Gael stands for supporting businesses, especially small businesses the length and breadth of this country. Fine Gael stands for making work pay, for making sure we value work and we value people who go to work.\u201d To cheers from the audience he added: \u201cFine Gael stands for law and order.\u201d He also told delegates \u201cit was the absolute honour of my life\u201d to be elected leader. He concluded, to a standing ovation, with: \u201cI\u2019m up for it. Are you?\u201d Heather Humphreys, the social protection minister, who is from a rural border constituency, is expected to be named as deputy leader of the party. Harris has given no indication as to possible changes in Fine Gael ministerial ranks. But there is speculation that ministers who do not intend to stand at the next election will be dropped. It is widely believed that Simon Coveney will be a casualty in the reshuffle. Varadkar resigned after taking responsibility for the government\u2019s failure in the recent referendums to update references to women and the family in the constitution. Harris is widely seen as a good communicator, particularly on social media. He has held a number of ministerial portfolios including health at the start of the Covid pandemic. Although widely praised for his handling of the crisis, he had to apologise for what he called an \u201cawful boo-boo\u201d after incorrectly saying in a radio interview there were 18 other coronaviruses before Covid-19. Until Varadkar\u2019s resignation it had been assumed that Ireland\u2019s next general election would be in October after a giveaway budget in September but the leaders of Fianna F\u00e1il and the Greens say they believe the government should see out the remaining 12 months of its term. Both Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il are trailing Sinn F\u00e9in, the leftwing nationalist party and Ireland\u2019s main opposition, in the polls but the political situation is very fluid. Sinn F\u00e9in, once the political wing of the IRA, is the largest party in the Northern Ireland assembly. A poll in the Sunday Business Post shows support for all three parties has fallen after the referendums, in which all three urged a yes vote to the proposed changes.

Fewer than one in 10 investors were exploring new investments in nuclear technology in the survey of the Investor Group on Climate Change, whose 100 members include super funds and asset managers looking after the funds of 15 million Australians. The survey found a rebound in confidence in Australia\u2019s climate policy but a growing appetite for clear timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The opposition, led by Peter Dutton, plans to propose locating nuclear power plants on the site of retiring coal power plants, claiming that this would save having to build new transmission infrastructure for renewables. But the plan has been widely panned. The energy department has estimated it would cost $387bn to go nuclear, and Dutton faces opposition from his own state colleagues. Australia\u2019s big private electricity generators have dismissed nuclear energy as a viable source of power for their customers for at least another decade, and likely more. In the yearly survey by the Investor Group on Climate Change investors were asked which energy and climate solutions they believed had good long-term returns. Nuclear energy was ranked last of 14 possible responses, along with sustainable oceans. \u201cThis is due to nuclear energy\u2019s very high cost, and the lack of maturity and deployment in next generation technologies,\u201d a policy brief on the survey said, citing the CSIRO\u2019s gencost report. The five most popular options were: renewable energy (backed by 47% of respondents); nature solutions, including biodiversity or nature capital (34%); energy storage (32%); low carbon transport (32%); and industry/materials, including critical minerals (32%). In 2021 about 70% of investors cited policy and regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to investing in climate solutions, a figure that dropped to 40% in the 2023 data released on Monday. Asked to nominate the policies they wanted the government to prioritise, most investors (56%) called for sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans to keep global heating under the 1.5C threshold. There was also majority support for improved carbon pricing through the safeguard mechanism (54%), funding support for new technology (53%), and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (51%). The policy brief said \u201cemerging priorities\u201d included mandatory climate-related disclosures, timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, and clear policies to build resilience and adapt to the physical damages of climate change. Erwin Jackson, Investor Group on Climate Change\u2019s managing director of policy, said: \u201cInvestors have given the government a pretty good report card. \u201cThey\u2019re also sending the message that credible, investible and durable policy frameworks put in place today will support strong investor and beneficiary returns into the future, enhance Australia\u2019s economic competitiveness, and help attract international capital. \u201cWe must have a fair and fast transition to net zero emissions, but we must also adapt. \u201cInvestors look forward to working with governments on initiatives that can incentivise and remove barriers for private sector investment in adaptation across the economy.\u201d In the 2023 budget the Albanese government gave $2bn to help establish Australia\u2019s hydrogen industry and a further $1bn for households.

It was so bad I thought I needed stitches and I didn\u2019t have a first-aid kit easily accessible, so I called my youngest brother, who was working as a junior doctor at a nearby hospital. He came over with what he called the Rolls-Royce of Band-Aids, applied one carefully to my finger and asked me if I\u2019d help him choose a skirt to wear to a party that night. Helping him pick outfits is one of my favourite activities. At his request, I put on Dua Lipa (the party was in her honour) while he modelled the different options with a twirl and a hip pop. We picked one, decided on shoes and that he\u2019d wear his shirt tucked in. As he went to leave I had to catch myself from asking if he was going to put trousers on for the bike ride to the party. He is six years younger than me, but in that moment I was surprised at my own instinct for conservatism and grateful that in the years between us, gender norms have softened so much that he could leave the house in a skirt without thinking twice. Of course, it helps that he\u2019s handsome and he was riding his bike across Melbourne\u2019s inner north, but the experience \u2013 from his expertise as a \u201cgrown-up\u201d medical professional to his assuredness in his own feminine-masculinity \u2013 left me full of pride at the person he is. And thankful that (in some ways) we live in an increasingly open-minded society. Here, four men describe their adventures in skirts. \u2018I\u2019ve learned to impress myself the most\u2019 Louis Nuccitelli\u2019s experiments with skirts have come about in the last year. The designer and retail partnerships lead for Uber first wore a skirt when he dressed up as a Playboy bunny for a friend\u2019s birthday in January. More recently, he wore a red tartan miniskirt with a silver buckle clasp for his 30th birthday. The party theme was Louis\u2019 House Of Versailles. \u201cPicture the creative alchemy of a love child between Vivienne Westwood and Rick Owens as you enter,\u201d he says. Nuccitelli, who played at being a fashion designer when he was as young as eight, channelled the theme into his outfit with precise attention to detail. He styled the skirt with a structured white corset that sat just below his chest. He wore a heart-buckled belt around his waist and a bolero-style gold and black striped shirt with a ruffled collar. The look was finished with tall, bowed socks and a pair of black leather boots. \u201cI felt hot as fuck,\u201d he says. \u201cI went through some ghastly years of dressing to impress other people. In navigating this sphere, I\u2019ve learned to impress myself the most with the way I dress.\u201d \u2018I used to skateboard in them\u2019 The first time the director of Oig\u00e5ll Projects, Andy Kelly, wore a skirt in public it was a kilt and he was a partner at a debutante ball. \u201cIt was for the New Caledonian Society,\u201d he says. \u201cHow waspy is that?\u201d A few years later, at the age of 17, he started wearing \u201cugly chic\u201d floral skirts he found at op-shops in Sydney\u2019s Paddington. \u201cI used to skateboard in them and think I was a revolution,\u201d he says. He would team the knee-length, pleated or ruffled skirts with Harley-Davidson T-shirts or checked shirts and a fedora. Kelly, who is also the designer for Brud Studia and more than 180cm tall, doesn\u2019t shy away from attention. \u201cI think being a gay man, there is a lot of pressure to be hyper-masculine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was actually more subversive in that community to be a big guy who is quite masculine wearing garments like skirts.\u201d Over time, as his taste evolved, he started reaching for more expensive skirts by designers such as Givenchy and Kenzo. \u201cI haven\u2019t grown out of it. I am in a very pleated Thom Browne preppy skirt era currently,\u201d he says. \u201cWear a skirt, be your own hero.\u201d \u2018They relished dressing me\u2019 \u201cI grew up in a household that encouraged and loved all sides of us,\u201d says Liam Sharma. \u201cWearing a dress only felt weird once I started registering constructs in my first years of school.\u201d Sharma, a writer who also works for a beauty brand, loved to wear his sisters\u2019 hand-me-down pastel satin floor-length skirts. He\u2019d style them with a matching handbag (also designed by his sister) and prance around in the outfit before bed. \u201cI was a wobbly kid and stubbed my toes too much,\u201d he says. \u201cI left dried blood on a lot of floor-length gowns \u2026 I thought it was a mark of love and my sisters thought it was disgusting. But they relished dressing me.\u201d For Sharma, wearing a skirt represents a kind of freedom. \u201cNo one placed too much emphasis on what I could or couldn\u2019t wear. I was left alone to play in fabric and pull and pick pieces I thought I might love.\u201d \u2018After a glass of wine (or two) I was elated\u2019 Hamish was going out to lunch with a friend for her birthday when he wore his first skirt. \u201cIt was a three-quarter-length black Yohji Yamamoto skirt made from soft canvas,\u201d he says. \u201cThe silhouette was relaxed with some extra material, which created soft folds so it tapered.\u201d He found the confidence to wear it from some new friendships that had a playful, sisterly dynamic. \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t know me well, I had an opportunity to emphasise different parts of my personality,\u201d he says. \u201cI could talk and act in ways that might have been unlike my usual conduct, so I felt like I could wear different things without the risk being balked at by my usual group of friends. \u201c[I was] a touch insecure when leaving the house but after a glass of wine (or two) I was elated.\u201d Hamish styled the skirt with a white lightweight long shirt over a singlet. \u201cIt was typically a shirt I wore to the beach, so it was soft from all the washes and the colour had faded into a shade of sun lotion,\u201d he says. \u201cThe length of the shirt made it less obvious I was wearing a skirt, but they combined into a very comforting and summery flowing outfit.\u201d", "date": "2024-03-25", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Lucianne Tonti", "id": 320, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4a22e78069ca36d1c325ca2c6816b240085c20c5/718_369_6903_4143/500.jpg"}, {"title": "The next Clarence Thomas?

Turns out, they didn\u2019t even need to change the home address for his replacement. Ho\u2019s wife, Allyson, moved into her husband\u2019s position and his old office. Meet the Hos. Few people outside of legal circles have heard of the Hos, yet the couple is tied to the case before the US supreme court that will determine women\u2019s access to mifepristone, a drug commonly used in medication abortions. The court hears arguments in the case on Tuesday. Ho served on the three-judge panel last summer that ruled to restrict access to mifepristone. The legal group behind the mifepristone case, Alliance Defending Freedom, made at least six payments from 2018 through 2022 to his wife, Allyson, a powerhouse federal appellate lawyer who has argued in front of the supreme court and has deep connections to the conservative legal movement that has led the attack on the right to abortion in the US. The payments don\u2019t violate the court\u2019s code of conduct, according to Stephen Gillers, a New York University emeritus professor of law and author of Regulation of Lawyers: Problems of Law and Ethics. But some court watchers argue that Ho\u2019s failure to recuse himself from the case illustrates why public trust in the judiciary is eroding. One recent survey found that 63% of judges noted a dip in the public\u2019s positive perception of them. \u201cWhen Americans see a case like this \u2013 so clearly concocted and motivated by special interests, and with evident connections between those interests and the judges on the case, it does tremendous damage to the reputation of the courts, and to the public trust in their ability to give all litigants an even shake,\u201d said Alex Aronson, the executive director of the non-partisan group Court Accountability and a former chief counsel to the Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse. In an email to the Guardian, James Ho wrote that he \u201cconsulted our court\u2019s ethics advisor prior to sitting in that case, and was advised that there was no basis for recusal. In any event, my wife\u2019s practice is to donate honoraria to charity.\u201d The Hos are just one of the increasing number of power couples in the conservative movement in which the wife of a prominent official works in the background, laying the groundwork for Republican policies that their spouses will rule upon or legislate. In the mifepristone case, the wife of the Missouri senator Josh Hawley, Erin, is the attorney of record for Alliance Defending Freedom and argued the case before Ho. The supreme court justice Clarence Thomas rankled the legal world when he refused to recuse himself from a case involving questions about the January 6 insurrection and the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d campaign to which his wife, Ginni Thomas, was closely tied. For Aronson, these are examples of \u201cserious concerns about what is becoming an apparent pattern of coordinated activity by some of these couples in this extremist movement, including the Thomases, Hawleys and Hos\u201d. Ho\u2019s rulings have included zealous language, referencing what he called in one decision \u201cthe moral tragedy of abortion\u201d. He has suggested that protection orders in domestic violence cases \u201care too often misused as a tactical device in divorce proceedings \u2013 and issued without any actual threat of danger\u201d. Orin Kerr, a University of California, Berkeley, law professor, tweeted that one of Ho\u2019s opinions \u201creads like a politician\u2019s op-ed, not a legal opinion; judges should stick to law\u201d. In the mifepristone case, in which Ho supported rolling back decisions made by the Food and Drug Administration to loosen restrictions on the drug, he wrote: \u201cUnborn babies are a source of profound joy for those who view them. Expectant parents eagerly share ultrasound photos with loved ones. Friends and family cheer at the sight of an unborn child. Doctors delight in working with their unborn patients \u2013 and experience an aesthetic injury when they are aborted.\u201d He has chafed legal traditionalists from the moment of his swearing-in, when he opted for the ceremony to be held in the private library of Harlan Crow \u2013 the conservative mega-donor who, ProPublica revealed, has lavished Clarence Thomas with trips on his yacht and paid the $6,000-a-month private school tuition for the justice\u2019s great-nephew. Ho worked as a clerk for Thomas in 2005. Ho vowed to boycott hiring Yale Law School graduates as clerks after students interrupted conservative speakers on campus, noting \u201ccancellations and disruptions seem to occur with special frequency\u201d at the Ivy League school. His caustic writings have drawn the spotlight while his wife, Allyson, has been working more inconspicuously, helping lay the legal foundation for conservative policies in her own work. She appears frequently as a speaker for the Federalist Society, the group that has led the conservative effort to reshape the judiciary. She has also worked pro bono for the Christian right organization First Liberty Institute, a group that describes its mission \u201cto defend and restore religious liberty in our schools, for our churches and houses of worship, inside the military, and throughout the public arena\u201d. It\u2019s unclear what Alliance Defending Freedom paid Allyson Ho to do, yet ending abortion is central among the organization\u2019s goals. The group helped write the Mississippi law that led to the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v Wade and ended the 50-year-old constitutional right to an abortion. Her husband\u2019s financial disclosures list descriptions of \u201cAcademy\u201d or \u201cFreedom Summit\u201d, next to some of the payments. The ADF hosts various legal trainings as part of its ADF Legal Academy that \u201cseamlessly combines outstanding legal training with an unwavering commitment to Christian principles\u201d and a Young Lawyers Academy. The Alliance Defending Freedom said: \u201cADF often invites lawyers of various backgrounds and experiences to speak at events. ADF offers honorariums for speaker participation. Allyson Ho is an exceptional lawyer with vast and diverse legal experience.\u201d A request to speak with Allyson Ho sent to Gibson Dunn has not been answered. The Texas senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, both Republicans, appointed Allyson to the state\u2019s committee responsible for recommending and vetting its recommendations to fill judicial vacancies. Neither Cruz nor Cornyn\u2019s offices responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for the names or dates of service for the judicial vetting committee nor did they respond to questions about what role, if any, Allyson had in her husband\u2019s nomination to the bench. In 2023, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, hired Allyson and Gibson Dunn, at a rate of $1,313 per hour \u2013 with a $7m cap \u2013 to represent the state in a decade-long legal battle in which a federal judge determined Texas had failed to protect foster children. The state had previously been represented by attorneys on its own payroll. The move to hire Allyson and her firm signaled that Texas could be looking to fight back against court orders mandating Texas comply with federal monitors appointed to ensure the safety of vulnerable children in its care by appealing district court rulings to the fifth circuit court of appeals \u2013 the court on which James Ho serves. The mifepristone case might just be the beginning of the Hos\u2019 influence, Gillers, the NYU professor, said. \u201cIf Trump wins the election, you\u2019ll see Ho on the short list of nominees to the supreme court,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is obviously behaving in a way that makes him a very prominent candidate in a Republican administration.\u201d That appointment could once again leave an empty office \u2013 one that some might want Allyson to fill.", "date": "2024-03-25", "section": "World news", "author": "Melissa Segura", "id": 321, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b9fb2acbaa1ecbdffac50d262a2148d1089802ee/1334_30_2666_1600/500.jpg"}, {"title": "All Things Are Too Small by Becca Rothfeld review \u2013 bracing and brilliant essay collection", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/25/all-things-are-too-small-by-becca-rothfeld-review-essays-in-praise-of-excess", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.143, "neu": 0.628, "pos": 0.229, "compound": 0.989}, "body": "Becca Rothfeld is a dynamo. I had not come across her before picking up All Things Are Too Small and was unprepared for the book\u2019s extraordinary clout and reach. She is an American journalist (a contributor to the New Yorker and the New York Times and a critic on the Washington Post), a philosopher, polemicist and a wit. She challenges, in this bracing, original and intellectually poised collection of essays, many of our unquestioning modern assumptions and, most persuasively, takes aim at the promotion of minimalism as an ideal for our living spaces, novels and ourselves. Nothing, in Rothfeld\u2019s view, succeeds like excess and she packs so much into her opening essay about why it is OK to want more (the most extravagant of Oliver Twists) that you feel richly fed before even turning the first page. She includes the 13th-century Dutch mystic Hadewijch of Brabant (from whom her title is taken), Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick, the critic James Wood and even makes time to sympathise with a random man sighted in a restaurant who wolfed down three dishes of pasta in a row, commenting that he wouldn\u2019t have had to have third helpings \u201cif any plate available were big enough\u201d. Inevitably, Rothfeld, revelling in plurality, does not neglect to launch a scornful attack on an obvious target: tidying guru Marie Kondo. She claims to be nonplussed by Kondo\u2019s notorious method, which she describes as \u201ctouching items to determine whether they \u2018spark joy\u2019, then summarily tossing anything that induces more complex emotions, or, God forbid, thought\u201d. To be thought-free is something of which Rothfeld herself is incapable. She rails against blank-slateism. She notes that \u201cthe mechanism by which tossing old T-shirts is supposed to effect rebirth remains hazy\u201d. She broods about whether \u201cstuffing the local landfill is sufficient to effect widespread egalitarian overhaul\u201d. And there is \u2013 naturally \u2013 more. She convincingly laments the decluttering of contemporary literature, which she believes has produced many self-involved, overpruned and fragmented novels. She includes a respectful yet highly critical and underwhelmed essay on Sally Rooney and her \u201cpolitically anodyne\u201d work. I enjoy trying to declutter and recognise the value of mindfulness (a decluttering, with any luck, of the mind) but this did not spoil my delight at her refreshingly unconvinced essay on the subject. She describes her \u201cvirtuous boredom\u201d trying to meditate and absolute lack of interest in what her own breath is doing. Above all, she denounces the way that meditation, as she sees it, encourages a defeatist passivity. In a fiercely unequal world, she argues, trying to persuade people to accept unfair circumstances is unacceptable. Mindfulness \u201cfalsely assumes that our dissatisfaction is always attributable to mental mismanagement, never to circumstances of genuine injustice\u201d. Elsewhere, Rothfeld writes where devils fear to tread \u2013 about sex, beauty and desire and about consumption and consummation. There is a brilliant and startling essay, The Flesh, It Makes You Crazy, which includes a description of the lust she feels for her husband. I kept wondering how he might feel about this tribute (imagining him, sitting in armchair, hands over eyes). The obvious question she gives rise to is: can you have \u2013 or be \u2013 too much of a good thing? She writes scaldingly about \u201cnew puritan\u201d writers Christine Emba and Louise Perry, and emphasises that the erotic is \u201cits own wild creature, for which there is (and can be) no established idiom\u201d. She exposes the stifling conservatism of Emba and Perry and the tyranny to which their prudish conclusions lead. In the acknowledgments, Rothfeld thanks her editor for \u201ctrusting me to write at ecstatic length\u201d. And it is part of her scintillating achievement, in this book of appetite, to make one vow never again to use the phrase \u201cless is more\u201d under any circumstances. And yet, having said that, it is also the case \u2013 whisper it \u2013 that Rothfeld, who writes with such zest, could have got away with painlessly trimming one or two of these essays. And this is because, as a brilliant and decisive iconoclast, she also has the potential to be precisely what she would like to avoid: a compendious miniaturist. \u2022 All Things Are Too Small: Essays in Praise of Excess by Becca Rothfeld is published by Little, Brown (\u00a320).

I remember sitting with great big earphones on listening to Here Comes the Sun. It\u2019s so melodic, cool and great. The song I inexplicably know every lyric to When I was about 16 or 17, we went on a rugby tour to France. For some reason we learned La Marseillaise \u2013 the national anthem of France \u2013 like a rugby tourist kind of thing. It\u2019s still stuck in my head. The best song to play at a party If you\u2019re my age, you\u2019ll remember that Jump Around by House of Pain is such a banger. Even if you\u2019re 18 or 19, the energy is still pretty good for a party. It\u2019s a cross-generational banger. The song I stream the most Romeo &amp; Julie by the Rifles, because it ends with a singalong, almost like a football anthem, so everybody joins in. If you\u2019ve seen them live, everybody knows it. The Rifles are one of my favourite bands, even though they\u2019ve never quite made it to the mainstream. The song I can no longer listen to Baby Shark. My little man\u2019s eight now, so I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to listen to it again. I\u2019m done with Baby Shark, thank you. The song I wish I\u2019d written Dry My Bones by this quirky Manchester indie band called the Slow Show. The lyrics are beautiful even though they are dealing with alcoholism and addiction. The song I secretly like but tell everyone I hate It\u2019s not very cool to like Simply Red, but Holding Back the Years is a top track. Mick Hucknall has got an incredible voice, an amazing energy. I know it\u2019s a bit hairdresser, in the background, but I actually quite like me some Simply Red. The song that changed my life Proof by I Am Kloot is probably the best track ever written. It was a record that was synonymous with me drinking. Music always connects to the soul and it\u2019s the most beautiful, wonderful, simple, amazing tune, but I\u2019m so pleased that part of my life isn\u2019t there any more. The song that gets me up in the morning Music is a huge part of kitchen life. Whoever comes in first puts on the radio or their own playlist because kitchens need energy. I\u2019ve never been in a kitchen that works in silence. There\u2019s no slow start. You don\u2019t gently wander into work and slowly build up to lunch. You have to drive it from the moment you get through the door. So, for me, anything by the Prodigy, but probably Firestarter. They\u2019re one of the best bands I\u2019ve ever seen live. The song I\u2019d like played at my funeral Pavarotti\u2019s Nessun Dorma. I\u2019m a big sports fan and Italia 90 was such a massive part of my life when I\u2019d just turned 17.

But The Russian Detective, a remarkable new graphic novel by Carol Adlam, takes its inspiration from more obscure sources. For some years, Adlam, an associate professor in the Nottingham School of Art and Design at Nottingham Trent University, and Claire Whitehead, a reader in modern languages at the University of St Andrew\u2019s, have been working together on the Lost Detective Project: a collaboration that draws on the work of long-forgotten writers of crime fiction who were contemporaries of Dostoevsky. As part of this project, Adlam has created several cross-media adaptations of their stories, of which The Russian Detective is one \u2013 and it could not be more rich or more beautiful if it tried. This is a book that repays multiple readings (and, for added pleasure, perhaps a little background reading). The fun starts with its endpapers: in the window of a fishmonger hang some huge red herrings. Take this as a warning. Adlam\u2019s book has tons of charm, not least its journalist-detective heroine, Charlotta Ivanovna, AKA Charlie Fox, a character she has described as a hybrid of Kate Warne, America\u2019s first female detective (Warne, who died in 1868, worked for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency), and the governess of the same name in Chekhov\u2019s play The Cherry Orchard (a gun-carrying eccentric who performs dramatic parlour tricks). But it\u2019s also a complicatedly plotted, intertextual visual feast: think I-Spy Russian Literature. I noted with a smile Dostoevsky\u2019s walk-on part as a grumpy rail passenger, and the seamstress whose clients include a Mrs Karenina. But I must admit that some of Adlam\u2019s other allusions \u2013 including a dream of Charlotta\u2019s that\u2019s taken from a passage in Alexander Pushkin\u2019s Eugene Onegin \u2013 passed me by at first. No matter. The book works on a more superficial level, too: a narrative that takes you back to the deep pleasures of childhood reading (I wonder if Adlam read Joan Aiken as a child, for it was Aiken as much as any Russian that I thought of as I turned its pages). It has an exciting \u2013 occasionally hard-to-follow \u2013 plot, in which Fox, a magician and a liar as well as newspaper reporter, grudgingly returns to her home town of Nowheregrad to investigate the murder of Elena Ruslanova, the daughter of a wealthy glass manufacturer. Here are footprints in blanketed snow, a little dog called Igoyok, a hot air balloon headed for Siberia, glamorous masked balls, Orthodox priests and a magic lantern theatre. But what really sets this exquisite book apart is its illustrations, so deeply atmospheric and so inordinately beautiful. Adlam is a deft caricaturist, an artist who can do a lot with a nose or a cheekbone. But this is as nothing to the way she incorporates different visual forms into her narrative, turning it, almost museum-like, into a luxuriant historical album. Woodcuts, newspaper cuttings, photogravure, even a thaumatrope: it feels like there\u2019s nothing she cannot do with her pen and her paintbrush \u2013 and if you fall for her talent as I have, and want to know more about the sources on which she has drawn so brilliantly, I recommend you look up a fascinating conversation from 2023 between her and Claire Whitehead in the academic journal Adaptation. \u2022 The Russian Detective by Carol Adlam is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a320).

Khoshbakht grew up in post-revolutionary Iran where he developed a love of movies and of moving images generally, even the sternly meagre output on national TV. I laughed out loud at Khoshbakht\u2019s entranced description of the TV\u2019s humble colour test card: \u201cAs exciting as an MGM musical!\u201d Khoshbakht (daringly) started a film club as a teenager, digitally projecting foreign movies videotaped from TV. He got into serious trouble for showing the Iranian classic The Cow by director Dariush Mehrjui, an anti-government protestor who was murdered last year (and sadly not included in the Oscars in memoriam section). But even more importantly, Khoshbakht got to know an extraordinary man called Ahmad Jorghanian, a dedicated rescuer of 35mm films and posters whom this film honours as the \u201cIranian Henri Langlois\u201d; that is, Iran\u2019s unofficial equivalent of the celebrated French archivist and preservationist, hero of the 60s French New Wave. But unlike Jorghanian, Langlois was never arrested and tortured for his westernised film collection. Jorghanian spent decades hoarding cans of film in his chaotic apartment and in cramped basements and hiding places all over Tehran, buying them from the warehouses and junk shops into which they had been dumped after being confiscated. Khoshbakht was able to project at least some of this illicit treasure trove on a samizdat basis, using borrowed projection facilities, and is ecstatic seeing these movies come to life once more. In exile in London, Khoshbakht hears about the death of his old friend, and ponders the fate of Jorghanian\u2019s collection: is film, like our own vulnerable human bodies, liable to decay into dusty nothingness?

The system will use machine learning to flex prices in response to supply and demand \u2013 in a similar way to that already deployed by cut-price airlines, cab-hailing services such as Uber and some hotels. Technology has made the technique increasingly popular with companies, but less so with their customers. The US burger chain Wendy\u2019s was forced to rush out a statement promising it \u201cwould not raise prices when our customers are visiting us most,\u201d \u2013 and only drop prices at less popular times \u2013 after announcing it would begin to trial surge pricing last month. Merlin said in a statement that the new system \u201cbrings us in line with competitors and the broader holiday industry that have similar pricing structures, which benefit guests who choose to book off-peak\u201d. It said the changes would \u201cenable greater flexibility for guests booking online to choose discounted prices for select dates and times.\u201d \u201cTo ensure we continue to deliver the best value and experience for our guests, we regularly review our pricing structure and admission prices in line with the marketplace and we reduce them in off peak periods. This also makes sure that the peak period experience is optimised by avoiding overcrowding. This approach clearly works because our guest satisfaction is at an all-time high.\u201d The scheme emerged as Merlin, which was taken private in 2019, revealed sales had risen 8% last year to a record \u00a32.1bn, led by the return of international tourists to big cities including London where the group operates the London Eye and the London Dungeon as well as Madame Tussauds.

Photos of the brass plate paying tribute to a supposedly deceased adulterer called Roger went viral last week, after it was affixed to a wooden bench on Royal York Crescent in the upmarket district of Clifton. Who put up the plaque commemorating the \u201chusband, father, adulterer\u201d \u2013 which included the payoff line \u201cRoger, I knew\u201d \u2013 remains unknown. But while locals speculated that Banksy may have been involved, another artist has now suggested they are the victim of a rip-off. The London-based creator, who operates under the name The Misfortuneteller, said he created a near-identical plaque in March 2020 after wandering around New York\u2019s Central Park and looking at the inscriptions on benches. \u201cPlaques are fine but they\u2019re not really that truthful,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do honest memorial plaques. Bittersweet ones.\u201d He mocked-up a series of images featuring offbeat tributes to the deceased. Some of the designs were sold as real engraved plaques. An ex-girlfriend is commemorated with a real-life plaque reading: \u201cFor Barbara \u2013 Who was awful when hungry but otherwise pretty solid.\u201d Others took on a life of their own after going viral, often being shared without credit or posted by meme aggregation accounts on Instagram. No one bought his design paying tribute to a \u201ccherished husband, dad and adulterer\u201d, even though the image proved popular online. As a result, The Misfortuneteller said he was surprised to see his original design and phrasing reappear on the Bristol bench this week, prompting him to say: \u201cIt\u2019s not Banksy\u2019s; it\u2019s fucking mine.\u201d Whoever put up the Bristol plaque had used almost exactly the same phrasing as the original 2020 design, albeit changing the name of the supposedly deceased adulterer. And while there is no suggestion they are seeking to profit from their actions, the original artist said they felt infuriated by the potential copyright infringement: \u201cI\u2019m mad at the person who took this, copied it, and put it on a bench. It\u2019s a reflection of how intellectual property these days is so hard to enforce.\u201d He said there was a tension between delight at creating work that resonated with the public and not receiving any credit for it. \u201cIt\u2019s just interesting how things go viral \u2013 on the one hard you should be pleased that you\u2019re amusing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if a million people like your post you get nothing from it.\u201d Drawing a parallel to the early days of illegal music downloads on the internet, the artist said: \u201cEven my followers say I should be happy. It\u2019s a bit like Napster \u2013 the internet is used to getting things for free and they expect to get everything for free and not to credit everybody. There\u2019s an assumption that if you find something amusing and share that the person doing it is doing really well.\u201d There is a long history of fake plaques in the UK. In 2013 a man emigrating to Australia left behind a bench inscription reading \u201cIn memory of Roger Bucklesby, who hated this park and everyone in it.\u201d A fake English Heritage blue plaque commemorating the residence of Victorian timetraveller Jacob von Hogflume appeared on a London townhouse in 2012. And the artist Gavin Turk created a plaque as a mocking tribute to his own importance while still a young artist. The Misfortuneteller insisted he did not want to stop others creating subversive plaques. He said he appreciated it was a powerful and effective medium: \u201cThere are other artists in my orbit who have attempted to do plaques. I have never said I own all plaques, just like I don\u2019t own ink and paper. I feel this is different because it\u2019s word-for-word.\u201d", "date": "2024-03-25", "section": "Art and design", "author": "Jim Waterson", "id": 328, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/78b4c89a314d89634bd4e9638d66ca3cbf989a09/0_746_3024_1814/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Tell us: what is your experience of choosing to be celibate?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/26/tell-us-what-is-your-experience-of-choosing-to-be-celibate", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.071, "neu": 0.611, "pos": 0.318, "compound": 0.7717}, "body": "A self-imposed dry spell might seem like a nightmare of deprivation to some, but for growing numbers of people there\u2019s a certain solace to be found in taking an interlude from romance.

Headshot is American writer Rita Bullwinkel\u2019s first novel, after her collection of stories Belly Up (2016), and it takes us deep into the world of teenage girl boxers. The setting is the 12th Annual Daughters of America Cup, held in the \u201ctin warehouse\u201d of Bob\u2019s Boxing Palace in Reno, Nevada: a two-day competition of fists and fury, with eight fighters in three knockout rounds. We get into the heads of all eight girls, the narrative passing easily from one to another through brief moments of connection. What\u2019s most impressive is how, in a relatively short novel with so many central characters, Bullwinkel manages to make each girl spark distinctively on the page \u2013 even if this means each tends towards a single overwhelming personality trait. There\u2019s Artemis Victor, the third in a line of boxing sisters (the judges treat her family \u201clike old friends\u201d), and in her own estimation the prettiest of the fighters in the tournament: \u201cThere\u2019s one woman, over there, who may be prettier, if you like women who look like drug addicts.\u201d But she is haunted by the knowledge that even if she wins, \u201cshe\u2019ll still be second best to her oldest sister\u201d. Artemis hates her opponent Andi Taylor, but wants to be her friend afterwards. The intimacy of the violence they\u2019re engaged in can do that. For Andi\u2019s part, she cannot stop ruminating on the sight of her father\u2019s dead body, and without him, \u201cshe needed another person in her life to tell her that she was a real person, and that she might not be special, but she was fine\u201d. Then there\u2019s Rachel Doricko, who likes to frighten people \u2013 \u201cit is amazing the power that a strange hat will give you\u201d \u2013 and her opponent Kate Heffer, who comes with plans and projects, which means that when they hit reality (or are hit by it), she collapses. We get glimpses of the audience too, mostly family members \u201capplauding for something, applauding for anything\u201d, but the girls are fundamentally alone. The fights themselves show the necessary blend of mental and physical endurance that approaches the metaphysical horror of the dance marathon in Horace McCoy\u2019s They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They? To the fighters, success \u2013 one \u201cwins quickly, like a mother putting toys away in a toy box at the end of the day\u201d \u2013 is all the sweeter because they know what it means to fail at something that means more to you than anything else. Headshot speaks of putting everything you\u2019ve got into one aspect of your life: \u201cA life taken over can be wonderful. But it can also be sappy and stupid and dramatic.\u201d What happens when the curtain goes down on the only thing you do? We get sly Muriel Spark-like shots forward to the future: \u201cWhen Artemis is 60 she won\u2019t be able to hold a cup of tea\u201d because of her boxing injuries. Another fighter will become an actor, \u201ca beloved typecast granny\u201d. Headshot feels like the complete deal in a way we rarely see in debut fiction: efficient, forceful, just messy enough to be interesting and leaving space in the ring for the reader. If this, after Kathryn Scanlan\u2019s Kick the Latch last year, is part of a new trend for fantastically unclassifiable books about women in sport, I\u2019m in. \u2022 Headshot by Rita Bullwinkel is published by Daunt Books (\u00a39.99).

A Spaniard who\u2019d spent years dancing in London with Rambert and was making waves with his choreography. But in 2009 he left to become artistic director at Sydney Dance Company, so this show is a bit of a homecoming. The triple bill, titled Ascent, opens with a short piece of Bonachela\u2019s own, I Am-ness, and it\u2019s a reminder of the quality of his choreography: 10 minutes of beautiful movement, set to the keening and soaring violin of Lonely Angel by Latvian composer P\u0113teris Vasks. It\u2019s less frenetic than some of Bonachela\u2019s early works, and takes time and pleasure in the facility of the four dancers in long, continuous, ever-evolving phrases. They\u2019re on their individual paths, but en route they connect, they embrace; they need each other. It\u2019s all very human, while being technically impressive \u2013 this is a company of strong, versatile dancers, and what they show in Ascent is work that\u2019s solidly movement and music-led, dancing round the edges of abstraction. Marina Mascarell\u2019s The Shell, a Ghost, the Host &amp; the Lyrebird opens feeling like early morning, with stillness and subdued light, and sparse shimmering music. From the ceiling fall ropes and swathes of fabric, like a ship\u2019s rigging, and there\u2019s the subtle impression of a voyage somewhere, choreography gently rocked by the water\u2019s undertow. It\u2019s a dreamy piece, although its potency wanes, not dissimilar to Antony Hamilton\u2019s Forever &amp; Ever, which is built like a big crescendo with a fizzle-out ending. Forever &amp; Ever looks fab though, and it\u2019s full of striking visual surprises, mostly courtesy of costume designer Paula Levis. The dancers emerge in hooded cloaks and cone-shaped hands, like a cross between The Traitors and a Pet Shop Boys gig. There is constant transformation, from monochrome to colour, from silence to a stark electro beat of increasing intensity, a slow build of adrenaline. The dancers are often tight to the music in a kind of 4/4 semaphore, slaves to the rhythm, but this is definitely not a party; it\u2019s very cool, very controlled. And it\u2019s very watchable.

Here are some yawn-worthy tasks to edit out of your life so you can have the summer you really want. 1 Attending formal meetings Transform dull sit-downs by keeping on the move with a walking meeting \u2013 taking in the air, the sights, the exercise gains! Works online with headphones or IRL with a colleague. 2 Wrestling with your lawnmower Why should you mow, when a Honda Miimo robotic lawnmower can do it? The robotic lawn-trimming champ Miimo is happy to take over, so get it set up then retire to the terrace to watch (or don\u2019t \u2013 the new range has Bluetooth connectivity as standard and the option for 3G/4G too). And if you want to keep things really simple, the HRM 1000 \u2013 with its pared-back display \u2013 is your friend. 3 Endless procrastination Do the thing! Don\u2019t just talk about your dreams, make them happen. Start the painting, write the book, train for that 5km run. A little at a time is better than not at all, so work out the smallest first step you can take and do that. 4 Taking the same old route Satnav is a godsend but also as adventurous as a plain baked potato. Instead, mix it up and go your own way; it\u2019ll make the journey feel more interesting and could help to keep your brain active, too. 5 Continually updating your socials Less is more. Constructing a plausible, yet aspirational, reality for anonymous onlookers is time consuming. Stick to a couple of posts a week \u2013 that way, your audience will be more pleased to see you. 6 Pruning Choose slow-growing evergreens, such as azaleas or dwarf rhododendrons, and back away from the secateurs. For structure, slow-growing dwarf conifers provide a wide range of colours and diverse shapes with minimal effort. All do well in glazed frost-proof containers if you like your plants on your patio. 7 Seeking garden perfection Not every corner of your garden needs to be manicured and pristine. Rewild a section and let nature take its course. The bumblebees will thank you and the random, tangled beauty of it all will make quite the contrast. Tip: the Honda Miimo lets you leave some longer meadow sections for greater biodiversity. 8 Stressing over gift shopping When you see something you love, buy it, and keep it until you\u2019ve worked out who it\u2019s for. A go-to gift cupboard prevents an afternoon wasted hunting for last-minute panic buys. 9 Wondering what to wear Have a couple of hangers of trusted outfits on standby, always ready to go. For some reason, picking out clothes the night before takes half as long \u2013 perhaps because you\u2019re more awake \u2013 and means the befuddled morning version of you has one less fire to fight. 10 Waiting in for deliveries You never hear the doorbell anyway. If you\u2019re able, click-and-collect is the one. It gets you out of the house, or gives you a nice diversion on the way home from wherever you\u2019ve been having much more fun. 11 Counting down to holidays There\u2019s more to time off than your bumper vacation. There\u2019s joy to be found in a day off here and there, doing something local, lowkey and fun \u2013 maybe even a little hands-off gardening, watching your Miimo gobble up grass while you relax. 12 Weeding Weeds can\u2019t thrive where there\u2019s no light, so make your flowerbeds too busy for invaders to get a look in. Cotoneaster dammeri (also known as bearberry cotoneaster) is evergreen, produces attractive berries, and is ideal for ground cover, along with evergreen pachysandras, also known as green carpet. 13 Spending forever cleaning Set yourself a time limit and be realistic about what can be done. To make it feel more fun and stave off boredom, spruce up the place in zones, stick on a playlist or set challenges for yourself as you do it. How many colour-themed things can you put away? It works! 14 Feeling guilty about being inside on a summer\u2019s day It\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to spend all day gently baking in the sunshine. Give yourself permission to binge on a box set or read on the sofa (all while Miimo does the hard work for you and keeps your lawn in tiptop shape). 15 Watching reality TV They fight, they make up, they fight again, they take longer to make up, and repeat \u2013 until you realise you\u2019ve been stationary for eight hours. There is no plot, so don\u2019t lose your own. 16 Hovering over high maintenance plants Open to feeling the dirt under your fingernails but don\u2019t want to be tied to attention-seeking flora? Cherry tomatoes, asparagus, beans, onions and peppers pretty much do their own thing once planted, you just need to show up with the water and an encouraging smile. 17 Jumping on a work call A \u201cquick call\u201d almost never is. Ask for, or offer, an emailed precis instead. Everyone can read at their leisure, be more focused, and not feel under pressure to find immediate solutions. And if it has to be a call, be sure it has an agenda \u2013 and therefore an end in sight. 18 Waiting for your phone to charge A battery pack doesn\u2019t take up much space, so you\u2019ll always be connected, and you can keep up with the group chat while you\u2019re out in the garden. 19 Ordering the same thing at a restaurant Favourites are favourites for a reason, but how did they become your most-loved foods? Because you took a chance and tried them the first time, right? Open your mind and enrich your palate. 20 Endless to-do lists Start a tiny, achievable one to feel that rush of completion. 21 Cleaning garden furniture Invest in a good quality hardwood set of garden furniture that can withstand the elements and doesn\u2019t require any treatment, such as iroko, teak, or sapele mahogany. 22 Saying yes to things you don\u2019t want to do Stop doing things you don\u2019t want to (you could start with letting a robotic lawnmower such as the Honda Miimo sort your lawn out instead of putting in the hard work yourself), and you could literally find yourself with hours of extra time on your hands to do the things you actually enjoy.

From our longlist of 16 fantastic titles, my fellow judges Venetia La Manna, Nicola Rollock, Anne Sebba, Kamila Shamsie and I have chosen a shortlist of six must-read books. The first (in order of author\u2019s surname) is Thunderclap, by Observer art critic Laura Cumming. The author draws attention to the genius of an overlooked artist, Carel Fabritius and, by extension, makes us look anew at the whole of Dutch art. Amid this she weaves in sections of memoir about her artist father. Deeply researched and meticulously wrought, this is tender, electric and highly original. Cumming has a real gift for putting paintings into words: she helps the reader to see things that they might have otherwise missed. She is a master of structure, and her diction is gorgeous, while the revelation on the last page is breathtakingly poignant. From the starting point of Naomi Klein\u2019s discomfort at being continually mistaken for the \u201cother Naomi\u201d, feminist turned conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf, Doppelganger spirals out to examine the tribal nature of politics today. Klein, writer, climate activist and Guardian US columnist, gives us language with which to conceive of the \u201cmirror world\u201d in which we find ourselves. Her forensic dissection of the strange political realities we are living amid is elegantly crafted into a narrative arc. Doppelganger is deeply clever, original and insightful, and also that harder thing for a book of nonfiction: humorous. A Flat Place by Noreen Masud is a beguiling mix of landscape and memory. By meditating on the nature of flat topography \u2013 that it conveys an undemanding sense of security and peace \u2013 and contrasting that with her harrowed and confined childhood, the lecturer at the University of Bristol constructs something utterly original and haunting. Her beautiful and tender prose inducts one into a completely new way of seeing the world \u2013 a vision that is absorbing, evocative and memorable. Harvard professor Tiya Miles\u2019s All That She Carried is a work of monumental historical excavation. With extraordinary imagination, Miles tells the story of a sack given in the 1850s by a woman called Rose to her nine-year-old daughter, Ashley, when Ashley was being sold away from her. The sack was later embroidered by Ashley\u2019s granddaughter. Miles uses this artefact to investigate the hidden lives of enslaved women. Carefully judged, deeply researched, and exquisitely written, All That She Carried is a masterclass in how to contend with the absences of enslaved people in the archives. It brims with intelligence and love. Code Dependent is an astute and gripping examination of how existing imbalances of power are being replicated, even exacerbated, by AI. Madhumita Murgia, the Financial Times\u2019s first artificial intelligence editor, deeply understands tech, but her primary interest is the humanity behind it. The power of this book lies in the rich stories it tells of individuals confronting new manifestations of very old power structures. Drawing on interviews from around the globe, this highly readable and deeply important book exposes AI\u2019s sordid underbelly. The poet Safiya Sinclair turns her hand to memoir in How to Say Babylon, an exquisite book about growing up in a Rastafarian family in Jamaica. As a work of autobiography, it is moving, poignant, and even distressing, but Sinclair also tells an illuminating broader story about postcolonial Jamaica, religious fundamentalism, and patriarchy \u2013 and how a mother\u2019s love can almost overcome it all. Beautifully written and original in its use of language, it is also a wonderfully compelling read and utterly unforgettable. On the surface, these books tell six very different stories, spanning continents and centuries. Yet these writers are not only all deft of phrase and original in approach, but each responds uniquely to perceived injustice. They remind us how important it is to heed the perspectives that women bring. \u2022 The winner of the 2024 Women\u2019s prize for nonfiction will be announced on 13 June.

Shares rose again in volatile trading on Wednesday, rising 14% and valuing it at $9.6bn. That enormous success has raised questions, and not all of them are easy to answer. How can it possibly be worth $9bn? The glib answer is \u201cbecause the most recent price someone bought a share of the company at is $66.46\u201d. The valuation of a publicly traded company such as Truth Social \u2013 officially, the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp, with the stock ticker DJT, referencing its founder\u2019s initials \u2013 is just a product of multiplying the value of an individual share with the number outstanding. Typically, that value, known as the market capitalisation, is kept in check by reference to the \u201cfundamentals\u201d of the company: how much money it makes or loses, and how fast it is growing or shrinking. But sometimes \u2026 it isn\u2019t. In the case of Truth Social, its revenue during the first nine months of last year was just $3.3m from advertising, and it recorded a loss of $49m. Why don\u2019t investors care about the fundamentals? Historically, the big reason why stock valuations become detached from reality is speculative bubbles. Even if you don\u2019t think a company is particularly valuable, it may still be worth buying their stock at a high price if you think you can sell it on at an even higher price. But Truth Social seems to be part of a more recent phenomenon: the \u201cmeme stock\u201d. What is a meme stock? The term was coined to describe a small group of publicly traded stocks that have attracted a big proportion of private \u201cretail\u201d investors. Those investors typically use zero-commission trading apps such as Robinhood to take a much more active role in the markets than has been typical for individuals until recently, and coordinate on social media, particularly sites such as Reddit, to share stock tips. Infamously, the valuation of the American video game retailer GameStop rose by more than 1,800%, after a critical mass of investors coordinated on the WallStreetBets subreddit to take a stake. The investors\u2019 theory was that an engineered \u201cshort squeeze\u201d could force those who had \u201cshorted\u201d GameStop \u2013 that is, bet on its share price falling \u2013 to buy the shares back at inflated valuations. Three years on, GameStop remains almost 10 times more valuable than it was just before it achieved meme stock status \u2013 and just a quarter off its peak. Is Truth Social a true meme stock? Investors in Donald Trump\u2019s social network definitely have a lot in common with those in the GameStop bubble. Coordinating online to boost a share\u2019s value with lots of little investments from individuals, rather than big corporate investors, is a similar story to GameStop and other meme stocks such as the cinema chain AMC or the rental company Hertz. But unlike those shareholders, there is little sense that the Truth Social investors are driven by, or even care about, turning a profit on their stake. Instead, buying in is seen as a chance to invest in Trump \u2013 or even just to show your support for the man. In that way, Truth Social has less in common with other meme stocks and more with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies \u2013 a market the former president has also dabbled in. Can Trump sell out early? With legal bills in the millions \u2013 including one reduced this week from $454m to a still hefty $175m \u2013 the big question for many is whether the Truth Social float will allow Trump to turn his newfound paper wealth into hard cash. Officially, the answer is a simple \u201cno\u201d: the IPO agreement requires insiders to hold their stake for six months after the company goes public. But that can be overruled by a vote from the company\u2019s board of directors, which includes such independent votes as Donald Trump Jr, and Linda McMahon and Robert Lighthizer, two former officials in Trump\u2019s administration. Even if they choose not to authorise a sale, they may offer a halfway house, rewriting the agreement so that Trump Sr can use his shares as collateral for a loan. Will Truth Social ever make money? A few years ago, it was possible to foresee a rosy future for Truth Social. The increasing polarisation of American society meant the conditions were ripe for a rightwing social network, in contrast to the Silicon Valley ideology that dominated online. Truth Social, with its backing from Trump, felt like the most likely to succeed in that space, against the 4chan-inflected tone of its precursor Gab and the Trump-allied site Parler. Then Elon Musk bought Twitter. Under the billionaire\u2019s ownership, the site, rebranded as X, has become the home of the online right on its own, shedding a fifth of its users in the process.

But how can you work out what suits the moment? And the best way to get rid of a stink? Perfumers reveal how to make your world smell fantastic. 1. Smell is an extreme sensation \u201cScent provokes a visceral reaction,\u201d says Ezra-Lloyd Jackson, a perfumer and artist who makes wearable fragrances under the brand name deya and creates scent installations for art exhibitions. What fascinates him about working with scent is the process of transforming \u201csomething that is grotesque or alarming into something that is familiar and comforting, or vice versa\u201d. 2. Your reaction to a smell is linked to memory Maya Njie makes perfumes inspired by her Swedish and Gambian heritage. She tried to capture this feeling in other artistic forms before realising that what she really wanted was to portray the way it smelled. \u201cWe know that our sense of smell is directly linked to the part of the brain where our memories are stored,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it makes a lot of sense that fragrance and smells are connected to our memories. If you smell something that someone has worn, or you go to a house that belongs to your grandparents, smelling makes you feel way more emotional than a photo ever could.\u201d Jackson describes this as \u201cinternal time travel. It is another form of communication that isn\u2019t linguistic.\u201d 3. It is possible to train your nose \u201cThat is what perfume is all about,\u201d says Jackson. He didn\u2019t have a very orthodox route into perfumery: \u201cI went straight into a laboratory and got to work, but most people will train at one of the schools in France, where the first year is all about learning 500 smells.\u201d Brighton-based French perfumer Elodie Durande, who works for Somerset label Ffern, honed her craft at the University of Montpellier. \u201cYou start out by working on your olfactory skills, remembering smells and describing smells,\u201d before receiving a wide-ranging education about the perfume industry, she says. Learning about scent applies not just to those who work in it, but those who wear it, too. \u201cYou can figure out what scent suits you by literally going around in your regular life and being sure to smell,\u201d says Mandy Aftel, a natural perfumer who lives in Berkeley, California and runs a fragrance museum, the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents. \u201cParticipate more in your life, bring your consciousness into a cup of coffee or when you\u2019re baking; smell the oven and the smells of baking will evolve. All we need to do is close our eyes, inhale and be there. And it will become clear to you what you like.\u201d 4. You can change how you feel about a smell \u2013 if you want to \u201cIf there is a perfume that someone wore when you were younger and it makes you feel uncomfortable, or an ex-partner wore a perfume and you smell it again, it can be interesting to reclaim that smell,\u201d says Njie. \u201cSo instead of smelling it every now and again, and feeling the way that you do, you would buy a sample of it and start wearing it \u2013 doing things that make you dissociate from that particular person. You can recreate memories and connections to it.\u201d But you should proceed with caution, advises Aftel: \u201cIf a fragrance reminds you of someone who stopped your heart, you should avoid it. It is a part of who you are and that should be honoured. On the other hand, if you really got over that person, it may be a victory dance to feel that it no longer bothers you. But it has to be an evolution inside of you.\u201d 5. Take your time choosing a fragrance You need to be in the right mood when shopping for a new scent, explains Lyn Harris, the perfumer behind the Perfume H and Miller Harris labels. \u201cIt\u2019s like choosing an item of clothing \u2013 you have to be calm and not in a rush.\u201d Don\u2019t be intimidated by fragrance, she says. Tell the sales assistant the kind of things you like and they will help you to find something. 6. Pick a fragrance for the time of year \u201cFind a fragrance that fits you for the season,\u201d says Harris. \u201cI think that is key because that is how we treat our wardrobe in general; it needs to be reinvigorated and fragrance is the same, because it will stop working for you just like that. So go into it thinking, \u2018I am going to have one for spring. What do I want? Do I want something fresh? Do I want something green?\u2019 And then in the winter, you may think, \u2018I want something to cocoon me, to nurture me but smell sexy at the same time.\u2019\u201d 7. Test it on your skin \u201cOnce you\u2019ve found two fragrances that you quite like and they\u2019re doing something for you olfactory-wise, try them on your skin,\u201d says Harris. \u201cOne fragrance on each wrist and perhaps another somewhere up your arm. Try no more than three. It is quite good to take a tester card and then, maybe later in the day, check it and see if it\u2019s doing anything for you. But that initial skin contact and your reaction to it is very important. It should be giving you pleasure; making you feel inquisitive and emotional. Give it three to five minutes and if it\u2019s still working, that\u2019s a positive.\u201d Fragrance comes to life on the skin, says Njie. \u201cTemperature plays a part, which is why we spray on pulse points and it is why fragrance may come alive more in the summer, whereas in the winter it may be flatter.\u201d 8. Wear what you like, not what you think you should like Fragrance has traditionally been marketed as \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d \u2013 interestingly, certain flowery notes were once considered the latter \u2013 and something used to attract the object of your affection, says Njie, who makes gender neutral perfumes. \u201cBut really, all those lines are so blurred\u201d \u2013 now, it is more about \u201cmaking you feel a certain way about yourself, more confident or secure or all of these different emotions that fragrance can bring to us\u201d. 9. Scent can be used to lift or reflect your mood \u201cAll of my perfumes are very mood driven,\u201d says Aftel. \u201cI have some perfumes that are sad, some that are kind of sexy for a date night, others that are relaxing \u2013 like being in nature in the trees.\u201d They can also be chosen to mark a special occasion, such as a birthday, wedding or significant life change. \u201c[You can] dedicate a particular scent to it that isn\u2019t an every day one,\u201d says Jackson, setting yourself up to make new memories with your chosen fragrance. 10. Spritz where you will most enjoy it \u201cI spray on my wrist and on the back of my neck,\u201d says Njie, \u201cbecause I find that if you spray it at the front, you smell it constantly and get used to the fragrance faster than you would if it wasn\u2019t in your peripheral area the whole time. I like to spray it on my clothes, if I feel as if I\u2019ve got fabric that can handle it; I like it on a coat sleeve before I leave the house \u2013 that way I can access it more easily. My hair is very short but I know that the girls in the studio spray a bit and walk into it and it wafts in your hair throughout the day.\u201d Durande agrees that wearing perfume on your chest means you sense it too much, which soon means that \u201cyou can\u2019t consciously smell it anymore\u201d. The trick instead is to \u201ctry to apply it to different parts of your body, on your wrist or even on your legs \u2013 anywhere that has motion. That way, when you move, you will get a whiff of perfume.\u201d 11. Don\u2019t be too overpowering \u201cIt is good to keep other people in mind,\u201d says Njie. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in smaller spaces, travelling or working in an office, you may want to take others into account. I don\u2019t believe that if a fragrance reaches across the room and it is eye-watering, then it means that it is good and you have got a lot for your buck. Something that is subdued and more sophisticated can be equally as beautiful. It is nice to have a smell that is more intimate \u2013 that people who come close to you get to enjoy.\u201d Harris agrees: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s tasteful to invade other people\u2019s space with fragrance. It should be for you and those immediately close to you.\u201d When you can no longer smell your fragrance, reapply it to a different part of the body, suggests Durande. 12. Choose something that will last \u201cAnything with a deeper smell \u2013 something woody, ambery, richer \u2013 and sweeter scents like vanilla or caramels \u2026 these are all base notes, the longer lasting ingredients,\u201d says Durande. \u201cPerfumes that contain these will retain on the skin for a bit longer.\u201d 13. Think sustainably Njie\u2019s eponymous brand is vegan and \u201coffers refills, and uses recycled glass and paper packaging\u201d. But sustainability in perfume is not always straightforward, so make sure you read up on how brands operate before you buy. \u201cNatural does not equal being more sustainable or safer to wear,\u201d she says. \u201cIn certain cases, the synthetic molecules are better, as they carry a lower carbon footprint and fewer allergens.\u201d 14. How to tell a dupe The internet is awash with cunning copies of notable perfumes, and it can be hard to tell a real fragrance from a fake one. \u201cIf it is a really good dupe, you can\u2019t really tell,\u201d says Durande. \u201cIf it is a perfume that you\u2019ve been wearing for many years, every day, and you have a good sense of smell, you will probably pick up tiny differences. Because dupes are never 100% the same, even the good ones.\u201d 15. Sometimes it is better not to wear anything Durande barely wears fragrance. \u201cI work with smells all day long, all week, so in my free time I need a bit of a reset. I like to be in a neutral environment, to give my nose a bit of a rest,\u201d she says. Being scent-free at work, she explains, means that she can concentrate on smelling her creations all the better. 16. In the home, embrace how life smells Don\u2019t automatically turn to a candle or incense to give a room character, says Aftel. \u201cA lot of people will scent their home with those tired old fragranced candles that are quite synthetic. But how lovely would it be, say at a dinner party, to put out things that are fragrant that are not a candle, that encourage people to touch them. With a bowl of oranges, the oil is in the skin and they are very beautiful to look at. Or maybe having a little bouquet of mint so people can rip a leaf off. Or, if you have jasmine where you live, put that on the table with a bowl of peaches \u2013 they look and smell incredible together. I grow lemons so I always have a bowl of them out. Something very simple like that is a beautiful way to include fragrance in your life.\u201d Jackson, meanwhile, likes to embrace the smells of cooking rather than mask them, especially \u201ccardamom, frying sage with butter and cumin, honey and carrots \u2013 a match made in heaven\u201d. 17. Make your own scent rituals Njie does use candles and incense in her home. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I tend to do more after I\u2019ve done my chores, and it is time to relax. It\u2019s like a reward for doing something. I wouldn\u2019t light a candle if I\u2019ve got loads of stuff to do.\u201d Durande opts for palo santo or Papier d\u2019Arm\u00e9nie, which reminds her of childhood, for a similar unwinding effect. Jackson cannily sprays radiators with fragrance \u2013 as they warm, the scent is released. 18. To remove the smell of garlic from hands \u2026 \u201cWash your hands with cold water first,\u201d says Durande, \u201cbecause the hot water opens up the pores in your skin. If you clean up with hot water, some of those garlic smells are going to be trapped deeper in your skin. I\u2019ve noticed that if you rinse off or wash your hands with cold water first, it removes it better. You don\u2019t get so much in your skin, and then you can do a second wash with warm water and soap.\u201d 19. Consider your laundry detergent \u201cThe stuff that people use to scent laundry sticks around for so long,\u201d says Aftel. \u201cI believe very strongly in a person choosing to engage with a smell and choosing when it comes to an end. So if you have stuff that lasts for a really long time, or blankets things, I feel like the person smelling it may falsely think they don\u2019t like it, or that it\u2019s too much. A natural smell has an arc over time. They last, then \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013 disappear.\u201d 20. To get rid of a bad smell \u2026 \u201cI would just open a window and get a draught going,\u201d says Njie. \u201cBecause otherwise you\u2019re layering over the bad smell \u2013 it is better to try to get rid of it.\u201d Aftel suggests putting frankincense resin over a tea light: \u201cIt fills your house with a beautiful, natural smell and you could cover something up with that very easily.\u201d Aside from that, she adds, simply \u201copen the windows and pray\u201d.", "date": "2024-03-28", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Sarah Phillips", "id": 336, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0de23a81fc70e859e290fdceacc7a8caefaade4a/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Canada school boards accuse social media firms of \u2018rewiring\u2019 how kids think", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/28/canada-school-lawsuit-social-media-rewire-kids", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.074, "neu": 0.718, "pos": 0.208, "compound": 0.9823}, "body": "Four of Canada\u2019s largest school boards have launched a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the social media companies Meta, Snap Inc and ByteDance, accusing them of acting in a \u201chigh-handed, reckless, malicious, and reprehensible manner\u201d with products the boards claim harm student learning and \u201crewire\u201d how children think. The four district boards \u2013 Ottawa-Carleton, Toronto, Peel and Toronto Catholic \u2013 filed four separate statements of claim in Ontario\u2019s superior court of justice on Wednesday. \u201cThe lawsuit claims that social media products, negligently designed for compulsive use, have rewired the way children think, behave, and learn, leaving educators and schools to manage the fallout,\u201d the boards said in a statement, adding the companies used \u201cexploitative business practices\u201d and chose to \u201cmaximize profits\u201d instead of focusing on the mental health and wellbeing of students. None of the allegations have been proven in court. In recent years, educators have spend a growing share of their time in the classroom attempting to get students to focus, the boards said. They blame the addictive nature of social media and apps like Instagram, TikTok and SnapChat which they say have also led to a spike in cyberbullying and mental health issues. To compensate for mounting administrative costs of the fallout, as well as the \u201cstrain\u201d on the teachers, the boards are seeking C$4.5bn (US$3.3bn) from the companies. The lawsuit is the first of its kind in Canada, but follows similar efforts in the United States amid a growing concern over the developmental effects of social media on young users. In a statement Snap said the platform was \u201cintentionally designed to be different from traditional social media\u201d so that users could communicate with friends. \u201cWhile we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence,\u201d the company said.

However the BBFC is evidently not bothered by the foxhunting scene in which the fox has a cod Irish accent (perhaps because chimney sweep Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, saves the fox), nor by the cheerful suicide reference made by one of the servants: \u201cNice spot there by Southwark Bridge, very popular with jumpers!\u201d In an upmarket part of Edwardian London created on almost dreamlike artificial sets in California, the prosperous upper-middle-class Banks family are having problems controlling their high-spirited children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice); this is grumpy banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns), who is always whirling around going to votes-for-women marches. Pompous Mr Banks saunters into the action with complacent song The Life I Lead (which melodically owes a tiny bit to With a Little Bit of Luck from the stage show My Fair Lady). And so the magical nanny Mary Poppins wafts miraculously down from the heavens to solve all their problems \u2013 and this is the glorious movie debut of Julie Andrews, glowing with health and beauty and confidence. Andrews will always be associated with this superb performance, and of course her later appearance in The Sound of Music, in which she also artlessly cures a family\u2019s woes. I have always preferred Andrews in The Sound of Music, because defying the Nazis is more exciting and worthwhile than wimpishly going on a jolly holiday, and feeding the (verminous) birds at tuppence a bag etc. But no one can doubt the lethal power of Mary Poppins. (Naming Mary\u2019s preferred alcoholic cocktail is always a great film quiz standby.) But when uptight Mr Banks takes the kids to his place of employment and young Michael inadvertently causes the biggest run on a bank since Frank Capra\u2019s It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, this stern paterfamilias loses his position and is forced to consider his whole life and how he has been neglecting his children in favour of work (although happily it\u2019s not a quandary he\u2019s in for very long). It is Mary who introduces the children to the madcap chimney sweep Bert, played by Van Dyke with his notoriously awful cockney accent \u2013 which is even more awful considering that Hermione Baddeley is right there, robustly playing the Banks family\u2019s maid Ellen, and giving us a much more convincing London voice. (Actually, Van Dyke\u2019s posh voice as old Mr Dawes is much better.) From the first time I saw this film as a kid, and again now, I have always wondered: are Bert and Mary in love or not? Mary sings to him: \u201cGentlemen like you are few / Though you\u2019re just a diamond in the rough, Bert / Underneath, your blood is blue / You\u2019d never think of pressing your advantage / Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed / A lady needn\u2019t fear when you are near \u2026\u201d Pressing his \u201cadvantage\u201d? A lady not needing to fear? Well, I should hope not, though perhaps poor Bert certainly does have a hopeless platonic thing for Mary, possibly the most romantically unattainable figure in film history. She is also arguably a manic pixie dream nanny, though it\u2019s Bert who is also manic, particularly when he does his interminable Step in Time rooftop knees-up with all the other sweeps. There are lots of genius moments here, and A Spoonful of Sugar and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious are amazing songs. I have to admit that I find the real brilliance of the film is in the first act and things have wound down by the end, but what an entertainment sugar rush. \u2022 Mary Poppins is in UK cinemas from 29 March, and also screening in select Australian cinemas.", "date": "2024-03-28", "section": "Film", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "id": 339, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c3b655bf167fae8d19c06b8faf69b0fce9576a3d/0_128_1691_1015/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Sporting leaders, racing waiters and lots of rescued cats \u2013 take the Thursday quiz", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/28/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-153", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.104, "neu": 0.668, "pos": 0.228, "compound": 0.8265}, "body": "The Thursday quiz would like to start this week with an apology to regular readers.

Taking place only every 10 years, each edition of Modstock is a three-day and all-night event with vintage car shows, talks and panels, live music, market stalls, a scooter run, club nights, and a Thames boat party. \u201cWe are celebrating the culture which has, over the last six decades, influenced a lot of things in this country \u2013 particularly music and fashion, which is two of our greatest exports,\u201d said Bailey. Modstock will take place in west London, and welcomes 60s icons including the singers PP Arnold and Fay Hallam and the drummer Kenney Jones. It will also host bands, DJs, clothes makers, vintage car sellers and more who were not around in the 60s but drew great inspiration from it. Bailey said: \u201cWe are having people from all over the world. Mod now is not just something that is unique to the UK, it\u2019s worldwide and the fanbase is always changing it in their own ways.

Davidson has been a 60s fanatic since he was a university student in the early 1980s. He began dressing up in 60s suits, driving vintage vehicles and throwing events with the guidance of his father. As the internet community of mod-style lovers grew, he began connecting with other people from around the world who share his interest.

But we\u2019re spread out all over the place, so it\u2019s fun to have so many people in the same place for this.\u201d Modstock has attracted mod and 60s fanatics from across generations, with some younger attenders keen to learn more from the older generations. Alexandra Mason, 24, is travelling from Stoke on Trent in Staffordshire to take part in the festivities. This is her first Modstock, although she has been attending mod and 60s events for several years. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see some 60s icons performing because it\u2019s not often you can do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m especially excited for PP Arnold because she\u2019s always been an inspiration to me as a female musician, and she\u2019s an incredible woman with an amazing life.\u201d Mason will perform at Modstock with her band, The Crystal Teardrop. \u201cWe have an affection for classic artists such as the Beatles and the Kinks alongside West Coast favourites including the Great Society, Love and the Byrds,\u201d she said. They were invited to play the event by Bailey and the organising team,. Mason said: \u201cWe are delighted to be part of Modstock \u2013 music will always be a vital part of the mod scene and we hope we can make our own contribution to making the weekend really special.\u201d", "date": "2024-03-30", "section": "Culture", "author": "Aneesa Ahmed", "id": 341, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/88d35804e4319841bcb97d71398e3c03d974af3d/0_153_4324_2594/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Four Stars: A Life.

Sometimes it\u2019s implicit \u2013 in the gentle placement of a magazine in a suburban WH Smith, for example. And sometimes it is absolutely, gravel-in-the-eyes explicit \u2013 as in the opening of pubs but not labour wards during the first Covid-19 lockdown. This oily cultural assumption, which some of the more sharp-eyed among you might have noticed tends to follow seams of gender and class, has been one of my biggest beefs in the past decade. So it is disquieting, I\u2019ll admit, to read a book with whole chapters dedicated to, say, the Hi-Tec squash shoe in white and dark green, the McDonald\u2019s Chicken Big Mac, Football Manager and the Ohto Horizon needle point pen, and to find it funny. At times, brilliant. But that\u2019s what Joel Golby has written and that\u2019s what I thought and that\u2019s what will, I am sure, delight, charm and move his readers. Golby\u2019s eye for detail, scouring wit, speed-skater handling of language and mournful take on modern neuroses is just as hilarious as connoisseurs of his journalism would expect. That the subjects are petty and insignificant is the whole point; it\u2019s while tap dancing along this footpath of trivialities that he stubs his toe on something more substantial, like, say, loneliness, masculinity or grief. The conceit of Four Stars is a memoir presented as a series of reviews. So, for instance, the aforementioned squash shoe gets five stars; violence \u2013 by way of a late\u2011night encounter in Surrey Quays Tesco while looking for a specific brand of American-style mustard \u2013 gets two stars; \u201cBeing Trapped In A Toilet In Spitalfields Market And Like 16 People Watching Me Come Out Once They Finally Got The Door Down\u201d gets zero stars. There is a recurring cast of characters; some real, some contrived. There is Gemma, Golby\u2019s girlfriend, who becomes the subject of a very When Harry Met Sally series of counterintuitive observations, including: \u201cI love that she mopes about the house in a huge hooded dressing gown that stinks and has coffee stains all down it\u201d; or \u201cI love the mad vampiric way she sleeps with her hands clasped\u201d. There is Michael, his considerate, concerned friend. There is also a neanderthal Golby who acts as a literary mechanism for self-reproach and, towards the end of the book, joins an imagined pub conversation between Golby and his late father. Of course, a review of a memoir is a review of a book, not a life. Whether you enjoy Four Stars will have more to do with whether you enjoy Golby\u2019s writing than whether you have also seen \u201cA Frankly Irresistible Offer On M\u00fcller Corners While You Were On The Way To What Is Technically A Party\u201d. And the writing is good. But it is also true that some of the observations, experiences and anecdotes will speak very specifically to a trend-chasing, metropolitan, brand-obsessed hedonist. Is it niche to take an interest in \u00a365 T-shirts, Staropramen, Agaric Fly incense, Westfield Stratford and almond croissants? Not necessarily. Is being relatable the hallmark of a good book? Absolutely not. Does it make me feel self-conscious that I\u2019m giving a book called Four Stars a five-star rating? You bet. \u2022 Four Stars: A Life.

We met online six years ago via a website for married people who want to cheat. Recently, we both left our spouses and brought our relationship out into the open, which has changed our sex life. Affair sex was always charged, but it was also a bit of a rush: we\u2019d try to have sex three times in four hours to make the most of the hotel booking. Or we\u2019d meet in a National Trust car park and have a five-minute tryst in a quiet coppice. I\u2019d go home with suspicious insect bites all over my bottom. These days, Jessica and I are discovering the joy of sex in a proper bedroom. We do it leisurely, on weekend mornings, and then read each other the papers. I\u2019m in my 60s but I\u2019ve never had this kind of regular, loving, \u201crelationship\u201d sex before. My ex-wife was uninterested in a physical life with me. We got married very young and I\u2019m not sure she ever really fancied me. Before I met Jessica, my unhealthy way of coping was to meet someone online twice a year, shag them for a few weeks then cut it off. I\u2019d spend the next six months trying to resist the website, but I\u2019d always crack. After I left my marriage, I wasn\u2019t sure I was able to commit to Jessica. I didn\u2019t want to repeat my pattern of being the \u201caffair guy\u201d and start cheating on her. She had her doubts, too: we were good at having secret sex, but would we be good at going to Tesco together? Or running a house? Starting out as an affair facilitates a ruthless sort of honesty \u2013 your partner already knows the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done, so it\u2019s easier to say the unsayable. We had a lot of frank conversations about whether we should attempt a real relationship. Love has crept up slowly on us, but that has made our connection deeper. Extreme honesty remains the cornerstone of our partnership. We discuss friends of ours who have had affairs, and regularly ask one another whether all of our needs are being met. So far the answer has been \u201cyes\u201d, but I think we could be truthful about it if the answer were ever \u201cno\u201d. Jessica, 58 I decided to have an affair because I wanted a bit of pleasure that was just for me My ex-husband was very controlling. He eroded my sense of self and bound me to him through fear, influencing what I wore and who I saw. I also found it very difficult to say no to sex with him. My decision to have an affair was an act of rebellion. I mulled it over for months before I activated my online dating profile. I finally pushed the button so I could stake a claim to a bit of pleasure that was just for me. Meeting Bharat was liberating. The sex was passionate, but there was no heavy, painful emotion between us. In bed, I held a part of myself aloof from Bharat, and I enjoyed the sense of detachment, because it was the opposite of how swallowed up I felt by my husband. But sometimes with Bharat I felt as if I was play-acting the part of the \u201csexy mistress\u201d who wore nippleless bras and crotchless knickers. The sex we had in bland hotel rooms was exciting, but the excitement sometimes felt a bit cheap. I left my husband a year after meeting Bharat. The affair helped me end my marriage, because it gave me a taste of autonomy, but I had no intention of converting what I had with Bharat into a serious relationship. When Bharat left his wife, I worried about his life as a serial shagger. Part of what persuaded me to give it a go was his total transparency. He went to therapy, and told me about previous flings in such gory detail that I was convinced he had nothing to hide. The first time he said \u201cI love you\u201d my initial self-protective reaction was to blurt out: \u201cI don\u2019t love you.\u201d I was fearful of losing myself in another relationship, but I did love him. One unexpected consequence of making our relationship official is that the sex has actually got better. I bring my whole self to the bedroom now. It\u2019s more sensuous. I\u2019ve hung up my crotchless knickers, and that\u2019s a relief.

She adds that there was no light pollution. Everyone, from her children to her grandchildren, enjoyed the water. Clark is a proponent of multigenerational holidays, where different generations of one family go away together. In a poll of 2,000 British adults, more than half of those surveyed (56%) said they regretted not spending more time with grandparents and 54% said they hoped to bring them on future holidays. EasyJet\u2019s holiday wing is now offering \u201cgrans go free\u201d places on trips to Europe, after research found half of UK families had never holidayed abroad with their grandparents. Clark says that these holidays can be illuminating. She went to Cornwall with her three children, their partners and her three grandchildren for her birthday and learned a lot about her relatives. \u201cWe got to spend more time with my daughter\u2019s girlfriend. When they met, they lived in Amsterdam, and we had never spent a whole week with her. It was so lovely,\u201d Clark says. \u201cBeing with her was revealing. We learned more about our children\u2019s partners\u2019 politics, the books they had read and their feelings about climate change and the world. We had lively discussions and also boring nights where we sat and chilled out with wine and the TV. We watched some great films. I never realised what a massive fan of Harry Potter my daughter\u2019s partner was.\u201d Clark and her family rented out a big house with four bathrooms, one big lounge and a large dining room. \u201cWe could spread out as well \u2026 it was a treat as it was for my 60th birthday,\u201d she says. One downside, Clark says, however, is the cost. They had to travel in school holidays because of the children, which is much more expensive, so saving up for another big family trip will take time. To keep harmony, Clark suggests ensuring each guest has their own bathroom. \u201cWe also ate together every day and then planned what we would do the following day during dinner. I recommend daily communal eating,\u201d she says, adding that each couple cooked for everyone one night of the week. Annalisa Barbieri, who offers relationship advice in her Guardian column, says her main advice on multigenerational holidays is \u201cdon\u2019t go unless you\u2019re sure\u201d. She adds: \u201cThere\u2019s also nothing like finding out about family when you go on holiday, because seeing someone over a 24-hour period is very illuminating. \u201cIf you tend to be the responsible one, then the chances are you will end up organising everything as people look to you. If you are the only one who speaks a foreign language you will be the de facto translator (this happens to me). Ditto if you are the only driver or the one who doesn\u2019t drink \u2013 you will end up doing the driving after meals out.\u201d Barbieri suggests thinking about what you want to achieve on holiday. \u201cAre some of you late risers? If so, then maybe you need to split the groups so that some of you go out early. I am an early riser and it drives me nuts waiting for everyone to get ready and by the time we get out, everything is super busy.\u201d She adds that she \u201cwould always suggest a separate space if possible so you can retreat to your own space\u201d. This includes staying in a hotel \u201cso that someone else is \u2018in charge\u2019 \u2013 someone else decides when breakfast for example, ie the hotel does! Or adjoining villas or Airbnbs.\u201d She says sharing one big space can lead to tensions. \u201cOne person inevitably does the cooking or cleaning if that hasn\u2019t been decided. So set boundaries early.\u201d Perrin Debock, 52, from Paris, said her parents divorced when she was two. For almost a decade she has taken a big trip with either her mother and her partner, or her father and his wife. She says: \u201cFor me, my daughter, now 15 years old, and my husband, these holidays \u2018en famille\u2019 are special because we bond and share the everyday little surprises of travelling.\u201d Last Christmas they went to Egypt for 10 days with her mother\u2019s side. Their next planned holiday will be to Mexico with the other side of the family. \u201cMy daughter is growing up. It is a precious time to share things and moments with her. I know my parents treasure those. Of course, after a week or 10 days, we are happy to each go back home and not hear about them for some time, but those shared transgenerational holidays are great moments to learn from each other. It is a lot of money and planning to please everyone, of course, but definitely worth it. She adds: \u201cThe preparation before, and the pictures after, offer tons of opportunity to bond over things. I know my daughter will always remember those shared holidays.

Other LAC can be left until every applicant of the faith has been admitted. It is true that they would be at the front of the queue of all those who are \u201cnot of the faith\u201d; but in many cases this would still not be enough to secure admission. Alan Parker Former schools adjudicator \u2022 Clifford Longley is correct that many of the UK\u2019s 2,200 Catholic schools are owned by that church, and that some may well have been bought from congregation collection money in the distant past (Letters, 26 January). However, they have for many decades been maintained, refurbished and in some cases replaced wholly at the expense of UK taxpayers, most of whom are not religious at all. Longley claims a government buyout of these and other publicly funded religious schools would be prohibitively expensive. I\u2019d suggest therefore that the government compulsorily purchase them at their economic value for educational use, net of the public capital contributions already made. Who knows, the Catholic church and other religions may in fact owe us something. Damian Murray Leeds \u2022 I am not sure what Juliet Chaplin thinks we should learn from reflecting on the large number of people who have died for their faith (Letters, 26 January), but she might like to also consider the equally large numbers who have been more than happy to kill for their faith.

The top categories are unprecedentedly dominated by women, with only one male artist, Jon Batiste, up for record, album or song of the year. In a week where major research studies in both the US and UK acknowledged progress around representation in a historically male-dominated and often sexist music industry \u2013 while also finding numerous examples of misogyny \u2013 the Grammys are a sign that at female artists, at least, are being celebrated at the highest level. Top of the nominations is the 34-year-old vocalist SZA with nine, following the release of her second studio album, SOS, which topped the US chart, as did its lead single Kill Bill, a deceptively sweet tune carrying a murderous revenge fantasy. Critics thralled to the album\u2019s range \u2013 her core R&amp;B sits alongside hip-hop, folk instrumentation, rowdy rock and more \u2013 and to her often self-lacerating examination of love\u2019s complexity. But the night\u2019s big winner could be Taylor Swift. There\u2019s a sense that industry admiration is behind her following a year in which she dominated pop culture with her album Midnights and the subsequent career-spanning Eras tour \u2013 analysts expect it to make at least $2bn in revenue, over twice as much as the previous highest-grossing tour, by Elton John. Swift is looking to become the first artist to win album of the year four times \u2013 she\u2019s currently tied on three with Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon \u2013 and her track Anti-Hero could earn her first wins in the record and song of the year categories. R&amp;B singer Victoria Mon\u00e9t has seven nominations in her breakthrough year as a solo artist, having previously been nominated as a songwriter for Ariana Grande and Chloe x Halle \u2013 and her two-year-old daughter Hazel, delivering delighted giggles as a featured artist on the song Hollywood, becomes the awards\u2019 youngest ever nominee. Other women with multiple nominations in the top categories are Lana Del Rey, Olivia Rodrigo, Miley Cyrus, Billie Eilish and Boygenius, each with their own particular flavour of heartache and existential angst. If Eilish wins record of the year \u2013 for a third time in five years \u2013 she would have the joint highest number of wins for an artist in that category, alongside Paul Simon and Bruno Mars. Boygenius, the supergroup of indie-rockers Phoebe Bridgers (also up for best pop/duo group performance with SZA), Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus, are up for six awards. They co-produced their debut album with Catherine Marks who has three nominations herself \u2013 but she is the only female producer other than Boygenius, Swift, Eilish and Del Rey listed in the record and album categories, versus 22 men. Marks said the group\u2019s nominations were \u201ckind of mindblowing\u201d, and explained how she tried to create a \u201creally tactile\u201d sound for the album, entitled The Record, made at Rick Rubin\u2019s Shangri-La studio in Malibu. \u201cIt was a beautiful, warm, rich room, which gives the drum tones a lot of power and depth \u2013 we used the room as the fourth identity of The Record,\u201d she said. Marks\u2019s career began 20 years ago when she moved from Australia to London. \u201cI know of stories that are horrendous, but I was lucky with mentors,\u201d she says of being a rare female producer at that time. \u201cThe misogyny I experienced was from other women in the industry, but back then there was a culture of women being pitted against other women, whether consciously or subconsciously. But we now live in a culture where women support other women.\u201d Despite men still dominating production for now \u2013 all five producers in the non-classical category are male \u2013 Marks is heartened by the number of women coming through: \u201cEven in the past year so much has happened.\u201d That diversity, she says, will particularly help young female artists who have otherwise been \u201cworking with old white men \u2013 understandably, their experiences are not shared. Communication could be difficult or they might not feel comfortable enough to express their ideas. So the environment is really important. But there are so many more [producers] to choose from now.\u201d To keep the momentum going, she called for government grants for interns in recording studios: \u201cWe need the next generation to come through, and we want that to be more diverse \u2013 not just gender, but economic, and racial. I hope other people\u2019s road to success is a little more speedy than mine.\u201d She has already got one prize so far this week: the Powerhouse prize at the Resonator awards, celebrating female producers and engineers. It is that ceremony\u2019s debut year \u2013 another sign of a rapidly diversifying industry. The Grammys ceremony, hosted by Trevor Noah at the Crypto.com arena in Los Angeles, will have performances from nominees including SZA, Rodrigo, Eilish and Travis Scott, though two returning legends will probably get the heartiest welcome. Having quit touring and with no new music since 2007, it was once feared that Joni Mitchell\u2019s career was over, especially after she suffered an aneurysm in 2015 that meant she had to learn to walk again. But as she recovered she began a regular series of private jam sessions at her home with luminaries such as Elton John, Paul McCartney and Harry Styles. In July 2022 she took the concept public with an unannounced set at the Newport folk festival, followed in June 2023 by a full return to live performance at the spectacular Gorge Amphitheater in Washington state. She is now performing at the Grammys for the first time, having won nine awards over the years \u2013 though a number of her classic albums such as Blue, Hejira and Ladies of the Canyon were overlooked entirely by the Academy. Billy Joel is also set to perform, likely giving a first public performance of Turn the Lights Back On \u2013 only his second new solo single since 1993. British artists did well at 2023\u2019s awards, with Harry Styles getting album of the year and winning pop categories alongside Adele and Sam Smith, while Wet Leg and Ozzy Osbourne dominated the rock and alternative awards with two wins apiece. This year could be a step down, with Dua Lipa and Fred Again the only British nominees in the \u201cbig four\u201d categories of record, song, album and best new artist, though Fred Again leads a strong showing from the UK\u2019s dance and electronic community: Aphex Twin, the Chemical Brothers, James Blake, Romy and Calvin Harris are nominated alongside him in the genre categories. British producer Mark Ronson has four nominations after he helmed the Barbie soundtrack, which produced a number of hit singles including Dance the Night \u2013 earning Lipa a song of the year nod \u2013 and I\u2019m Just Ken, the ludicrously impassioned power ballad performed by Ryan Gosling. With four nominations, Fred Again \u2013 AKA 30-year-old London-born producer Frederick Gibson \u2013 joins Ronson as the most successful Brit this year, underlining his increasing US fame. An impromptu headline DJ set at California\u2019s Coachella festival last year, with Gibson alongside Skrillex and Four Tet, gobsmacked the crowd and went viral, showcasing his skill for high-intensity emotion and even poignancy amid the banging tempos. Also in 2023 he showcased the quieter end of his craft in a collaborative album with early mentor Brian Eno, and has previously worked behind the scenes with various pop stars including Ed Sheeran, sharing in a song of the year Grammy nomination for Sheeran\u2019s Bad Habits in 2022. This summer he steps up to solo headline status at US festival Bonnaroo and Reading &amp; Leeds in the UK. If Swift wins album of the year the focus will rightly be on her record-breaking achievement, but it will mean her studio engineer Serban Ghenea will actually beat her for the highest number of wins in the category, with five. Ghenea, a Romanian who moved with his family to Canada as a child in 1976, has previously won for Swift\u2019s 1989 and Folklore, plus Adele\u2019s 25 and Bruno Mars\u2019s 24K Magic, and has won 15 Grammys in other categories thanks to work dating back to Justin Timberlake\u2019s 2002 debut album. His work on another album of the year nominee, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Guts, gives him another chance to claim the all-time record.", "date": "2024-02-02", "section": "Music", "author": "Ben Beaumont-Thomas", "id": 346, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/112f7ea9a19b03aa7e5ffbafc03da9644343a56d/0_217_6192_3715/500.jpg"}, {"title": "I\u2019m longing to return to the place we used to live.

Or should I take one last leap of faith? I\u2019m worried that perhaps I\u2019m repeating a pattern by leaving again, but equally, I worry that it\u2019s foolish not to move back to the place I love. You titled your letter \u201cAm I repeating a pattern by leaving again?\u201d and it\u2019s interesting you\u2019ve seen there is one. Patterns can be useful pathfinders, or they can be grooves we get stuck in and don\u2019t have the knowledge or confidence to get out of. There were a few unknowns and you didn\u2019t mention any actual places, thus I don\u2019t know if the place you\u2019re in now offers more long-term possibilities than the last one, or how permanent either of those places is. I contacted UKCP psychotherapist Mark Vahrmeyer, no stranger to moving around a lot himself in a previous life (we did a podcast on belonging which you may find interesting). What struck us is how you hoped where you live now would become permanent but then you disliked it so much you made it your \u201cmission to leave\u201d but now having a chance to leave, you\u2019re not sure. Vahrmeyer picked up on how leaving the place you were before, in such a rush, must have been a shock for you. \u201cAlso,\u201d said Vahrmeyer, \u201cI didn\u2019t get much of a sense of your desire, your appetite, what you wanted. Perhaps following your husband\u2019s career provided the excitement, the purveyor of all the adventure?\u201d Was the place you\u2019re in now where you had children, or did you have them before the move? I wonder if either having children, or them getting older and perhaps their needs becoming more obvious, has given you a chance to re-evaluate what\u2019s important to you all as a family. You mention this place being \u201cgood enough\u201d. Being good enough is rather undervalued as a benchmark in the search for the perfect. That said, no one should remain unhappy if they have a chance to change it. \u201cYou say your children are settled,\u201d said Vahrmeyer \u201cand that\u2019s a really good thing, children need stability. Perhaps that\u2019s something to think about alongside what you and your husband want. Maybe you\u2019ve changed and you\u2019re settled [more than you realise?].\u201d \u201cI wonder if the last place,\u201d suggested Vahrmeyer, has become slightly idealised? You were there for such a short time. Was life in general more exciting then?\u201d Are you able to go back to the place you were for a visit, to see how you feel in reality and not fantasy? Nowhere is perfect but it\u2019s about \u201cbeing able to accept disappointment and limitations but still find substance in a place or a person,\u201d said Vahrmeyer. He also wanted you to think about if it\u2019s the \u201cplace that\u2019s making you miserable or the permanence? Is it where you\u2019re living now you find miserable or is it something around the idea of putting down roots?\u201d I also want you to practise an exercise I tried myself over Christmas. I was feeling a little overwhelmed by life, and looked back at my bachelor girl flat with some sentiment. So I really imagined myself there, but as I am now. I went through all the things I like to do now and imagined myself doing them back there. And I realised that neither my parents nor my friends would be round the corner any longer. So much has changed, internally for me, and externally in the place. I saw that what I had now was not only really appealing but I realised I\u2019d made my life the way it was on purpose. I wonder if you could do such an exercise? This may help you really zone in on what actually matters to you now. \u2022 Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Named for the under-foot sound of its quartz sand, the Wilson\u2019s Promontory beach is close to the most southerly point of mainland Australia. It becomes the first Victorian beach to top Tourism Australia\u2019s annual list, which celebrates the country\u2019s diversity and some of its lesser-known coastal spots, with The Farm \u2013 also known as Killalea beach \u2013 in Shellharbour, New South Wales, taking second place. Tasmania\u2019s Cockle Creek, Australia\u2019s southernmost beach, was third. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Coastal veteran and former beach ambassador, Brad Farmer, had the \u201ctough, sometimes controversial job\u201d of selecting the final 10 from all 11,761 Australian beaches. Adjunct fellow in tourism and management at the University of Technology of Sydney, David Beirman, said he did not envy the judge, given Australia\u2019s plethora of beaches. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to pick a winner. Whether it\u2019s the longest beach or the best beach or the softest beach or the cleanest beach, we\u2019re embarrassed for choice in that area,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Squeaky beach \u2013 albeit many years ago \u2013 and it did squeak. It\u2019s a fantastic beach. I guess one could argue whether it\u2019s Australia\u2019s best beach. \u201cAs a tourism body, you try and encourage dispersion. This fits the bill, it\u2019s in relatively easy reach from Melbourne and yet it\u2019s very pristine. There are places outside St Kilda beach or Bondi or Manly that are terrific.\u201d He said that accessibility, cleanliness, wildlife, safety and beauty were only some of a range of factors that Farmer would have considered in his selection process. Farmer said the Tourism Australia list was a \u201cchance to uncover some of those destinations that might not be well known but are home to some of Australia\u2019s, and in my opinion the world\u2019s, best beaches\u201d. Madfish Bay in Western Australia was fourth on the list and in fifth place was Cocos Islands\u2019 Pulu Blan Madar island, a crescent of palm-fringed sand surrounded by a 467,054km-square marine sanctuary and part of Australia\u2019s most remote territory. \u201cThe year\u2019s list includes at least one beach from each state, the Northern Territory and even an Australian external territory, which is well off the coast of Australia, but the search for best beaches extends far and wide and one island on the far-flung archipelago caught my eye,\u201d Farmer said. The federal tourism minister, Don Farrell, said \u201cAustralia\u2019s beaches are the best in the world,\u201d while Tourism Australia managing director, Phillipa Harrison, said that the \u201cmajority\u201d of visitors to Australia spend time in the aquatic environment while travelling. Farmer said Australian beaches were \u201cmuch more than just a place to lay a towel and get wet\u201d. \u201cOur coasts have the potential to become this nation\u2019s greatest sustainable resource for generations to come\u201d.

Nice conversation and lots of laughs over delicious food and drinks. First impressions? Friendly, funny, interesting. What did you talk about? Being single parents. Places we\u2019ve been. How our jobs keep us passionate. What we read. Living in Australia as expats. How many best friends she has! Most awkward moment? Maybe when she joked that she was leaving because I haven\u2019t taught my daughter to speak Spanish. Good table manners? Great \u2013 she dealt with the potentially tricky (and gigantic) lobster. Best thing about Marjo? How easy it was talking to her about any topic. No awkward moments. Definitely a people person. Would you introduce Marjo to your friends? 100% yes. Describe Marjo in three words. Friendly, smart, fun. What do you think Marjo made of you? That I was funny (I hope!), a good listener and a good dad. Did you go on anywhere? To the train station. And \u2026 did you kiss? On the cheek, when we met. Hopefully that didn\u2019t seem too forward. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? Not much. Maybe going out on a Saturday would have been slightly more relaxing for both of us. Marks out of 10? 9. Only because of the assumption that 10 is a date that leads to something after. Otherwise: beautiful person, excellent date. Would you meet again? Of course, I\u2019m very happy to keep in touch with the kind, fun and interesting people of this world. Marjo on Edwin What were you hoping for? To meet someone interesting in a new way, a tasty meal and good conversation. First impressions? Laughs from the start. We made some jokes with the waiting staff about our accents, and whether we could all understand each other. What did you talk about? A bit of everything. Changing jobs. Moving to Australia. Kids. The menu. Most awkward moment? It was getting late and I had to collect my son, so I may have rushed the dessert course a bit. Good table manners? Excellent. Best thing about Edwin? Really friendly and easy to chat with. The time passed quickly. Would you introduce Edwin to your friends? It\u2019d be fun to do a Latin dance night with him and the mates \u2013 he could no doubt teach us a thing or two. Describe Edwin in three words. Thoughtful, warm, worldly. What do you think Edwin made of you? Hopefully friendly and talkative. I\u2019d accidentally skipped lunch, so hungry, too \u2013 I was quick to order for the both of us. Did you go on somewhere? We walked to the station together and then I hailed a taxi \u2013 it was quite late. And \u2026 did you kiss? On the cheek. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? Not having to rush dessert. Marks out of 10? This is tough one. We had a great time and Edwin was lovely, but there was no romantic connection, so I\u2019m going to say 8. Would you meet again?

Last year, retirement advisers at Just Group found that eight in 10 pensioner households eligible to claim benefits were failing to do so \u2013 and missing out on an average of \u00a31,231 a year as a result. Pension credit and council tax reductions were among the unclaimed benefits on its list. Other organisations such as the charity Turn2us say benefits such as the personal independence payment are also overlooked. Then there are tax perks you may be entitled to, prizes you never claimed, and cash in accounts that may have gone astray. So what money may have your name on it? Unclaimed premium bond prizes A total of \u00a381m in premium bond prizes is waiting to be collected. The 2,358,553 unclaimed prizes include six \u00a3100,000 wins, one of which is registered to a bondholder with an Australian address, says the website Savings Champion. They include what could well be the UK\u2019s oldest unclaimed prizes: some \u00a325 wins dating back to 1957. A prize that remains uncashed for 18 months is classed as unclaimed. There is no time limit for claiming a premium bond win \u2013 each prize is held until the rightful owner can be tracked down. Some of these winners may be dead, though. If someone has died, the prize would go to their estate. In many cases the unclaimed prizes have been left sitting in National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I)\u2019s system because the winners have moved house and failed to provide their new address. Some people may have forgotten they even had premium bonds. You can easily check if you have an unclaimed win by using NS&amp;I\u2019s online prize checker or its prize checker app. You will need to know your numbers \u2013 they will be on any letter you have about your account. To trace any lost bonds that you do not have numbers for, you will need to contact NS&amp;I. It has a tracing service you can use. Once you are reunited with your holdings, you can set up to receive prizes directly into your bank account. Lost savings accounts There are more than 150m bank and building society accounts in the UK, and inevitably, some end up getting lost and becoming dormant. This is where an account has been inactive for a long time \u2013 often 15 years \u2013 and the bank, building society or NS&amp;I writes to the customer but no response is received. Luckily, there is a free service called My Lost Account \u2013 at mylostaccount.org.uk \u2013 that can help you trace this money. It brings together the tracing schemes of the banking body UK Finance, the Building Societies Association and NS&amp;I into a single website, so you only need to fill in one application form. The service is aimed at people who are unsure which institution holds their account \u2013 including instances where the bank or building society may have closed or merged with another. Information provided via the online application form is passed to the institutions that may be holding the lost account. They will then carry out a search of their lost accounts. If you know the name of the bank or building society with which you held the account, and that institution still exists, then it\u2019s best to start by contacting them directly. The marriage allowance This is an often-overlooked tax break that applies to couples where one earns less than the personal allowance \u2013 normally \u00a312,570. The lower earner can transfer up to \u00a31,260 of their personal allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner who is earning more than that and therefore paying tax. It only applies if the higher earner is not a higher-rate taxpayer. The transfer reduces the recipient\u2019s tax by up to \u00a3252 a year currently. This is typically done by changing their tax code. The person with the lower income can apply online. It\u2019s free, and they will get an email confirming their application within 24 hours. They can also do it via the self-assessment system (assuming they are already registered and send in a tax return) or by filling in the form MATCF and sending it to the address on the form. Individuals can backdate their claim to include any tax year since 5 April 2019 that they were eligible. Their partner\u2019s tax bill will be reduced depending on the personal allowance rate for the relevant years. Child trust fund cash Child trust funds (CTFs) \u2013 dubbed \u201cbaby bonds\u201d \u2013 were a big deal: more than 6.3m were opened between their launch in 2005 and 2011 when they were scrapped, and billions of pounds are locked up in them. But a lot of these accounts have been forgotten about, which means that for many young people, there is a pot of cash out there that they are unaware of. When children turn 18, they can access their money. The first payouts were made in 2020, and the windfalls will run all the way through until January 2029. If a child\u2019s parents or guardian failed to open a CTF account within a year, HM Revenue and Customs opened one on their behalf. At least 1.7m \u201cRevenue-allocated\u201d accounts were opened. On top of that, some parents will have forgotten about their child\u2019s fund and maybe moved house. Last year MPs were told there may be more than 900,000 unclaimed CTFs with in excess of \u00a31.7bn in them. The Share Foundation, a charity, has been working with the government to help young people find their accounts, and runs a free-to-use search service. Go to findctf.sharefound.org and you will find a simple form you can fill in. HMRC has also created an online tool to help young people find out where their account is held. Attendance allowance The name of this benefit probably doesn\u2019t help take-up \u2013 it\u2019s not clear at first glance who or what it is for. In a nutshell, it is money to help you pay for care if you have reached state pension age and you have an illness or disability that means you need that support. An award of attendance allowance can be worth up to \u00a35,306 a year. In December, a report by the company Policy in Practice and MoneySavingExpert.com claimed that 1.1 million pension-age households could be missing out on \u00a35.2bn of attendance allowance each year. To qualify, you must have needed help or supervision for at least six months \u2013 unless you are terminally ill, in which case you do not have to wait. It is not means-tested, it doesn\u2019t matter if you live alone or with other people and no one checks what you spend it on. It is also tax-free. You can still get it if you live in a care home and pay the home costs yourself. It\u2019s paid weekly, and there are two rates: one if you need help during either the daytime or at night, and one if you need help in both. These rates are currently \u00a368.10 and \u00a3101.75 respectively. You can claim by printing off and filling in a form, or phone the dedicated helpline (0800 731 0122) to request a copy. Citizens Advice says it is best to phone because your payments will be backdated to the date you phoned. You may have to undergo an assessment to check your eligibility if it\u2019s unclear how your illness or disability affects you. Child benefit The high income child benefit charge \u2013 a tax penalty that hits parents earning more than \u00a350,000 a year \u2013 has been around for more than 10 years now. As of August 2022, more than 680,000 families with one or more higher earners had opted out of receiving child benefit in order to avoid being hit by the charge. However, some of those affected will have subsequently lost their job, reduced their hours or taken a pay cut, and as a result are no longer earning \u00a350,000-plus. If you have previously opted out but now earn less, make sure you restart your child benefit payments (assuming you still qualify). Child benefit is worth \u00a324 a week \u2013 or \u00a31,248 a year \u2013 for the oldest or only child. The rate for each additional child is \u00a315.90 a week, or almost \u00a3827 a year. You can reapply by filling in an online form (you need a Government Gateway user ID and password), or by contacting the child benefit office. You can do this online, by phone (0300 200 3100) or by post. Incidentally, new parents can now claim child benefit online for the first time since it was launched, and no longer have to wait up to 16 weeks for their first payment. The new claims process on Gov.uk takes about 10 minutes, with payments made in as little as three days. Council tax discount There are several reasons why you may qualify for a discount on your council tax: it could be that you are on a low income, or that you live alone, or that you share the property with someone who does not have to pay. If you are the only adult in your home, you will get a 25% discount on your council tax bill. When working out how many people live in a property, some aren\u2019t counted \u2013 they are called \u201cdisregarded\u201d people, explains Citizens Advice. That may include a young person, a student or a live-in carer. You may also get a discount if your partner is in a care home long term. The charity\u2019s website has full details. If you are on a low income or claim benefits, you may be eligible for council tax reduction. Contact your council to apply for a reduction. Pension credit One benefit that a lot of people don\u2019t claim is pension credit. This gives people extra money to help with living costs if they are over state pension age and on a low income. It can also help with some housing costs. It tops up your weekly income to \u00a3201.05 if you are single, or your joint weekly income to \u00a3306.85 if you have a partner, and you may be able to get extra sums on top if you have other responsibilities or costs. The government\u2019s figures show that in the 2019-20 financial year up to \u00a31.7bn of available pension credit went unclaimed. On average that added up to about \u00a31,900 a year for each of the up to 850,000 families entitled to receive it who \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 didn\u2019t claim. To find out if you are eligible and how much you could get, use the government\u2019s pension credit calculator. You can apply online, by phone (0800 99 1234) or by post. Bereavement support You may be able to get bereavement support payment if you have lost a partner. The Gov.uk website outlines the eligibility, how much you might be able to get and how to apply (you can do it online, by phone or by post). If this does apply to you, a crucial date is only a few days away. Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, says that if you are unmarried, have children and your partner died between 9 April 2001 and 8 February 2023, you can possibly claim up to \u00a340,000 of backdated bereavement support, but only until 8 February this year. (The deadline relates to a law change after a court ruling.) Lewis says that if you are unsure if you qualify, \u201cjust do it! The deadline\u2019s so close, cross [your] fingers and apply.\u201d Help that is available \u2022 Entitledto: the website entitledto.co.uk has a calculator you can use to see if you qualify for any state benefits. You need to answer questions about your household situation and your income, and it presents a list of any payments you may be entitled to. For each one it offers information and details of how to make a claim. \u2022 Turn2us: the charity also offers a calculator, at benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk. You will need the same details to answer its questions. At the end it also presents a list of benefits you may qualify for, plus links to the sites you will need to go to if you want to start a claim. Turn2us also has a \u201cgrants search\u201d tool where you can find out if you could get help from charitable grants. \u2022 Citizens Advice: the website citizensadvice.org.uk has information on benefits and a calculator. The charity also offers help via the phone or in person. You can search for your local office online, or call the adviceline on 0800 144 8848 in England or 0800 702 2020 in Wales. \u2022 Age UK: the charity offers various services including an advice line (0800 678 1602) that can help with things such as finding out about benefits you could claim and how to go about doing that.", "date": "2024-02-03", "section": "Money", "author": "Rupert Jones and Hilary Osborne", "id": 350, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cd56fa94430a6363f6f616801bbba2e2387905dc/0_68_8192_4918/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Sarah Greene looks back: \u2018I took my role as the Virgin Mary incredibly seriously\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/03/sarah-greene-looks-back-i-took-my-role-as-the-virgin-mary-incredibly-seriously", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.108, "neu": 0.678, "pos": 0.215, "compound": 0.9977}, "body": "Born and raised in Cork, in the south-west of Ireland, the theatre, film and television actor Sarah Greene was just six years old when she first stepped on stage, performing in local musical theatre and pantomimes. She later attended Cada Performing Arts school in Cork and then the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin, from which she graduated in 2006. Greene\u2019s interpretation of Helen in Martin McDonagh\u2019s The Cripple of Inishmaan in 2013 earned her Olivier and Tony award nominations, while her screen credits include Bad Sisters, Normal People, Vikings and Dublin Murders. Now 39, she lives in London and Belfast with her partner and son. Greene is currently starring in Sexy Beast on Paramount+. When I was five years old, I was cast as the Virgin Mary in the infants\u2019 school nativity play. With my blue cape and stern expression, I took the role incredibly seriously. I was very much in character as a committed mother. I actually still have that Tiny Tears doll at my family home in Cork, although she\u2019s missing a lot of hair. When I wasn\u2019t performing, I liked to give her locks a chop. Particularly the fringe. The following year, it was decided that the school would give another child a chance at Mary. The teachers thought it would be a good idea to pull the name of the next girl to play the role out of a hat. When they did that, it was Sarah Greene, yet again. I was Mary two years in a row, much to the disdain of some of the other girls\u2019 mothers. It was a real drama, a proper controversy. Even though I was young, I had already realised that acting was my ambition. Around this time, my parents had got me tickets in the dress circle to see Cinderella at Cork opera house, and while I was watching it, all I could think about was how I longed to be with the actors on stage. You wouldn\u2019t have guessed it to meet me back then; I was very quiet and super shy, far from an extrovert. I found interactions with people I didn\u2019t know agonising. I have memories of my mum asking me to go into the supermarket on my own and absolutely hating it. Acting helped my confidence grow. What I loved most was putting on masks and being able to express myself through other characters. At the age of six, I entered a talent competition. My solo performance was Miss Hannigan in Annie and I really threw myself into it \u2013 walking around the stage holding an empty bottle of vodka and wearing my mum\u2019s high heels. Everyone was terrified I would trip up and break my ankles, but I adored pretending to be this drunk woman singing Little Girls. I came second and it was all the encouragement I needed to know this was the life for me. Being on stage was where I felt my best self. My childhood was very outdoorsy: running around the fields and woods that surrounded the old farmhouse I grew up in. When my parents originally bought it they had no intention of becoming farmers, but they inherited lots of potbellied pigs, cats and dogs from the previous owner \u2013 chickens, too. We didn\u2019t even eat their eggs as we considered them our pets. It was all very wholesome. My mum was a stay-at-home mother and my dad worked in telecommunications, and still does. Even though acting was an unknown profession to them, they were unbelievably supportive, especially as there were a few teachers who would complain because I was missing so much school \u2013 although I wasn\u2019t lagging behind. From a very young age I was driven, and my parents encouraged me at every step because they were so relieved I\u2019d found something I was passionate about. I\u2019ve made sure they have always come along for the ride \u2013 they have joined me at awards shows and when I\u2019ve been performing in New York and filming in France. They have been there for the less glamorous jobs, too. I remember my dad coming to see me when I was in a not very good play in Dublin. At the end, he was the only person giving a standing ovation. Afterwards, I said: \u201cOh no! Dad, you didn\u2019t need to stand.\u201d He said: \u201cI\u2019ve always stood, and I always will stand for you.\u201d I had worked for years in Irish theatre, and had done a couple of films along the way, but it wasn\u2019t until The Cripple of Inishmaan that film and TV really opened their doors to me. The Tony nomination put me on the map. I was up against some phenomenal talent, so I wasn\u2019t worried that I would have to get up on the platform and give a speech, but it was a brilliant and surreal night \u2013 and something that totally changed the course of my career. It wasn\u2019t always easy. The first time I remember being rejected by a production and feeling hurt was when I was 10. I had auditioned for the Cork Operatic Society\u2019s production of The Sound of Music, and had to sing Happy Birthday \u2013 which is actually a really hard song to sing. I didn\u2019t get it, and was heartbroken. Devastated. My parents said: \u201cIf this is the job you want to do, you\u2019re going to have to get used to that.\u201d There are still times when I\u2019m quite sad about not getting a role, but I\u2019ve since come to realise that it\u2019s often nothing to do with your talent \u2013 it\u2019s what you look like, your height or something fundamental that is completely out of your hands. When it comes to surviving the entertainment industry as a woman today, it certainly feels like the landscape is changing for the better. I\u2019ve been fortunate to be consistently surrounded by inspirational women throughout my career: when I was doing panto and plays as a child, I was performing with a lot of female actors from different generations, who taught me so many skills and opened me up socially. I became a mum a few years ago and it has definitely exposed me to new emotions. However, before I had my son, I\u2019d already explored maternal roles: first as Rosie in the 2018 film of the same name; and then as Lorraine in Normal People. I was on set on the first day of filming Normal People, and from the opening scene I realised that Paul [Mescal] and Daisy [Edgar-Jones] were electric and that we were in the presence of something great. Quite rightly, they have since become superstars, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want their level of fame. I like to be able to sit in a restaurant, eat some food, and for no one to look at me. I want to be able to have a conversation and not feel like I am being eavesdropped on. The older I get, the more I just want to do my job, come home, see my little boy and try to get him to bed. I don\u2019t put up with crap any more. I\u2019m very capable of speaking my mind if I think something\u2019s not right, which I didn\u2019t do so much when I was younger, as I was scared to rock the boat and lose the job. Not that I have much cause to speak out at the moment \u2013 I\u2019m in the middle of shooting the new series of Bad Sisters, so I\u2019m surrounded by incredibly powerful, smart, supportive women every day on set. From our lord and saviour Sharon Horgan, the genius that she is, to its directors and producers, the whole show is female-led, which I find really sexy and exciting. While I care less what people think of me, I am, and always have been, a bit of a people-pleaser. When I look at this photo, I see a little girl who wants to be someone\u2019s best friend. I\u2019d love to go back and give her a hug, and tell her life\u2019s going to be cool and that even though it sometimes feels like she\u2019s the shyest kid in the room, she\u2019s not so quiet any more.", "date": "2024-02-03", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Harriet Gibsone", "id": 351, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e88864883ccc64c96e85f8ec3561c9367cf5db26/633_544_1331_798/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Wayne Kramer: a complex and influential musician, dogged by lucklessness", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/03/wayne-kramer-mc5-complex-and-influential-musician-dogged-by-lucklessness", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.113, "neu": 0.686, "pos": 0.201, "compound": 0.9984}, "body": "Wayne Kramer used to tell a remarkable story about the first time he realised how influential his music had become. It was 1976, and he read an article in Billboard magazine about the Ramones and the burgeoning New York punk scene, which \u201ckept saying that these kind of bands were inspired by the MC5\u201d. Kramer was so horrified, he tore the magazine up and flushed it down the nearest toilet. He was in a federal prison in Kentucky, serving a four-year sentence for drug offences and, as he put it, \u201cfrom where I was sat, \u2018punk\u2019 did not have a good ring to it\u201d. \u201cIn jail, a punk is somebody that they knock down and make their girlfriend, you know: \u2018I\u2019m gonna make you my punk\u2019,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat kind of talk could get you killed, right?\u201d It\u2019s a story that tells you a great deal, both about the MC5\u2019s importance and the lucklessness that dogged their career. The three albums they made between 1969 and 1971 were indeed set texts for aspiring punk bands and continued to reverberate through rock music. When Kramer reconvened the three surviving members of the MC5 in the 21st century, he was swamped by musicians wanting to fill in for their late vocalist Rob Tyner and guitarist Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith: Lemmy, Don Was, the Cult\u2019s Ian Astbury and Dave Vanian of the Damned all performed, as did members of Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Fugazi, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Faith No More, Pearl Jam and progressive metal pioneers King\u2019s X. But for all the undoubted brilliance of their albums, the MC5\u2019s actual career often resembled a band lurching from one disaster to the next \u2013 hype, mediocre sales, wounding battles with record companies, retailers and gig promoters, hard drugs \u2013 and, by the time of their split, Kramer was more or less destitute: broke and addicted to heroin, he became a petty criminal and drug dealer, hence the prison sentence. A number of the band\u2019s problems stemmed from a revolutionary political stance, which it wasn\u2019t even clear that the members actually believed in. Kramer claimed the band only glommed on to political activist John Sinclair, who became their manager, \u201cbecause we started to see the hippy thing was gonna be big \u2026 we figured the way to get hippies to like us was to get the chief hippy to like us, who was John Sinclair\u201d, and that their own politics extended little further than \u201cnot wanting to get up in the morning and have a real job\u201d. But if their commitment to actually overthrowing The Man was questionable at best, the MC5\u2019s music brooked little argument. Kramer liked to note that the first gig he ever saw was Del Shannon performing at a Detroit drag strip, and that he felt there was little difference between rock\u2019n\u2019roll and the sound of drag racers: \u201cloud and fast, just like the music\u201d. That kind of thinking certainly informed one aspect of his playing \u2013 on the MC5\u2019s legendary debut album Kick Out the Jams, Kramer\u2019s guitar is frantic and distorted and stinging: as one critic noted, he often seems to be flaying the guitar as much as playing it \u2013 but Kramer was always a more complex musician than the proto-punk tag allows for. He was a jazz fan, alive to the startling developments that were taking place in the music of John Coltrane and Sun Ra in the mid-60s. The MC5 might have initially presented themselves as the archetypical American garage rock band \u2013 their debut single was a cover of Them\u2019s I Can Only Give You Everything, a staple of garage bands the country over \u2013 but Kramer was already attempting to work his love of free jazz into their music: there was an edge of atonality and barely controlled chaos to his playing on their second single Looking At You; the early MC5 were as likely to hit audiences with the lengthy Black to Comm, on which a tough riff shades into free improvisation, as they were to play covers of I\u2019m a Man or Baby Please Don\u2019t Go. By the time Kick Out the Jams was recorded, live at Detroit\u2019s Grande Ballroom in December 1968, their sound had become denser and heavier \u2013 the title track boasts one of the all-time-great hard rock riffs; the sludgy I Want You Right Now sounds like the MC5 are engaged in inventing grunge 20 years too early \u2013 but the free jazz influence remained, most obviously on the closing Starship, based on a poem by Sun Ra, strafed by bursts of improvised noise. It was an extraordinary, incendiary debut, but its release was scuppered both by battles with retailers over the word \u201cmotherfucker\u201d appearing in the lyrics and John Sinclair\u2019s liner notes \u2013 which ultimately led to them being dropped by their label \u2013 and by what you might call the MC5\u2019s strained relationship with the revolutionary stance the album occasionally espoused. The MC5 had got a lot of countercultural kudos for being the only band to play for the demonstrators outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, but when they arrived at a 1969 New York gig in a limousine, the radical hippy audience denounced them as traitors, rioted and smashed their equipment up, leading promoter Bill Graham to blackball the band. By the time of their second album, 1970\u2019s Back in the USA, they had been expelled from Sinclair\u2019s White Panther party for \u201ccounter-revolutionary ideals\u201d \u2013 the band members had spent part of their advance from their new label Atlantic on a sports car each \u2013 which you rather got the impression came as a relief. Certainly, the album significantly dialled down the lyrical politicking, as well as trying to make the band sound more approachable: shorter songs, less improvisation, a couple of old rock\u2019n\u2019roll covers, a ballad. The material was often great \u2013 Shakin\u2019 Street, Tonight, Let Me Try \u2013 as was Kramer\u2019s guitar playing, which was particularly fantastic on The Human Being Lawnmower, and it might have worked were it not for an abysmal production job, which left them sounding tinny and weedy, as if the whole thing were coming out of a tiny transistor radio. The following year\u2019s High Time was a vast improvement. Kramer often opined that it was the MC5\u2019s best album; certainly it was their broadest in scope, balancing hard-driving rock\u2019n\u2019roll, as on Sister Anne, with anarchic experimentation \u2013 the closing Skunk (Sonically Speaking) was their most clearly jazz-indebted piece yet, complete with a horn section \u2013 and Kramer\u2019s Miss X, a kind of epic rock ballad that potentially pointed towards a fresh musical direction in the future. But, as it turned out, there was no future. The album flopped, the drug problems increased and the MC5 broke up in 1972: only a few dozen people turned up to their farewell gig at the Grande Ballroom, the same venue they had packed out for the recording of Kick Out the Jams, and Kramer fled the stage, distraught, before the end. You might have expected punk to reinvigorate Wayne Kramer\u2019s career, but it didn\u2019t quite work out that way. He liked to suggest that his time in prison improved his guitar playing \u2013 he encountered jazz trumpeter, former Charlie Parker sideman and fellow junkie Red Rodney behind bars, who gave him lessons in improvisation \u2013 and he played an integral role on Was (Not Was)\u2019s eponymous 1981 debut album, his guitar sprawling magnificently over the dancefloor rhythms of Wheel Me Out and Tell Me I\u2019m Dreaming, but he was still struggling with drugs. Under the circumstances, attempting to form a band with rock\u2019s most unrepentant junkie Johnny Thunders probably wasn\u2019t such a hot idea: the rough live recordings that exist of Gang War have their adherents, and the Kramer-sung cover of Jimmy Cliff\u2019s The Harder They Come is genuinely impressive, imbued with a rueful power, but the whole thing fell apart before they recorded a single original song. Kramer spent the rest of the 80s working as a carpenter, playing only intermittently. His solo career only really kicked off with 1995\u2019s The Hard Stuff, the first of a series of impressive, but overlooked albums he recorded for punk label Epitaph: they offered a more straightforward brand of hard rock than the MC5 had at their peak, but the songs were strong, the lyrics unflinching in their portrayal of addiction \u2013 listen to Junkie Romance or It\u2019s Never Enough, from 1996\u2019s Dangerous Madness \u2013 and Kramer\u2019s guitar never failed to wail thrillingly. Citizen Wayne released in 1997 is probably the best of the lot: produced by Don Was, it offered an autobiographical suite of songs that shifted him out of his latter-day comfort zone into more experimental electronic territory, a brave gamble that paid off on the idiosyncratic Dope For Democracy and Count Time. He spent most of the 21st century consumed by various warmly received MC5 reunions and, increasingly, advocacy: he became involved with charities that dealt with drug addiction and fronted the American wing of Billy Bragg\u2019s Jail Guitar Doors, which provided musical equipment to prisoners as a means of rehabilitation. He published a brutally honest autobiography and, catalysed by the Trump presidency \u2013 \u201che gave permission for every asshole in the world to be assholes\u201d \u2013 started work on a new MC5 album. He could be winningly indifferent about the band\u2019s legacy, finding fault with every album they released (even Kick Out the Jams, he suggested, \u201cdidn\u2019t catch us on a particularly great night\u201d) and dismissive of the music they continued to inspire, claiming most of it missed their experimental side that he \u201ccould hear more original things in hip-hop\u201d. But you suspected that Wayne Kramer knew exactly how powerful the MC5 had been, and that their music would always be a galvanising force for anyone interested in making raucous, exploratory, righteously pissed-off but euphoric rock\u2019n\u2019roll, whatever he thought of the results. \u201cThe band always represented an unlimited sense of possibilities and action,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2022. \u201cWe were talking about kicking out the jams, not handing out the jams or thinking about the jams. We were talking about taking action.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2024.

I was with three travel-weary friends who were hitchhiking to a small fishing village for an epic reunion of travellers who had met at Oktoberfest in Munich the month before and had agreed to meet up again in Calpe. As we stood under the Spanish sun, a black car pulled up. Inside was this strangely dressed guy in a beach hat with a charming smile. He asked where we were headed and when we mentioned the reunion, he said: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Philip. Hop in, I\u2019m heading there too.\u201d There were three villas where all the travellers were staying \u2013 an American villa (where I was lodged with my London friends), a Canadian villa and an Australian villa. Needless to say the Aussie villa was the wildest and most fun. Life in Calpe was picnic excursions to the countryside, beach volleyball, dinners at various villas and some very wild parties. I remember at one such gathering, Philip and a friend went to the local bodega and spent all our contributions on as much alcohol as they could find. That evening, they mixed up a giant tub of sangria with every form of alcohol imaginable, topped off with some chunks of fruit. I remember remarking that it looked potent; they said it was \u201cjust a fruit drink\u201d. By dawn, there were bodies collapsed on the lawn, people honking into bushes and heaving out of windows. Some fruit drink! At first I thought Philip was an unusual guy. He wore shoes that were too big and flipped open at the end so his toes hung out, and a long, oversized coat. One night at a party at the Australian villa, I was reading palms when Philip flicked his open hand over my shoulder and said, \u201cRead mine, Rhodesiac\u201d (I was from Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe.) He was wearing his striped towelling hat and flamboyant pink board shorts covered in fish (his mum made them from old curtains). As I held his hand in mine, it felt strong but gentle and safe. He was stunned by what I sensed on his palm \u2013 a few skeletons in the closet from his past. He anxiously asked me if his best friend had divulged something; to which I replied: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d While holding his hand, I had this sixth sense that this would be the hand that would hold my babies. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time and only brought it up a few years later when we were married. I have never forgotten it. It was Franco\u2019s Spain, and the beautiful young people were warned not to go on the beach at night for fear of being shot. So at night we stuck to our villas and partied on. Some days I felt the need to be alone and escape from all the madness and personalities and would head off to a small beach hotel for afternoon tea. Philip would often sing out, \u201cRhodesiac, can I come too?\u201d We would sit and drink tea, gazing at the Mediterranean. I was getting fonder and fonder of this guy who seemed to understand my black moods. Friends said there was electricity between us. Every time I turned around his big green eyes were riveted on mine. It was the happiest I have ever felt. Then, Philip headed to Italy and Greece with his friends, and life in Calpe became dull. The next time we met was at a party in London, and this was where we really fell in love. Sadly, I had to return to war-torn Rhodesia and my family. A couple of months later, Philip arrived and we were married beneath a southern African sky. More than 50 years and four beautiful children later, we are now travelling the globe together in our golden years. The one thing we\u2019ve always had in common is our passion for travel. I believe meeting Philip was kismet. Destiny. I\u2019m so grateful our two stars crossed paths. *** Is there a moment you knew?", "date": "2024-02-03", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Linda Townsend, as told to Melissa Noble", "id": 353, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/10700fd74d6dbd9340b22b7ce39660b1c07c24c0/0_0_2500_1500/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Josh Thomas: Let\u2019s Tidy Up review \u2013 comedian returns to the stage with stories of ADHD and autism", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/feb/03/josh-thomas-lets-tidy-up-review-comedian-returns-to-the-stage-with-stories-of-adhd-and-autism", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.061, "neu": 0.733, "pos": 0.207, "compound": 0.9959}, "body": "It\u2019s been four years, a pandemic and two seasons of his US show Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay since Josh Thomas last toured Australian stages, with 2019\u2019s Whoopsie Daisy. Though he started in standup as a teen (winning Melbourne international comedy festival\u2019s Raw Comedy competition at 17), Thomas jettisoned that part of his practice once he\u2019d made the move to TV in 2013, with his sweet, spiky, deliciously awkward and surprisingly touching series Please Like Me. Thomas has been fairly candid over the years about preferring the small screen as a vehicle for his material, saying that he\u2019ll only put together a new standup show if he has something to say. Whoopsie Daisy was mostly about the culture shock of moving to Los Angeles in the wake of Please Like Me\u2019s surprise US success; he\u2019d done the twink pool parties and the Hollywood meetings, and had a swag of loopy anecdotes to prove it \u2013 but he was also characteristically candid about his discomfort, and even unhappiness, in his new social milieu. In his new show, Let\u2019s Tidy Up, which lands at Sydney Opera House off the back of a US tour and before an Australian one, Thomas takes stock of his life in the wake of two significant diagnoses. The first was ADHD. \u201cWhen I got diagnosed nine years ago it was still on the cusp of being quite interesting,\u201d he says self-consciously in the show\u2019s opening stretch. \u201cEveryone has it now.\u201d Then two years ago, while making Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay \u2013 an LA-set show in which a thinly veiled version of himself takes legal guardianship over his two teenage half-sisters, one of them on the autism spectrum \u2013 he was diagnosed with autism: \u201cAnd that\u2019s got an edge, that\u2019s drama \u2013 that\u2019s a show!\u201d he jokes on stage. Let\u2019s Tidy Up pivots off an episode roughly two years ago in which Thomas tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to tidy his house, and the attendant fallout. It\u2019s a disarmingly relatable tale, told in that hyperactive Josh Thomas style; it starts with him buying a sous vide and needing a place to store it, and proceeds as he unspools a hoarder\u2019s-house worth of \u201cstuff\u201d from every nook and cranny. This episode is the loose spine of a show in which Thomas interrogates whether he should, or even can, change \u2013 and the slightly chilling effect that being formally diagnosed has had on his perspective. As he remarks in the show\u2019s opening, having a psychiatrist confirm that the world is indeed more challenging for him was unambiguously reassuring; being told that there was nothing he could do about it \u2013 that his behaviours are \u201cincurable\u201d \u2013 triggers more ambivalent feelings. It\u2019s a solid premise for a show, and Thomas takes satisfying aim at the self-improvement culture that is endemic to America, Instagram, capitalism and celebrity culture. The meat of the show, however, is personal anecdote, covering territory familiar to fans of his TV shows: childhood ignominies, adult faux pas, awkward social situations and dates; there are jokes about anal sex, herpes and Tinder. Some of the material perhaps feels overly familiar (there\u2019s a bit about his struggles with small talk that seems lifted from his 2019 show, and covered in his TV work: \u201cMy friends said I need to ask questions and then listen to the answers,\u201d he marvels. \u201cDo you know about this?\u201d) For better or worse, there are no real surprises to this show for those familiar with Thomas\u2019s work. Curiously, he co-wrote it with LA-based Australian expat Lally Katz, whom local theatre nerds may remember as the writer of oddball treats such as Atlantis and The Cat as well as her own brilliant one-woman show, Stories I Want to Tell You in Person. There are kooky flourishes that feel quintessentially Katz, and her authorial hand is referenced in the show (she also appears as a vivid, charismatic character in several anecdotes). But for a show with this kind of theatre pedigree, you might expect more of a narrative arc. Instead, the show feels chaotic in energy and structure, unfolding as a series of anecdotes within anecdotes; there\u2019s no real sense of the stakes. Thomas starts the show on a stage covered in confetti, in front of a table loaded with junk, with the declaration that he\u2019s never been to therapy and he\u2019s never going to, \u201cbecause I think that I\u2019m fine\u201d. 70-odd minutes later, there\u2019s more confetti \u2013 but less revelation than one might hope.

The supreme court\u2019s decision on Friday rebuffed a request by a conservative group to alter West Point\u2019s admissions process, which takes race \u2013 as well as a host of other factors \u2013 when selecting students who aspire to be future army officers. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, argued that the selection process was unconstitutional. It has previously found success in challenging selection criteria, with the supreme court agreeing to end affirmative action in higher education last year by striking down the race-conscious admissions policies at the universities of Harvard and North Carolina. However, while the latest ruling by a supreme court dominated by conservative justices did not fully resolve whether institutions like West Point could use race-based criteria for admissions, it refused to immediately accede to the complaint. \u201cThe record before this court is underdeveloped, and this order should not be construed as expressing any view on the merits of the constitutional question,\u201d the supreme court\u2019s order said. The US military\u2019s academies \u2013 including West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy and the Coast Guard Academy \u2013 have used race as a factor in choosing cadets for several years. Their goal is to reflect in officer positions the diversity of rank-and-file members of the military, as well as to reflect the diversity of the US itself. \u201cOur nation\u2019s military leaders have determined that a diverse army officer corps is a national security imperative and that achieving that diversity requires limited consideration of race in selecting those who join the army as cadets,\u201d Elizabeth Prelogar, the solicitor general, told the supreme court justices in a hearing that followed a decision by a lower court to not block West Point\u2019s admissions process. Students for Fair Admissions, which has also challenged the admissions process for the Naval Academy, criticized the court\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is disappointing that the young men and women who apply to West Point for the foreseeable future will have their race used as a factor to admit or reject them,\u201d said Edward Blum, president of the group. \u201cEvery year this case languishes in discovery, trial and appeals means that our nation\u2019s best and brightest young men and women will be classified, sorted and preferred based on their skin color rather than just on their abilities.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-03", "section": "Law", "author": "Oliver Milman", "id": 355, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f391f0edb26e064f847e30f7aceb09d50bf81b47/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Free school meals \u2018cut obesity and help reading skills\u2019 in England, study finds", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/04/free-school-meals-cut-obesity-help-reading-skills-england-study-finds", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.025, "neu": 0.743, "pos": 0.232, "compound": 0.9985}, "body": "Labour is facing calls from MPs to back the provision of free school meals for all primary school children in England, after a new study found evidence that it reduces obesity and boosts reading skills. Levels of obesity were reduced by 7% to 11% among reception children in the four London boroughs that have already adopted the policy, according to the study seen by the Observer. For children in year six, who had been given free school meals for their entire time in primary school, there was a 5-8% reduction. The study, by the Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex, found that apart from the cost of living help to parents, there was an associated increase in reading. It suggested that by the age of 11, the impact was equivalent to \u201capproximately two weeks\u2019 additional progress in school\u201d. It also found that making free school meals universal also increased their take-up by those who had already been entitled to them by 8%, possibly because it changed school culture and the stigma around having them. It appeared to lead to one in three children eating a school lunch for the first time. In England, all reception, year one and year two children are entitled to free lunches. Blanket free school meals have now been rolled out by London mayor Sadiq Khan across the capital until next year. All primary school children in Wales and Scotland are due to receive free school meals from this year. Offering free meals to all state primary school pupils would cost about \u00a31bn a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. A series of Labour MPs called for the national rollout of free meals. Stephen Timms, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said the policy was in place and working within his London borough. \u201cThe policy has been hugely popular among parents, and the research now shows that it is making a real difference to children\u2019s health and learning,\u201d he said. \u201cI welcome the decision by the mayor of London to extend the policy London-wide. It should be rolled out nationally, too.\u201d Kim Johnson, the Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, said that in her city, an average of 11 children in a class of 30 live in poverty. \u201cAccess to healthy, nutritious food is a necessity for children to thrive,\u201d she said. \u201cI have long supported the NEU\u2019s No Child Left Behind campaign to roll out universal free school meals to all primary and secondary pupils ... to ensure that hunger doesn\u2019t prevent children from learning, from reaching their full potential.\u201d Sharon Hodgson, chair of the all-party group on school food, said ministers had had evidence since 2013 on the benefits of such a scheme. \u201cUniversalism breaks the stigma of means-tested free school meals and breaks the cycle of inequalities that exist outside the school gates being reproduced in the dining hall,\u201d she said. \u201cSchool food is the best public health policy we have at our disposal. With it we have the opportunity to reach every child in the UK with hot, healthy, nutritious meals. That is why I have been calling for universal free school meals for over 14 years.\u201d Khan said he had \u201cpersonal experience\u201d of the difference free school meals can make. \u201cDelivering these meals to all state primary schoolchildren in London has been one of my proudest moments as mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been fantastic to hear from teachers about how much better pupils are performing this year and also how much families have benefited, with parents not having to worry about how to feed their children. As this study shows, providing all children with the offer of a nutritious meal during the school day helps to improve health and enable pupils to focus on their schoolwork, rather than worry about being hungry.\u201d Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, has pledged to have breakfast clubs in every primary school, funded from the abolition of non-dom tax status. However, the party has no plans to expand free school lunches. Researchers examined the impact of expanding the policy to all primary school children by studying four London boroughs \u2013 Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Newham and Islington \u2013 which have their own schemes. \u201cThere are lots of long-term benefits that we\u2019d expect, such as an improvement in reading ability, even at the end of primary school,\u201d said Dr Angus Holford, the study\u2019s co-author. \u201cOther evidence suggests this will persist into a benefit in lifetime earnings. Even if these effects on obesity prevalence don\u2019t fully persist into adulthood, even delaying the onset of obesity, or reducing your total lifetime duration of obesity, still reduces the risk of developing later diseases.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-04", "section": "Society", "author": "Michael Savage Policy Editor", "id": 356, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2affacdf20f56b7f21527d8ecfbb27b5eadf5dc4/0_0_4650_2790/500.jpg"}, {"title": "The Zone of Interest review \u2013 Jonathan Glazer\u2019s unforgettable Auschwitz drama is a brutal masterpiece", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/04/the-zone-of-interest-jonathan-glazer-brutal-auschwitz-drama-sandra-huller-christian-friedel-martin-amis", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.12, "neu": 0.666, "pos": 0.214, "compound": 0.9932}, "body": "Before you read on, a word of caution. There are some films \u2013 many of them \u2013 that impress on a first viewing but which start to trickle away, like a handful of sand, the moment you leave the cinema. Then there are others, far fewer in number, that strike like a lightning bolt on a first watch and stay with you, scarring themselves into your psyche and subtly but permanently shifting your movie-viewing paradigm on its axis. Jonathan Glazer\u2019s masterful and chilling The Zone of Interest fell into the second group for me. I left it shaken and stricken; it stayed with me, stubbornly, over the months that followed. As most film fans will agree, that kind of viscerally intense response to a film is the holy grail of cinema viewing. It\u2019s a vanishingly rare experience, and one that is magnified by the sense of discovery that comes from knowing virtually nothing about a film going in (I knew that it was a loose adaptation of the novel of the same title by Martin Amis, but little else). So with that in mind, to any readers who remain in the privileged position of knowing nothing about The Zone of Interest, consider putting aside this review and watching the film first. Otherwise, read on. To describe The Zone of Interest as an adapted screenplay is perhaps misleading (although it has secured an Oscar nomination in that category, along with four others, including best picture and best director). In fact, the film is very much its own brooding, boldly unconventional entity, sharing with Amis\u2019s book a title and a location \u2013 Auschwitz, or more specifically just outside the walls of the camp, in the home of a high-ranking Nazi and his family \u2013 but little else. The walls are a crucial component of this film, which shows the daily details of the life of an upwardly mobile Nazi couple \u2013 the commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf H\u00f6ss (Christian Friedel), and his wife, Hedwig (Sandra H\u00fcller) \u2013 and their five children. The H\u00f6ss family are raised according to the tenets of the Artaman League, a German anti-urban, back-to-the-land movement that advocated an agrarian ideal and respect for the natural world (Rudolf, a man who presides over the murders of thousands of people each week, dictates an aggrieved memo about the lack of respect for his prized lilacs). They enjoy wholesome, halcyon picnics by the river (predominantly captured, like most of the picture, in dispassionate mid and wide shots) and idyllic days in the lush, lovingly tended garden of the H\u00f6ss villa, a source of considerable pride for Hedwig. We never see beyond the walls that separate her cherished roses and dahlias from the industrial death factory on the other side. But through Johnnie Burn\u2019s incredible, immersive sound design, the ambient noise generated by the horrors within the camp is evoked with a suffocating intensity that matches the choking pall of smoke billowing continuously from the Auschwitz furnace chimneys. Burn\u2019s remarkable work is not the only aural element that contributes to the film\u2019s brutal power. Glazer reteams with composer Mica Levi, his collaborator on his previous film, Under the Skin. Levi\u2019s sparsely used score, accompanying eerie night-vision thermal images, jolts us out of the oblivious banality of the H\u00f6ss household. And their compositions bookend the picture, with what sounds like a chorus of tormented souls. A gnawing sense of dread permeates the entire film, created through sound and score, but also through telling details, such as the way the father\u2019s work has polluted his children\u2019s play (the older boy locks his little brother in a greenhouse and then teases him by making the hissing sound of gas). Imagine the stress levels of the chilling baby-on-the-beach sequence from Under the Skin, but stretched out to feature length. It\u2019s a bruising watch. Unshowy but impeccable in the two main roles, both Friedel and H\u00fcller excel. Friedel plays Rudolf as a pedantic, mid-level bureaucrat with a thin, needling voice and a despot\u2019s haircut, whose unquestioning efficiency and commitment to the cause of National Socialism has facilitated his rapid ascent within the SS. And H\u00fcller\u2019s Hedy chortles over her good fortune as she cherrypicks the choicest possessions of murdered Jewish prisoners, parading her newly elevated status like a purloined mink coat. Nowhere is the understated brilliance of H\u00fcller\u2019s performance better demonstrated than in the delivery of a single line of dialogue, said to her housemaid: \u201cI could have my husband spread your ashes across the fields of Babice.\u201d It could be wielded like a deadly weapon, but H\u00fcller says it conversationally, almost pleasantly.

Some of this is through official channels, not least the emails the school sends us. I say \u2018us\u2019, but the emails all go to his mum, which is unfortunate. Despite her many other admirable qualities, my wife has a tendency to let these pile up in her inbox, whereupon she sends them to me in clumps of five or six, by which time they may date from any time in the past month. This means we are the last to know if there are forms that need to be filled out, any cake sales on the horizon, or cases of West Nile virus ripping through the student population. Our other main resource is other, better parents, especially those who save our lives on a weekly basis in the parents\u2019 WhatsApp group. When Kingdom comes, there shall be a special place in heaven reserved for all those who write things like, \u2018What size ladder do we have to pack on Friday?\u2019 prompting my wife and I to realise that \u2018Bring a Ladder to School Day\u2019 has come round once more. But our number one resource is a visual cue on my son\u2019s person. I discover almost all information about his school days from the stickers he comes home with. Helpfully, they often come branded with text that makes their source immediately obvious. Even the most passive parent can make sense of bright yellow stickers that blare GOOD READING! or MATHS SUPERSTAR. But even more oblique offerings, like GREAT EFFORT, are rendered scrutable by the other marvellous thing about stickers; while my son cannot be bribed or cajoled into telling us about any part of his day from a simple suite of questions, he is positively enthusiastic to explain any sticker he receives. So it was that we discovered the exact text he\u2019d read to attain his first adhesive appliqu\u00e9, and the precise sums he\u2019d managed to get his second. The \u2018good effort\u2019 to which the third applied, was in making his handwriting extra neat in his copy book. He described this feat to us in full sentences \u2013 a first for any school-related activity \u2013 ending with a glorious flourish of garbled self-praise, \u2018I writed as neat as a pie.\u2019 This week\u2019s sticker was a big, bright-red heart with no text on it whatsoever, which he informed us marked him out as a \u2018fair play champion\u2019. This was, he told me, because he and his friend, Elena, had invited another child into their game in the playground. We rejoiced at his kindness, its reward and, moreover, the window it gave us into his daily life. Now, if only he can come home with a sticker that tells us what size ladder he needs to bring on Friday, we\u2019ll be laughing.

Where do you live and who with? I live in an intergenerational home in Auckland with my mum, my younger sister Ele (21), my cousins Anna (14) and Gabby (7), my grandpa, my partner and our family dog Koko. My grandma, also named Taualofa and our matriarch, lived with us too before she died six months ago. What do you do? Exist, lol. Dream daily about a better world. At the moment I\u2019m resting as I\u2019ve endured a lot of illness mentally and physically this year. I use journalism, writing, community activism and making as a form of service to my communities. I am a core member of a Samoan art collective. What apps do you use? Spotify and Netflix. I\u2019m on a social media break at the moment \u2013 except for TikTok. What do you listen to? I like listening to UK drill, Latin club music, Reggaeton, Afrobeats and 70\u2019s RnB. My mum generously passed on her love of 80\u2019s soft rock and 90\u2019s RnB, which are on heavy rotation for me \u2013 artists like Sade, Prince, Bee Gees, Jodeci and Babyface. My absolute favourite artists to listen to are Samoan and Tongan acoustic bands and choirs from the 70\u2019s. What do you eat? I\u2019m fixated on having fruit smoothies and peanut butter on toast, even for dinner sometimes. I eat mostly chicken, fish, rice and veggies. When I\u2019m feeling crap I\u2019ll probably binge eat Whittaker\u2019s Peanut Butter chocolate. I really enjoy cooking for my family but if I\u2019m exhausted I\u2019ll order Chinese. I think it\u2019s important to support our local economy and creative food businesses, if you are in a position to do so \u2013 my family and I do that on the weekends sometimes. How do you socialise? My socialisation levels are minimal and have been since Covid. I usually catch up with my best friend once or twice a month and we do a mix of making a meal together, playing video games, chilling, smoking cigarettes and drinking or watching a movie. We both have had a very turbulent 20s so far. What do you wear? I dress for my own comfort. A lot of brown and green tones. Grandma-style knit cardigans with cool patterns over long maxi dresses; cargo pants and a plain singlet, gold jewellery \u2013 I\u2019m never without my gold locket. For shoes: chunky sandals or my Doc Martin boots. Basketball shorts, slides, baggy tees. Very relaxed and mostly masculine. Tell us about your Saturday My sister, my partner and I go to a market to buy fresh fruits and veggies for our whole family. We have our music on blast while my partner drives us to south Auckland \u2013 vape smoke in the air, windows down. It\u2019s great, probably the highlight of my week. It\u2019s just us, no adults or kids. We like trying to get as much possible, while spending the least we can \u2013 it\u2019s like a game. We usually get a feed after from one of the small stalls \u2013 dumplings or kebabs \u2013 before making our way back to Central Auckland to a Pak\u2019nSave for our big grocery shop for the week. We usually plan our meals for in advance so we get everything we need. How do you relax? Being with my people gives me energy, which helps me to relax. When I do leave the house and am actually outside, I like to support my friends and Pacific creatives doing cool things \u2013 whether it\u2019s a gig, art show, a festival \u2013 events that bring community together,are judgment free, fun and offer a good time and/or good music. Walking, listening to ASMR, listening to music, making art, going for a swim, watching trashy reality TV also help me relax. I\u2019m such a chronic over-thinker, I\u2019m always overloading my brain and searching for deeper meanings, relationships, and reasons for existing \u2013 so, doing things that don\u2019t require much thought is really beneficial. What do you want? For young people to trust themselves and be courageous, loving and hopeful. For older people to listen, learn, to advocate for us and be bold and radical in their actions. For my loved ones to live without struggle or heaviness \u2013 to live full, joyful lives. For myself to welcome radical love and self acceptance and to practise joy daily. To fill my brain and to remain teachable. To achieve all my creative dreams. What do you fear? More loss as a family. To lose myself, or to witness a loved one lose themselves. What do you want to tell us? I believe in indigenous sovereignty in Aotearoa \u2013 what\u2019s good for M\u0101ori is good for us all and there is no room for racism or colonial projects in our future. I support land returned to Indigenous communities globally and for underserved communities to be treated with respect and compassion and tohave the tools to thrive. I want a fossil fuel free future, and no more deep sea drilling. I hope for a world that welcomes and celebrates our differences. What does the world in 2024 look like to you? We are going to see collective solidarity at its strongest, with young Indigenous and Pacific people showing the world how necessary it is for us to lead with empathy, compassion and radical love and joy. We are going to see more and more folk refusing the tools of colonialism and capitalism and leaning into healing alongside one another.

The Zone of Interest, about the domestic idyll constructed by Hedwig and Rudolph H\u00f6ss next door to Auschwitz, where he was camp commandant, won best picture and best director. Glazer thanked critics, audiences, his colleagues, \u201cand most of all my wife, as it\u2019s all about her at the end of the day anyway\u201d. His producer, James Wilson, said he believed the question posed by the film \u201cboils down\u201d to one of \u201cselective empathy: whether we care more about the health and safety and violence against some innocent people than others. It seems so stark in the world [today] that that is not the case.\u201d Wilson continued by saying he hoped it went without saying that people in \u201cUkraine and south Israel\u201d are \u201cas deserving of empathy as those in Gaza or Yemen or anywhere\u201d. The film also took the technical achievement prize for music and sound, awarded to Mica Levi and Johnnie Burn for their extraordinary soundtrack, which seeks to convey the unseen horrors behind the camp walls. Speaking to the audience, Levi also related the film to the current conflict in the Middle East. \u201cWorking on this film continues to be monumental for me, and is starting to be for my friends,\u201d they said. \u201cThe time we are in can\u2019t be ignored.

Speaking to the audience, Scott said: \u201cThis is completely wonderful \u2026 it just launched our film in the most extraordinary way, and it\u2019s made a difference.\u201d He nodded to the film\u2019s position at the top of the Irish box office, and it also having made No 1 in the UK, too. \u201cFor a gay love story, it ain\u2019t nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t say those films don\u2019t make money.\u201d He went on to thank his co-stars Claire Foy and Jamie Bell, \u201cmy sexy mum and dad\u201d, and the \u201calso sexy\u201d Paul Mescal, before thanking Haigh for allowing him to be part of a film which has elicited such emotional reactions. \u201cNever in my life have I had such heartfelt, raw responses from audiences.\u201d Scott finished by paying tearful tribute to his own mother and father, \u201cwho I\u2019ve thought about every day\u201d. Accepting the film of the year award, Haigh thanked critics for being \u201cso generous with the film\u201d and \u201cconnecting to it in really personal ways\u201d. Mescal won British/Irish Performer for his body of work in 2023; the actor has also appeared over the past 12 months in God\u2019s Creatures, Foe and Carmen. Thanking the voters for having helped \u201cfilms like [Strangers]\u201d which \u201cneed to be seen\u201d, he singled out Scott and Haigh, saying that working on the film \u201cwas one of the privileges of my life\u201d. While The Zone of Interest is in contention for five Oscars next month, All of Us Strangers was not nominated in a single category. And while both films are up for Baftas, All of Us Strangers\u2019 six nominations do not include a nod for Scott \u2013 an omission which met with considerable backlash. Meanwhile, best actress went to Emma Stone for Poor Things, consolidating her narrow lead over Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019s Lily Gladstone in the Oscars\u2019 race. Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph won best supporting actress for The Holdovers, repeating the win she has so far managed in every awards ceremony so far this season. However, there was a surprise in the supporting actor category, which went to Charles Melton for May December. The sweep of honours for Glazer and Haigh\u2019s films meant Oppenheimer \u2013 hotly tipped to sweep the Oscars \u2013 went home without a single award, as did Barbie and Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon. Justine Triet and Arthur Harari took the screenwriting award for Anatomy of a Fall, while Mstyslav Chernov accepted the documentary prize for 20 Days in Mariupol. Speaking to the crowd, Chernov said he believed \u201ccinema has the power to change history and how people will see our time, and maybe make better choices\u201d. Both The Zone of Interest and Anatomy of a Fall lost out to Celine Song\u2019s Past Lives for foreign-language film of the year, while Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s The Boy and the Heron won the animated film prize. Oscar-nominated Jeffrey Wright was presented with the Dilys Powell Award for Excellence in Film by his American Fiction director Cord Jefferson. Meanwhile, Wright\u2019s rival Colman Domingo took the inaugural Derek Malcolm Award for Innovation, named for the late Guardian film critic. How to Have Sex won two awards: international breakthrough performance for Mia McKenna-Bruce and Philip French Award for British/Irish breakthrough film-maker for writer/director Molly Manning Walker. Other winners included Lola Campbell, who won young performer for Scrapper, and Natalie Cubides-Brady, director of short film The Veiled City.

Martin is the septuagenarian optometrist who ploughs into her \u2013 or was it vice versa? \u2013 on the piste. The show has them meeting in the Deer Valley, Utah resort before the accident in question, ramping up the contrast between Sanderson\u2019s \u201csad\u201d life and Gwyneth\u2019s glamorous one. It ramps up everything else, too: this is a camp cartoon, delighted by the affair\u2019s every instance of shallowness, star-worship and bad faith. That can be fun. The show is packed with jokes, if often the obvious ones (\u201cI married Coldplay singer, and the colour beige personified, Chris Martin \u2026\u201d), and cheerfully unabashed by its basement-level production values. It co-opts the crowd to play supporting roles, including Paltrow\u2019s husband-to-be and Sanderson\u2019s girlfriend. (His lawyer is played by a muppet.) It shares with its audience a gossipy delight in the trial\u2019s more outre episodes (\u201cShe really did ask her that!\u201d) I\u2019m not sure those limited pleasures sustain for the two-hour duration. There\u2019s plenty that\u2019s extraneous, not least Gwyneth\u2019s encounters with the (cardboard) \u201cdeer of Deer Valley\u201d and its woodland pals. I felt a bit cheated that most of the songs are lip-synced rather than sung, for no clear reason. But Martin and Karp\u2019s commitment to the undertaking, and the latter\u2019s raised-eyebrow charisma, ensure that \u2013 unlike its protagonists \u2013 this arch courtroom drama / winter sports mashup avoids wipeout.

Biden and the Democratic National Committee had successfully lobbied to thwart tradition and designate South Carolina the first contest for the party\u2019s presidential nomination instead of Iowa and New Hampshire. On Saturday, Biden handily won more than 95% of the vote in the state that had launched his campaign in 2020. The long-shot candidates Dean Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota, and Marianne Williamson, a self-help author, trailed far behind. In two weeks, Donald Trump is expected to capture the win in the Republican primary in the same state, which Biden directly addressed in his statement soon after his victory was confirmed. \u201cIn 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the presidency,\u201d he said. \u201cNow in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the presidency again \u2013 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2013 again.\u201d While Biden\u2019s victory was a foregone conclusion in the state, voter turnout served as a proxy for enthusiasm about his candidacy, especially among the significant Black voting population. Leading up to the primary, there had been some signals he has lost traction among Black voters since 2020: his approval rating among Black adults is 42% in the latest Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Research poll, a substantial drop from the first year of his presidency. In South Carolina, the results were mixed. Democrats touted early voting numbers: \u201cWith results still coming in, Black voters made up approximately 76% of the early vote \u2013 a significant increase over 2020, where Black voters made up 56% of the primary electorate,\u201d said Michael Tyler, the Biden-Harris campaign\u2019s communications director. But overall voter turnout was on track to be much lower than previous primary years, indicating that even the high stakes of a Biden-Trump rematch might not be enough to mobilize voters for the incumbent. The campaign is hoping that the recent strong economic indicators will bolster Biden\u2019s low approval rating, fueled by voter hesitations about his handling of the Israel-Gaza war, immigration and other domestic issues. But the Phillips campaign, which had just upwards of 2,000 votes, tried to capitalize on the turnout issue anyway. \u201cI congratulate the President for getting the most votes tonight. But the lack of voter enthusiasm for a Trump-Biden rematch is being reflected in each and every Democratic primary result this election,\u201d Phillips said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cVoters are disappointed that they lack options beyond the choice between a threat to the fabric of the nation and a good man who voters want to pass the baton.\u201d While the national picture has yet to play out more fully, poll workers and state Democrats celebrated a successful election process, and South Carolina\u2019s new status, on Saturday. Sam Skardon, chairman of the Charleston county Democratic party, said he was happy volunteers and voters came \u201cto gather and celebrate being first in the nation and all the work that everyone has put in it\u201d. \u201cEveryone here volunteered long and hard to make this primary successful and to keep us in the top of the Democratic election cycle for years to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means a lot for our party. It means a lot for our state.

Often there\u2019s a residual fear that the spots might come back, which makes habits such as covering skin with makeup tough to break. My advice is to step down in stages. You could add a little moisturiser to your usual foundation, thinning it out to make a DIY tinted moisturiser. Better still is a BB cream \u2013 a combination of skincare, sun protection and a little pigment for light coverage. BB creams also tend to have more skin-priming ingredients than tinted moisturisers, so they generally last longer on the skin and have a slight \u201cblurring\u201d effect, too. We all deserve to feel confident in our own skin, but having been conditioned to aspire to look perfectly airbrushed, it can be tough to fully embrace it. If you\u2019re feeling brave, you could try a \u201cstep away day\u201d and ditch makeup entirely for one day. This is a reminder that we deserve to be who we are, and that anything we wear is merely an accoutrement.

Keep checking the iPlayer, ITVX, etc For smart TV and laptop watchers, arguably the first port of call should be the main on-demand services such as BBC iPlayer, ITVX, Channel 4 (formerly known as All 4), My5 and STV Player. Films sometimes come and go quite quickly, so it\u2019s worth getting into the habit of checking regularly. At the time of writing, the iPlayer was offering Oscar winners The Theory of Everything, the Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga version of A Star Is Born, and Sound of Metal. From 1 March, ITVX is showcasing a selection of Oscar-winning and nominated films, including No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, Drive and Dogtooth (the latter an early film by the Poor Things director, Yorgos Lanthimos), plus all-time classics such as The Apartment, Vertigo and Rear Window. These services typically require you to register and sign in to use them. And, of course, with all the above bar the iPlayer, there are adverts during the films, unless you opt to pay and see fewer ads or go ad-free. 2. Find new channels Scroll through your TV\u2019s main menu and you will probably find channels you have never watched or even heard of. For example, Amazon Freevee is a free, ad-supported streaming service boasting thousands of shows and movies, including A Dangerous Method, starring Keira Knightley, and Darren Aronofsky\u2019s acclaimed drama Requiem for a Dream. Plex is a free-with-ads service with an excellent range of old and new movies. It boasts a particularly good selection of foreign, arthouse and midnight movie gems, including Japanese classics by Akira Kurosawa, Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi, several movies by the Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, and a stack of Bollywood films. Other channels include the vintage movie specialist Talking Pictures TV, Great! Movies, LEGEND, Rakuten TV, Pluto TV and wedotv. How and where to watch these services will vary, depending on your kit and your preference \u2013 it might be via Freeview, Sky or Virgin Media, or via an app on your TV or device, or via another platform. In most cases there is a website that spells this out. 3. Use free trials Many of the streaming services offer free trials, so you could sign up, watch a lot of films and then cancel before you are rolled over into a paid-for subscription (read the terms and conditions very carefully to make sure you are not caught out). Apple TV+ is running a free seven-day trial, giving you the chance to watch Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon, which has been nominated for 10 Oscars. Its other movies include the 2021 film Coda, winner of three Oscars including Best Picture. Amazon Prime has a 30-day free trial, allowing you to check out new movies such as Saltburn and Foe, a sci-fi drama starring Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan. Students can get six months\u2019 free membership when signing up to Prime Student. Other services offering seven-day free trials include Paramount+ (its movies include the Tom Cruise blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick and Babylon, starring Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie), Lionsgate+, StudioCanal Presents, MGM, and four that are particularly good for arthouse fare and classics: BFI Player, Curzon, Mubi and the eastern Europe specialist Klassiki. Netflix does not currently offer free trials. 4. Beware of illegal sites \u201cBe careful when you search online \u2013 many websites will send you to dubious destinations that not only stream illegal content but also slam you with spammy warnings and pop-up windows,\u201d says Or Goren at the website Cord Busters. He says that in general, if it looks too good to be true \u2013 for example, the most recent Hollywood hits being offered \u201cfor free\u201d \u2013 then \u201cthere\u2019s something fishy\u201d. Last autumn Guardian Money highlighted how people in the UK who illegally stream movies, sport and TV shows online were being warned they risked having their bank accounts emptied or their identities stolen. The BeStreamWise campaign also points out that people who watch pirated content can potentially be prosecuted. 5. Scan listings If you want to watch films for free on the big screen, event listings websites can help. For example, Eventbrite lists free screenings around the country, which often take place at libraries and community spaces. In north London, Wood Green library is showing Citizen Kane on 15 February, The Book Thief on 22 February and Vertigo on 29 February, while Laxton Victory Hall in Laxton, East Yorkshire, has a \u201cromcom movie night\u201d (film TBC) on 23 FebruaryThe Plaza cinema in the Liverpool suburb of Waterloo also runs community screenings, with the next ones scheduled for 6 February and 5 March. Museums and galleries sometimes host free film screenings. BFI Southbank in London has the Mediatheque, where you can explore the riches of the British Film Institute\u2019s national archive for free, including classics such as Brief Encounter and Withnail and I. Some cinemas organise free screenings for certain groups. For example, BFI Southbank has screenings that are free for the over-60s. The next ones are the Oscar-nominated 2016 romantic drama Loving on 5 February and the 1992 drama Blue Black Permanent on 1 March. 6. Join a club A number of services discreetly offer free and cheap tickets to movies and other events, often at short notice \u2013 it\u2019s typically about filling empty seats and building a buzz. One of the best for movies is ShowFilmFirst, which occasionally offers free tickets to previews, director Q&amp;As and so on (you have to apply to be a member, and it will let you know if you\u2019ve been successful). Also check out Free Movies UK (FMUK), a non-profit, free-membership organisation and web forum dedicated to getting its members \u201cas many free cinema tickets [typically provided by film distributors] as possible\u201d. 7. More freebies on the way A new BFI-supported multi-year project called Escapes will offer free film screenings in cinemas to almost 1 million people across the UK. Beginning in early 2024, Escapes will offer regular free screenings at up to 400 cinemas and aim \u201cto grow cinema engagement across the UK and break down primary barriers to cinema-going among audiences, particularly those excluded by price\u201d.

Stuart\u2019s meeting with the corporation\u2019s UK boss, Louise Kingham, last year came days after BP had announced a record profit of $28bn (\u00a323bn) for 2022, raised its dividend to shareholders, and rowed back on its aim to cut its carbon emissions by 2030. Households were also enduring very high energy bills. BP will report its profits for 2023 on Tuesday. Stuart also asked for advice from Kingham about winning the argument that UK oil production was \u201cgood\u201d and part of the net zero transition. Experts have repeatedly refuted arguments that new oil and gas production can increase UK energy security or lower prices. The UK\u2019s oil and gas body granted 24 new drilling licences to BP and other companies last Wednesday, following 27 licences in October and with more to follow in the coming months. The chair of the UK\u2019s official climate advisers said in January that \u201cfurther licensing [is] inconsistent with climate goals\u201d. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that any new fossil fuel developments were incompatible with reaching net zero emissions by 2050. \u201cDrilling for new North Sea oil will undermine the UK\u2019s climate commitments and won\u2019t ensure energy security, yet the minister cynically sought BP\u2019s help to try and \u2018win\u2019 the opposite argument,\u201d said Chris Garrard, of the campaigns and research organisation Culture Unstained, which made the FoI request. \u201cWhat\u2019s more disturbing though, is that days after BP had announced record profits, he seems to assure BP that there are incentives and money to keep its polluting fossil fuels flowing, all while the public struggled to pay their energy bills,\u201d he said. The documents released include a heavily redacted readout of a meeting between Stuart and Kingham on 17 February 2023. Stuart asked: \u201cWhere do you think we are in terms of having the right incentives in place to maximise recovery from [the] North Sea and keep making the case to win the argument why producing it in the UK is good, and is part of the net zero transition, to make sure we minimise our imports?\u201d He said: \u201cThe money is there, making incentives and structures to allow it to flow.\u201d Stuart also asked Kingham for information to use in making the argument for new North Sea production: \u201cWe will be using oil and gas and, if we don\u2019t do it ourselves, we will be spending that money elsewhere. Adding that up I would like a number saying do we really want to spend x billions relying on foreign imports.\u201d Large sections of Kingham\u2019s responses are redacted, with government officials citing \u201ccommercially confidential information\u201d. But she said: \u201cIdeologically, you need to think where to do tax or incentives, because you won\u2019t get the investment.\u201d She also said BP was \u201cproud of [its] work and the jobs it creates and ever cleaner barrels\u201d, adding that the argument would be \u201camplified by some social media and ads\u201d. Tessa Khan, at the campaign group Uplift, said: \u201cBP\u2019s got a nerve telling our government that the industry needs more tax breaks and subsidies or they won\u2019t invest, in the middle of a cost of living crisis driven by energy bills and when it\u2019s just announced $28bn in profit.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s really egregious, though, is the minister responding that \u2018the money is there\u2019 for profiteering oil giants at the same time as it\u2019s just cut off vital support to millions of households who literally can\u2019t afford to heat their homes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question at all about whose side this government is on.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cMinister Stuart is absolutely right to be backing domestic oil and gas, as the UK will still be using oil and gas even when we reach net zero in 2050. It is good for our energy security, supports up to 200,000 jobs and has brought in \u00a3400bn in tax revenue to date [over the past 50 years] which has been used to help families with the cost of living and fund public services. The \u00a36bn raised by our energy profits levy on oil and gas producers alone helped us pay around half a typical household\u2019s energy bill last winter.\u201d \u201cMinisters will continue to meet with energy companies to encourage investment into the UK and end reliance on costly foreign imports of liquefied natural gas with higher emissions,\u201d she said. A spokesperson for BP said: \u201cBP is a major UK-headquartered company with plans to invest significantly in the UK\u2019s energy systems and transition. As such, we have regular meetings with government departments. This discussion focused on how the UK could continue to attract investment and maintain pace after the US Inflation Reduction Act in both today\u2019s oil and gas system and in renewable and low carbon projects.\u201d The act supports renewable energy. Fossil fuel companies have received \u00a380bn in UK government support since 2015. Most of the 24 new drilling licences were granted to foreign companies. On Friday it was revealed that an oil and gas company owned by a major Tory donor, which had previously been fined for illegal flaring, was awarded one of the drilling licences. In January, the former Conservative energy minister Chris Skidmore resigned as an MP in protest at the party\u2019s dash for oil and gas, calling the policy a \u201ctragedy\u201d that is \u201cwrong and will cause future harm\u201d.", "date": "2024-02-05", "section": "Environment", "author": "Damian Carrington Environment editor", "id": 365, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb70eb8bd204c4427db298c18c5e63a628ea6c2/893_575_4932_2959/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Bruce Willis\u2019 wife writing book about being his caregiver after dementia diagnosis", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/06/bruce-willis-wife-emma-heming-new-book-dementia-diagnosis-caregiving-release-information", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.093, "neu": 0.688, "pos": 0.218, "compound": 0.9904}, "body": "Bruce Willis\u2019 wife Emma Heming Willis is set to publish a book about her experience as a caregiver to her husband after he was disagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.

A year later, it was announced that he had been formally diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Symptoms of FTD include emotional problems, trouble communicating, struggles with walking and difficulty working, according to the National Institute on Aging. When his diagnosis was made public, actors and directors who worked with Willis revealed they had been quietly voicing their concerns about his cognitive state for years, as he struggled to remember dialogue, needed lines rewritten to be shorter, expressed confusion at his surroundings and required shortened work days. The Razzie awards, which recognise the worst films and performances and had created a prize just for Willis\u2019 many appearances in films in 2021, withdrew the category after his condition was revealed.

The so-called prominence legislation has been designed to guarantee local, free-to-air TV services Seven, Nine, Ten, SBS and the ABC are easy for Australian audiences to find on smart TVs. This will ensure the dissemination of local news and emergency information as well as supporting the local creative and communications industries. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup If passed, the law would oblige device manufacturers to include a number of features to reduce the risk of free-to-air broadcasting services being crowded out by the likes of Netflix and Disney+. The minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, revealed the regulations would mean new devices would need to provide access to free-to-air networks, pre-install their video-on-demand apps \u2013 such as iview and 10Play \u2013 and present separate tiles, tabs or links to provide easy access to each service. However, the requirements will not apply retrospectively to existing television sets, and the legislation does not include features sought by the free-to-air industry such as search functions that prioritise free-to-air networks over the streamers. Rowland said the reforms would help ensure free local services remain easily accessible to Australian audiences on their connected television devices, even as technology changes. \u201cLocal, free-to-air television informs and entertains all Australians, contributing to our shared sense of identity and cultural life,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cThe Albanese government\u2019s new prominence framework delivers on our election commitment to modernise media laws and level the playing field, recognising the important role that free-to-air broadcasters continue to play for Australians \u2013 no matter where they live or what they earn.\u201d Last year Astra, the subscription media industry\u2019s lobby group, campaigned against the changes, including through a series of full-page newspaper advertisements that declared: \u201cNow the government wants to control your TV.\u201d Bridget Fair, the chief executive officer of Free TV Australia, said Astra\u2019s campaign was \u201chighly misleading\u201d. Astra advocates on behalf of the likes of Foxtel, Binge, Disney+ and the Australian Christian Channel. Ramon Lobato, an associate professor from RMIT\u2019s school of media and communication, told the Guardian last year that prominence is an existential challenge for Australian public service broadcasters, which do not have the resources to pay market rates for visibility in smart TV interfaces. \u201cThe smart TV testing we\u2019ve done at RMIT suggests that local broadcaster apps are substantially less visible, less frequently preinstalled, and less discoverable through search and recommendations than the major US services \u2013 Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video and Disney+,\u201d he said. Australia is one of several countries going down this legislative pathway. In the UK the bill ensures BBC iPlayer, ITVX, Channel 4 and My5 are easy to find on smart TVs.

It\u2019s a horror-inspired video game in which players fight to overcome the problems that are holding them back, from fear of failure to addiction. It\u2019s also the centrepiece of her first institutional solo show, which takes on the theme of transformation. I grapple with the game but, by my fourth round, I\u2019m still no good; synthetic screams echo around the empty gallery. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be super hard!\u201d laughs Brathwaite-Shirley. \u201cIt\u2019s all based on things that I\u2019m trying to overcome or have overcome. It didn\u2019t take one turn, it took many.\u201d The Rebirthing Room is the latest of Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s participatory works. The idea came to her after a conversation with a curator about the usefulness of art galleries. \u201cWe were talking about the ways we could use a space to do something more. Rather than just showing a piece, what can it do?\u201d she says. \u201cThen I thought: it would be amazing if you came to a gallery and left as a different person.\u201d The 29-year-old began making interactive art in 2020 after a misguided comment from a visitor left her questioning her work\u2019s purpose. At the time, her portfolio consisted of videos and animations that documented the London burlesque scene she was involved with, as well as her Black transgender peers. Presented in what she describes as a \u201cbeautiful, retro-aesthetic\u201d style, it created alternative realities for members of her community \u2013 an unconventional approach to archiving to remedy the blind spots in historical records. \u201cSomeone said to me: I really like your work because I can bathe in the visuals and ignore what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Brathwaite-Shirley recalls. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s the best feedback I\u2019ve ever had in my life \u2026 because I cannot do that any more!\u201d From then on, she started incorporating choices for audience members to make in order to progress through the work. In 2022, she presented Get Home Safe, an arcade-style game inspired by her own experiences of walking around Berlin at night, where players are tasked with guiding the protagonist through dark streets safely. Meanwhile, last year\u2019s browser-based I Can\u2019t Follow You Anymore asks the audience to navigate a revolution and decide who will be saved or sacrificed. \u201cIn interactive work, you have to put effort in to see anything at all,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the choices people make and the feeling they leave with that I\u2019m fascinated with. I think that\u2019s when the real artwork begins to happen.\u201d Keen to prioritise content over aesthetics, Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s new work draws on the rudimentary pre-rendered graphics of early computer games. It\u2019s deliberately lo-fi, built from 2D animations, iPad drawings and outdated software, with a VHS-style finish. The grass in the on-screen forest is made from edited photographs of her hands, while the sounds are developed from recordings of herself screaming into her phone \u2013 an extension of her archival project. \u201cI never want to get to this super high-glossy thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to make people\u2019s brains work a little bit more.\u201d Complete with disorienting sound effects and low lighting, the Rebirthing Room is a fully immersive experience. Surrounding the screens and the handbuilt, audience-operated controller are huge trees draped in fabric and rows of real corn \u2013 a reference to the horror movies she grew up watching. \u201cThe thing I like about horror is that it makes you want to go through experiences and feelings that you would never want to on a typical day,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the film\u2019s really good, something about it keeps you there. It\u2019s a really nice balance of it being super scary but intriguing enough to keep you with it.\u201d Beyond being a nifty device to \u201ctrick\u201d viewers into reckoning with their own values and beliefs, Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s digital universes filled with demons, villains and gore feel appropriate for the current climate. As well as the hostility from outsider groups, it\u2019s also important to highlight all the \u201cmessy nuances\u201d that exist within one\u2019s own, she says: \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re in such a censored time, [where] even speaking about a view that your particular political group agrees with feels dangerous because it feels like you have to say it in the way that they want to hear it. And so for me, presenting a utopia in the settings we\u2019re currently in is very, very much useless.\u201d Challenging the audience is something she wants to see more of in the art world, which she feels too often favours pleasant, Instagram-friendly experiences. It\u2019s not her aim to make people enjoy her work; she finds a more visceral, emotional reaction more interesting. She tells me that if she leaves a show with only compliments, she feels that her work has done nothing. She\u2019s curious about how the audience will respond to the Rebirthing Room. Will they play until they succeed? Or will they, like me, give up? Only time will tell. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to see how I can push it further next time,\u201d she says. \u2022 Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley: The Rebirthing Room is at Studio Voltaire, London, until 28 April 2024", "date": "2024-02-06", "section": "Art and design", "author": "Safi Bugel", "id": 368, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4c1b69968ce179bd0fce18cfd2f5df5a818215e4/94_0_2813_1688/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Two new plays in London up for $25,000 Susan Smith Blackburn prize", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2024/feb/06/plays-opening-in-london-susan-smith-blackburn-prize-april-de-angelis-rhianna-ilube", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.031, "neu": 0.678, "pos": 0.291, "compound": 0.9974}, "body": "Two new plays about to open in London have been nominated for this year\u2019s Susan Smith Blackburn prize for female, transgender and non-binary playwrights.

The coalition government\u2019s austerity programme in the early 2010s is associated with steeper increases in frailty with age compared with the pre-austerity years between 2002 and 2010, the study led by the University of Edinburgh shows. The findings were published in the journal Plos One. More people living with frailty means that relatively minor health problems, such as urinary tract infections, are likely to have a greater effect on the population\u2019s long-term health and wellbeing. Frailty is generally characterised by issues such as reduced muscle strength and fatigue. Previous research had found that a slowdown in improvements in life expectancy coincided with the government\u2019s sharp cuts to health and social care funding after David Cameron came to power more than a decade ago. However, the mechanism through which drastic cuts were associated with decreased life expectancy had been unclear until now. In the new study, researchers analysed data on the frailty index, which captures age-related declines in functional ability and physical and mental health. The analysis included more than 16,000 people enrolled in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 2002-2018, with an average age of 67. Researchers found that frailty index scores increased more rapidly with age after the implementation of austerity policies. This was the case for all population groups, across genders and socioeconomic groups, but was particularly so for the oldest people in England. \u201cCompared to the 2000s, we found that older people in England were becoming more frail, more quickly during the 2010s, and that frailty was particularly common in the poorest in society,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cOur work is another warning about the possible impacts of austerity on the health of an ageing nation.\u201d Prof Adam Gordon, the president of the British Geriatrics Society, said the findings showed how the number of people living with frailty had increased sharply since austerity began. \u201cAs frontline healthcare professionals, we see every day how social isolation, the inability to get out, to exercise and to eat well, impact upon health and wellbeing of older people,\u201d he said. \u201cOlder people with frailty are more likely to need the help of health and social care services. In emergency departments, those over the age of 80 have seen their average wait times double, more than for any other age group.\u201d People living with frailty also face the longest waiting lists for elective surgery, and for care in the community, Gordon said. \u201cBesides the suffering experienced by those involved, this is an example of how austerity can end up costing the nation more in the longer term.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are desperately failing our parents and grandparents and this should be a source of national embarrassment. In this election year, it\u2019s essential that all major political parties have clear strategies for investment care and support services, not just for older people who already live with frailty, but for those at risk of developing it in the near future.\u201d Caroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s charity director, said frailty was often the all too visible yet frequently neglected feature of older people\u2019s health. \u201cCharacterised by vulnerability to sudden changes and deterioration in health, frailty is often in the background of pressures across the NHS as older people are made to reach crisis point before getting any help,\u201d she said. \u201cThis includes needing emergency care, and avoidable stays in hospital for want of a decent package of social care or proactive support in the community. \u201cIt is not surprising that when fewer services are available to the public, more older people experience frailty that could have been managed or even avoided. We\u2019ve seen this again with the impact of the pandemic and cost of living crisis that have left older people without the services and support to stay well.\u201d Abrahams said frailty was avoidable and with the right support the condition could be improved or at the very least remain stable. \u201cResponding to that reality is critical for the future success of both NHS and social care and for the wellbeing of our older and ageing population,\u201d she said. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cFourteen years of the Conservatives hollowing out our public services has left our country weaker and less healthy. People\u2019s lives have been cut short and what should be their golden years are increasingly spent in pain and discomfort.\u201d The government said it was providing the NHS and social care with \u00a314.1bn this year and next to improve care for patients across the country. \u201cWe are committed to improving healthy life expectancy by five years by 2035 and reducing regional disparities by 2030 to help people live longer, healthier lives,\u201d a spokesperson added.", "date": "2024-02-07", "section": "Society", "author": "Andrew Gregory Health editor", "id": 370, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/97341c39d9d407cdf56970380a2554c074738482/201_242_3551_2130/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Furious jumping: why Henry Cavill is wrong to be cross with sex scenes", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/08/furious-jumping-why-henry-cavill-is-wrong-to-be-cross-with-sex-scenes", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.094, "neu": 0.701, "pos": 0.205, "compound": 0.9954}, "body": "This has been a banner year for the sex scene. Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal in All of Us Strangers. Barry Keoghan and a freshly dug grave in Saltburn. Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh and the Bhagavad-Gita in Oppenheimer. Emma Stone and the rest of the cast in Poor Things. Between them, these films have pushed the boundaries of what a cinematic sex scene can be. They\u2019ve been tender, sad, passionate, thought-provoking, gruesome and excruciating in equal measure. But try telling that to Henry Cavill. \u201cI don\u2019t understand them \u2013 I\u2019m not a fan,\u201d Cavill recently said of sex scenes during an interview on Josh Horowitz\u2019s Happy Sad Confused podcast. \u201cI think there are circumstances where a sex scene actually is beneficial to a movie, rather than just the audience, but I think sometimes they\u2019re overused these days.\u201d Which is all very sweet, in that this is the sort of thing your nan would say. But then again the subject did put Cavill in something of a bind. On one hand, maybe he really does mentally switch off from whatever he\u2019s watching during a sex scene, the way that most people do whenever there\u2019s a song in a musical. But, really, what\u2019s the alternative open to him? Going \u201cCOR YEAH I LOVE BOOBS, ME!\u201d? That\u2019s hardly a very edifying thing to hear from Superman, is it? Cavill continued: \u201cSex scenes can be great in a movie and can really help with the storytelling, but most of the time the human imagination is going to trump it. So, it can be a little bit of a cop-out if a TV show or a movie is just filled with gyrating bodies and you\u2019re going, \u2018OK but what is this doing for us apart from the idea of, oh naked person, great\u2019.\u201d From this we can assume two things. The first is that Henry Cavill is not a fan of the television programme Euphoria, the whole point of which is \u201cOh, naked person, great\u201d. The second is that maybe Henry Cavill is really just talking about himself here. Especially in his early years, Cavill starred in several \u201cOh, naked person, great\u201d sex scenes. His first film Laguna is full of narratively superfluous sex scenes, plus it\u2019s also important to remember that he was in The Tudors, which was less a television series and more just a lot of outrageous and barely justified bonking stitched together with the loosest semblance of historical storytelling. Perhaps if you\u2019d spent years of your life joylessly humping away at a colleague in the knowledge that your tender moment of vulnerability would be forever preserved on the internet devoid of all context, you wouldn\u2019t be keen on the idea either. Also it\u2019s worth pointing out that, overall, Cavill is wrong. A 2019 study revealed that only 1.21% of movies made in the 2010s contained nudity, lower than any decade since the 1960s. There are many possible reasons for this. As I just mentioned, fear of ending up naked on a Mr Skin gallery for all eternity might put some actors off. Also, now that the film industry is almost totally reliant on four-quadrant tent-pole blockbusters, there are fewer opportunities to make the sort of sexy mid-budget adult drama that made up a vital chunk of the movie ecosystem in the 1990s. Plus the appetite simply isn\u2019t there any more. In October, research was released indicating that Gen Z is actively turned off by onscreen sex, with almost half of respondents (aged between 13 and 24) saying that sex was not a necessary plot device, and that movies should place more focus on platonic friendships. Also, you know, the internet exists now. There\u2019s such a low barrier to seeing filmed nudity online that it almost seems redundant to put it in an actual film. And yet, done well, there\u2019s still something bracing about movie sex. Especially now, where prestige film-makers seem to be rolling their sleeves up and digging in with more gusto than in recent memory. Viewed in a cluster, Poor Things, Saltburn, All of Us Strangers and Saltburn almost seem like a weird post-Covid celebration. We all spent such a big portion of our lives covered and sterile and distant that there\u2019s something quite joyous about the sight of naked bodies being flung together with total abandon. You know something must be in the air when a figure as musty as Christopher Nolan decides to make his actors whip their clothes off and grind away before the entire United States Atomic Energy Commission. So maybe Henry Cavill just hasn\u2019t worked with the right director yet. Perhaps with the proper encouragement, and a good script, and a decent amount of Oscar buzz, he will finally soften his attitude towards onscreen sex. Maybe one day he\u2019ll even be as cool with it as he is with killing loads and loads of people in films, which he does seem to be perfectly fine with.", "date": "2024-02-08", "section": "Film", "author": "Stuart Heritage", "id": 371, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/fd2213f308295e214488f2fb5d4b34ad90bc9a4b/878_147_2626_1576/500.jpg"}, {"title": "I become extra superstitious every lunar new year \u2026 especially when it comes to eating dumplings | Jennifer Wong", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/09/lunar-new-year-australia-superstitions-traditions", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.104, "neu": 0.584, "pos": 0.312, "compound": 0.9972}, "body": "Every year there is a two-week period when I become a superstitious Chinese person. I am Chinese year-round but my belief in superstitions ramps up around lunar new year. It is irrational, I know, to believe that I \u2013 a regular person with no magical powers \u2013 can control how much good luck or bad luck I receive, by doing things like not washing my hair or sweeping at particular times. And yet. Am I living with such an abundance of luck right now that I want to risk washing or sweeping it all away? No, which is why I won\u2019t do these things on the first day of the lunar year (that\u2019s this Saturday, in case you feel similarly). Also, bonus: clean hair and a clean home to start the year. Is this \u2026 self-care? A lot of Chinese new year superstitions require no effort. So why not abide by them, just in case? There\u2019s the belief that you shouldn\u2019t give pears or knives as presents, because the word for pears (\u68a8, l\u00ed) sounds like the word for \u201cto leave\u201d (\u96e2, l\u00ed: indicating that you want to leave the relationship), and knives symbolise your wish to sever ties. It is incredibly easy to adhere to this. Pears aren\u2019t in season in Australia anyway, and have you seen the price of knives? Some superstitions do require effort, and that effort mainly involves eating. For example, the idea that the more dumplings you eat, the richer you\u2019ll get. What an imaginative and hopeful culture, to come up with this beautiful fantasy, based on the fact that dumplings are the shape of ingots, an olden-day form of currency. If your family and friends are concerned about the huge number of potstickers you eat in the next few weeks, you can say it\u2019s in your best financial interests to do so. It\u2019s the superstitions surrounding death that I really pay attention to. Superstitions are simply another way to express our preferences if we were given a choice: I prefer to be lucky, I prefer to have good relationships, I prefer to have money. The ultimate preference, of course, is to be alive \u2013 and to wish for the long and happy lives of the people you love. So during the new year I don\u2019t wear black or white, which are the colours of mourning. And I will avoid the number four (\u56db, s\u00ec), which in Chinese sounds like the word for death, or to die (\u6b7b, s\u01d0). I avoid this number when it comes to the number of pieces of fruit I buy or even the number of times I grind salt or pepper. I didn\u2019t realise until recently that lunar new year is not the only time I avoid this number. Six months ago my uncle in Hong Kong became ill with a rare form of cancer. A few days before my mum was about to visit him, knowing it would be for the last time, we were in a cafe together in Sydney. I went up to the counter to order coffees and the waiter gave me a sign for our table: 44. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to take that number back to my mum, even though it was just a number, and it\u2019s not as though a luckier one would change what was to come. But why remind her of the sadness at hand when there were plenty of other numbers on the counter? I asked the waiter if I could change my sign. \u201cI\u2019m Chinese,\u201d I said. He nodded and handed me a 12. It wasn\u2019t an eight \u2013 the luckiest number because it sounds like \u201cto prosper\u201d \u2013 but it would do. After all, you can\u2019t always control what life gives you.

Staff are demanding a pay increase to \u00a315 an hour and the right to negotiate with the company over pay and conditions.

The union withdrew an application to the independent Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) last year, accusing Amazon of drafting in at least 1,000 additional workers to ensure the GMB could not show it represented a clear majority of staff at the site.

The 45-year-old is promising a career-spanning show that will be two minutes longer than the regular 13-minute performances from past years. \u201cI can\u2019t explain why, but it\u2019s a funny thing that I was able to do and craft,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThat was a huge strategic thing that happened between me and my agency.\u201d The singer has still called it \u201cdifficult\u201d to find a way to squeeze his entire career into such a short amount of time. Usher released his first album in 1994 at the age of 16. He has since gone onto sell over 80m records worldwide with major hits including U Make Me Wanna, Good Kisser and Love in This Club. Usher has confirmed that, as is tradition, there will be some surprise guests and told Entertainment Tonight that it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d not to invite his Yeah collaborators Lil Jon and Ludacris up to the stage. He also revealed that he has been getting advice from the previous half-time performer Katy Perry and called it \u201ca moment I\u2019ve prepared for during the last 30 years\u201d which will \u201cdefinitely be an event\u201d. Last year saw Rihanna take the stage with the star making it the most-watched half-time show ever with 121 million viewers. His set will take place during the half-time section of this year\u2019s big game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs, in Las Vegas. It will mark the first time the city has hosted the Super Bowl. Usher recently finished an 18-month Vegas residency. The Chiefs player Travis Kelce has also been making headlines for his much-publicised relationship with Taylor Swift, who has been attending many of his games this past season. The past week has seen speculation that Swift, who picked up the Grammy for album of the year last weekend, would also be at this Sunday\u2019s game. The singer is currently on the Japanese leg of her record-breaking Eras tour which wraps on Saturday. The Embassy of Japan in Washington DC issued a statement on 2 February reassuring fans that she would still have enough time to \u201ccomfortably\u201d make it to the game. Kelce\u2019s mother, Donna, said earlier this week: \u201cWe don\u2019t know until that day if she\u2019ll be coming or not.\u201d Travis has also said of Swift\u2019s attendance: \u201cShe is absolutely the number one fan right now. I love having her at every single game that she can make and we\u2019ll see.\u201d Usher said last November that he would try to involve Swift in his performance is she is there. \u201cI mean, she could be one person that I serenade,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, she could be a special guest.\u201d A recent study showed that American interest in the Super Bowl climbed by 169% from last year. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to have her a part of it,\u201d said the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, this week. \u201cObviously, it creates a buzz. It creates another group of young fans, particularly young women, that are interested in seeing why she is going to this game, why she is interested in this game.

Sarah Kane. Chris Ramsey? Heads turned late last year when the Royal Court in London announced a season of standup, programmed by big shot comedy producers Avalon, and featuring \u2013 among others \u2013 the co-host of the marital banter podcast Shagged. Married. Annoyed. At one of the UK\u2019s \u2013 the world\u2019s, even \u2013 most respected playhouses, renowned for the purity of its commitment to radical new drama, \u201cit\u2019s grim to see the cupboard looking so bare\u201d tweeted one critic. Grim, maybe. Unique? Far from it. Park theatre in London recently announced a new comedy strand to its programme, becoming the latest of many playhouses responding to trying times by reaching for the nearest comedian. That\u2019s happening for a variety of reasons, says its executive director, Catherine McKinney, although \u201cthere\u2019s no point pretending there isn\u2019t a financial undertone, because there is\u201d. Let\u2019s be clear: theatre is skint. Costs are up, subsidy is down, the old sources of funding are evaporating. This week, a report suggested that the Royal Court\u2019s literary department, responsible for the cultivation of new plays, was under threat. In such a climate, says McKinney, why wouldn\u2019t you turn to standup comedy? \u201cThe outlay is lower than for theatre. There isn\u2019t the need for a period of rehearsal, for complicated sets, all the things that go into making a full-scale theatre production. You can make it happen quickly and easily.\u201d And with attendance at many venues not yet back to pre-Covid levels, standup brings new audiences to theatre too \u2013 including many from sought-after demographics. The Park programmed previews last month of the year\u2019s hippest comedy show, Julia Masli\u2019s ha ha ha ha ha ha ha (before its Soho theatre run), and \u201cwe now know,\u201d says McKinney, \u201cthat 52% of that audience was new to us. We welcome them with open arms.\u201d McKinney worked at Soho before the Park, and acknowledges her ex-employer (as do others I speak to) as a pioneer in the space where comedy and theatre converge. But her key learning from them is that \u201cif a space is ever empty, everybody goes \u2018why? Put something in it, for God\u2019s sake!\u2019 So I\u2019ve come here and gone: we\u2019ve got these beautiful spaces, let\u2019s use them more.\u201d For McKinney, theatre can save itself not just by programming comedy, but by programming more activity full stop. Comedy programming is not happening at the expense of theatre, she insists: \u201cTheatre remains paramount for us.\u201d Comedy will happen in the gaps between, as will more family performances, community use and other ways to wring the most out of a building that\u2019s been under-used until now. Jon Thoday has been trying to get comedy into mainstream theatres for years. He\u2019s the head of Avalon, and the man responsible \u2013 way back when \u2013 for introducing standup to arenas. (That was with David Baddiel and Rob Newman; 30 years later, Baddiel is now part of Avalon\u2019s Royal Court lineup.) \u201cI remember once seeing Robin Williams at the Met,\u201d says Thoday, \u201cand there was something exciting about seeing him playing the opera house.\u201d Is that an anti-establishment excitement? \u201cA bit of that, yeah. I did many years ago contact the Royal Opera House in London to see if I could get that for a [standup] show. And they were very, very uninterested.\u201d So, always, were the Royal Court \u2013 until new artistic director David Byrne took over. Byrne worked with Avalon before on the fringe-turned-West-End hit Operation Mincemeat, and understands, according to Thoday, that standup is a subsection of, and not a threat to, the \u201cnew writing\u201d the Court exists to champion. For Thoday, the argument is simple. Many theatres \u2013 the London Palladium prominent among them \u2013 were built for variety, not exclusively for dramatic performance. It\u2019s a great experience for comedians to perform in them. And it\u2019s a simple case of supply and demand. \u201cTV is less interested in comedy now than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d he says, so he needs different avenues to build audiences for his mid-range acts: your John Kearns, your Pierre Novellies, your Ahir Shahs. \u201cThe Royal Court will have a mailing list, but it may not have people on it you\u2019d expect to go and see standup. But out of that list, some of them will want to come. So this brings our artists to wider audiences as well.\u201d So is this a win-win, for cash-strapped theatres and rising comedy acts? Or is this the thin end of a wedge that could prise theatre out of theatres \u2013 or at least, squeeze the space for the type of theatre that needs big sets, longer-running times, and a quality of attention you arguably don\u2019t get in venues that feel, and operate, like the Edinburgh fringe? The only concession Park theatre has made to accommodate standup, says McKinney, is that, in their Park90 space, \u201cwe\u2019re saying to theatre companies: \u2018Can you make sure your set can go back to the back wall, so we\u2019ve got a playing space [for standups]?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a little thing that everyone\u2019s happy to accommodate \u2013 not least because most of the Park90 companies are already making work in an ecology shaped by Edinburgh, work that has to be short, sharp and light on its feet. Thoday remembers, in the 1990s, \u201cwhen Edinburgh exploded, and there was a whole narrative about comedy killing theatre on the fringe. But I think it\u2019s been completely proved the opposite now.\u201d He points to the West End today, where Operation Mincemeat vies with the musical Six and The Play That Goes Wrong, and sees a theatre world in the fringe\u2019s image, where theatrical and comedic influences and talents rub up and intertwine. \u201cThe boundaries between the different arts are less hard than people think,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an old-fashioned view that it\u2019s the end of days that the Royal Court has got standup comedy in it. I think it\u2019s the beginning of days. It would be great if the Court was more supported by subsidy. But it\u2019s also nice that there\u2019s an artform that can help other artforms survive in difficult times.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-09", "section": "Stage", "author": "Brian Logan", "id": 375, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/402f1d8daa4462e4d92b155d0e975fd8a24dadeb/0_989_7455_4475/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Want to try barely there makeup?

I meet lots of women like this. Foundation is a bit like denim: trends can dictate whatever they like, but if you\u2019re someone who feels best in full coverage base and/or skinny jeans, there\u2019s a good chance you always will. Even if you\u2019re curious about the bare-ish makeup trend, unless you\u2019re like Pamela Anderson and look glorious either way, the thought of a make-under can be alarming. If you fall into the former camp, you do you without apology. If you\u2019re in the latter, there are products to make the process less drastic. My favourite launch of the year so far is Chanel\u2019s Les Beiges Healthy Winter Glow Primer (\u00a348). This is, in effect, a light-reflecting skin laminator. It instantly creates a smoother, plumper-looking complexion with the glow of good health. It can be worn alone, but any makeup applied thereafter benefits from a standing start. Weighed down by winter lurgy, I\u2019ve spent much of the past week using this (in the Icy Beige shade \u2013 there are three) to fake better times, and it works. Sculpted By Aimee is an accessible, more affordable brand with ambitions to make makeup less intimidating. Its HydraTint Moisturising Tinted Serum (\u00a323) is a great place for the bare-faced to scale up and for a full-face to pare back. This fluid squeeze-it-out-and-slap-it-on is foolproof and one of my favourite products in recent months. For a skincare-makeup hybrid with a fraction of a foundation\u2019s coverage, it still packs a punch, unifying mildly patchy, uneven skin tone and perking up grey, central heating-parched skin. It doesn\u2019t replace your skincare, but its extra layer of ungreasy moisture is particularly welcome in this frequently foul weather. Makeup By Mario\u2019s Soft Sculpt Transforming Skin Enhancer (\u00a335) is uniquely brilliant and beloved across genders.

Buoyed by the memory of generously warm springs \u2013 like that of 2020 \u2013 we could be forgiven for being optimistic and sow seeds in the hope that this coming spring will be just as ideal for our early crops. But British weather is unpredictable, so why plant seeds now when those sown later will probably fare better? This is true for the vast number of crops that I\u2019ll be sowing when the daffodils are in full bloom. But there are notable exceptions \u2013 and one is the aubergine. This vegetable was at the heart of the Mauritian cooking I grew up on, and so came to associate it with warmer climates, but it\u2019s very possible \u2013 and very satisfying! \u2013 to grow aubergines in the UK. Aubergine seeds ought to be started in February, as this gives them the best chance of reaching the point of harvest before autumn arrives. Like their fellow nightshades, the tomato and the chilli, aubergines need warmth to germinate, so start your seeds in a propagator, on a heated seedling mat or in an airing cupboard. But once they germinate, it\u2019s essential to position your seedlings where they can get as much sunlight as possible. Sadly, my greenhouse is far too cold and my windowsills aren\u2019t bright enough, so I use grow lights to ensure my seedlings don\u2019t become weak and leggy. Since it isn\u2019t possible for every grower to provide these conditions, I\u2019m a big fan of outsourcing this task to the pros and ordering plug plants. Aubergines need generous watering, nutritious soil or compost and warmth to prosper, so once my plants are large enough I give them a coveted spot in my small greenhouse. They can be grown outside, but only if you have a sunny, protected spot for them. And dwarf varieties can be grown in large containers. Come the start of summer, they\u2019ll hit their stride and produce ample leaves, soon followed by pretty lilac flowers heavy with pollen. They need the assistance of pollinators for those flowers to transform into fruit, so, just in case, I mist them and use a small paintbrush to move their pollen from stamen to stigma. Aubergines are ready to harvest when they\u2019re plump and their skin is shiny \u2013 usually from midsummer onwards \u2013 though take care as their spines are surprisingly sharp and tricky to spot. I love to grow the variety \u201cLong Purple\u201d, as they\u2019re most like the ones my parents grew up eating.

Her best friend, Izzy, worries about how criminals could use it, while Cassie thinks they should just enjoy this amazing freedom. But Izzy was right to worry: the Book of Doors is just one of a small number of magical books, each with a different power, and although not many know they exist, some collectors won\u2019t stop at murder to get what they want. What begins like a joyous daydream soon becomes a suspenseful thriller. It\u2019s a truly magical book: exciting, intricately plotted and emotionally compelling. Shigidi and the Brass Head of Obalufon by Wole Talabi (Gollancz, \u00a322) The first novel from the Nigerian author of award-winning short stories is set in two worlds: ours, and the spirit side, where ancient gods have modernised into corporate board members who employ lesser spirits to deal with prayers and petitions. Shigidi, a minor god of nightmares, falls in love with the sexy, mysterious Nneoma, a succubus who feeds on human souls, and convinces him to be her partner in the freelance life. But his employer, the Orisha Spirit Company, won\u2019t release him unless he steals back a precious sacred object from the British Museum. With their supernatural powers, the partners expect it to be an easy heist \u2013 until they tangle with London\u2019s own spirit guardians. Moving back and forth in time, and between Lagos, London, Singapore and Algeria, this is a vivid, entertaining tale of love, power and revenge. Red Side Story by Jasper Fforde (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320) The long-awaited sequel to 2010\u2019s Shades of Grey continues the story set in a country that used to be Britain \u2013 before Something Happened. Society now operates on a hierarchical, colour-based system, where everyone\u2019s place and role are determined by the range of colours they are able to see. Eddie and Jane belong to hues of red and green: strictly prohibited from marriage, and now awaiting trial for a murder they did not commit. No one is allowed to question the many strict rules, no matter how absurd. But Eddie and Jane are in love, smart and curious, willing to run any risk to find out the truth about their world. Cleverly constructed, with engaging characters and lots of good jokes, this sparkling Wizard of Oz-inspired fantasy is the second book in an intended trilogy, and one of the quirkiest dystopias ever imagined. Past Crimes by Jason Pinter (Severn House, \u00a321.99) The first venture into science fiction by a well-regarded crime writer is set in the 2040s, when Americans are spending most of their waking hours in an immersive virtual reality network known as Earth+. The popularity of true crime as entertainment has grown exponentially, with new tech allowing total sensory engagement. Subscribers to the simulations produced by entertainment company Past Crimes have the option of being not merely observers but players in famous historic crimes. Cassie West, the widow of the man held responsible for an outbreak of mass suicides and murders known as the Blight, is probably the only person in the world who believes the real culprit got away with it. She thinks she\u2019s found evidence that he\u2019s planning to strike again, with a massacre timed to coincide with the release of the highly anticipated Blight simulation. But will anyone believe her? A tense, unputdownable near-future thriller, chillingly believable about some of the drawbacks of life lived increasingly in non-physical spaces. The City of Stardust by Georgia Summers (Hodderscape, \u00a320) The Everly family is cursed: for generations, their youngest has been taken by the terrifying, ageless Penelope in payment of a long-ago debt. Violet is the last of the line, since her mother vanished on a quest to break the curse; unless she returns, Violet will be sacrificed instead. As the deadline approaches, newly adult Violet goes on her own quest. She looks to Penelope\u2019s assistant, Aleksander, for help, knowing she shouldn\u2019t trust him, but tempted by his stories of another world, where he lives in a city of scholar-magicians.

As the mist cleared over the loch each morning, stunning views emerged, creating what my partner would refer to as a \u201csoul spa\u201d. With our holidays usually jam-packed with activities, it was refreshing to change gear and just take relaxing woodland walks amid nature and to recharge the batteries whenever we felt like it. Greg Marshall Bathing \u2013 in a forest and in a tub, Wye Valley Last summer my family and I visited Forest Retreats, near Tintern, overlooking the Wye valley, for three nights\u2019 glamping in one of its luxury yurts. We had an amazing time, relaxing in the outdoor eco spa and taking part in a yoga class. It is a beautiful setting that is a superb base for forest bathing too, but mostly it\u2019s just a really calming place to spend some time in the outdoors. Jo Grim Swimming and nature near York The seasonal Elements mini retreats hosted near York by Laura Fazio were a real highlight of 2023 for me. The retreats combine yoga, breath work, wild swimming and a campfire brunch followed by a guided meditation. The riverside location is perfect for appreciating nature \u2013 I\u2019ll always remember spotting the electric blue streak of a kingfisher after a rather splendid dip. I leave feeling so rejuvenated and full of gratitude. Fern Under the bridge, Bristol You don\u2019t need to spend money for meditation and relaxation.

Zoe Bliss in Essex It was a real pleasure to stay at the Glass House (rooms from \u00a3240 per person per night) retreat in Essex, in the countryside near Upminster. I enjoyed yoga, walks, swimming and meditation, and brilliant, rich facials, which left my skin glowing. The purpose-built modern spa also offers cryotherapy in its cold therapy chamber, though I didn\u2019t try it. The place offers lovely plant-based food, full of good greens. Best of all, the staff were so helpful and friendly. Caroline G Winning tip: cabin solitude in the Scottish Borders I searched online at Airbnb and booked a stunning and simple log cabin on the edge of the pretty hamlet of Abbey Saint Bathans, in the Scottish Borders, about 40 minutes\u2019 drive from Berwick-upon-Tweed. It felt remarkably remote and peaceful with gorgeous walks on the doorstep, with a mix of forests, hills, meadows, crystal clear rivers clean enough for a dip, and a beautifully simple yet comfortable space for one or two people to unplug and relax. The cabin is big enough for a yoga mat, as is the outside terrace. We went for a break in 2022 there, and for tranquillity and peace nowhere else has come close.

The mysteries of adulthood and the loss of innocence are all wrapped up in a summer holiday in Turkey taken by 11-year-old Sophie (a cheeky, adorable Frankie Corio) and her dad Calum \u2013 a superbly layered performance by Paul Mescal. Amid the lazy days by the hotel pool, all-inclusive buffets, boat trips and excursions to ancient ruins, Calum\u2019s hidden melancholy surfaces. It\u2019s mitigated by the tenderness and comfort of his relationship with his daughter, but there\u2019s something gnawing at him we struggle to fathom, in a superbly made tale with all the warmth of a tightly held memory. Sunday 11 February, 10pm, BBC Two *** The Falling Our cinematic introduction to the great Florence Pugh was in Carol Morley\u2019s dreamlike, sensual 2014 work. She plays charismatic girls\u2019 school pupil Abbie \u2013 an object of envy to her peers and teachers, even best friend Lydia (Maisie Williams). But when Abbie has a sudden and inexplicable seizure, it sets off a chain reaction of mass fits among the other students. Is it rebellion, collective grief or just overactive teen hormones? Edging towards folk horror, and with nods to Picnic at Hanging Rock and the dislocating films of Nicolas Roeg, it\u2019s an unsettling experience. Sunday 11 February, 11.35pm, BBC Two *** Frost/Nixon Adapted from Peter \u201cThe Crown\u201d Morgan\u2019s play, Ron Howard\u2019s film tells the fascinating true story of the 1977 interview British talkshow host David Frost secured with the disgraced former US president Richard Nixon. Michael Sheen plays Frost as an ambitious, self-preening media operator desperate to become a success in the US again. Frank Langella is Nixon, bitter about his downfall and keen to rehabilitate himself. The battle of wits and wills between the performer and the politician makes for sparky drama. Sunday 11 February, 5.55pm, Sky Cinema Greats *** Past Lives Celine Song\u2019s wonderful, wistful movie asks the question: what if your first love was the greatest love of your life? That\u2019s the doubt facing Nora (Greta Lee), who moved from South Korea to Canada when she was 12 and lost touch with the boy she\u2019d got close to, Hae-sung (Teo Yoo). Twelve years later, they reconnect through a series of video calls \u2013 but without being able to meet in person, where can the relationship go? Song\u2019s film sidesteps melodrama to ponder the sometimes painful weight of history on the present, and the decisions we make about who to love. SW Thursday 15 February, Netflix *** This Is Me \u2026 Now: A Love Story As befits someone as practised in the acting world as the pop realm, Jennifer Lopez\u2019s new album is accompanied by an ambitious feature film. Helmed by music video director Dave Myers, it combines tracks from This Is Me \u2026 Now with autobiographical drama and epic scenes of colourful, intricately choreographed fantasy. Cameos from her new spouse Ben Affleck, Post Malone, Sofia Vergara and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson give a flavour of the broad sweep of J-Lo\u2019s interests. Friday 16 February, Prime Video *** Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One There is no stopping Tom Cruise. The seventh instalment in the big bucks espionage series is largely identical to the previous six but is almost embarrassingly easy to like. With imaginative action sequences (the train scenes are vertiginous), extreme stuntwork, often by Cruise himself, desirable global locations (Paris, Rome, the Orient Express), convoluted plotting \u2013 he and his rogue agents basically fight the internet \u2013 plus new faces in Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, it\u2019s exhilarating business as usual for the Cruiser. Friday 16 February, 11.15am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** The Thing John Carpenter\u2019s entertainingly gruesome 1982 horror remake has the alien that invades an Antarctic research station able to imitate any life form (rather than just being a lumbering man in a creature suit, as in its predecessor The Thing from Another World). Paranoia reigns as the staff don\u2019t know who\u2019s infected and who\u2019s not \u2013 but Kurt Russell\u2019s helicopter pilot MacReady is certain it isn\u2019t him and tries to make a survival plan. Cold war-style \u201creds under the bed\u201d fears mingle with Agatha Christie\u2019s And Then There Were None as the mutating ET picks the men off one by one.

But in terms of screen content, 2023 was no ordinary period \u2013 particularly for Australian television. There was the occasional lemon (looking at you, Warnie) but I can\u2019t recall another year since streaming took off that provided so many well-produced shows in such close succession. Let\u2019s start with productions recognised by the Aactas. Among the 12 titles nominated for best drama series and best miniseries, all bar one (Bay of Fires) are good, solid shows and two are excellent. The good and solid include the beautifully shot The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart, the highly ambitious domestic violence drama Safe Home, the doomsday cult thriller The Clearing and the rousing, if a little patchy musical In Our Blood. The excellent ones should be watched post-haste if you haven\u2019t seen them. Revolving around a TV newsroom in the 80s, The Newsreader is a class act: the storylines are engaging, the characters well-drawn, the performances top-notch \u2013 including Anna Torv and Sam Reid as romantically attached news anchors. Also up there with the best is Love Me, about a middle-class Melbourne family navigating a series of romantic and personal challenges. It too features a rock-solid cast including Hugo Weaving, Bojana Novakovic, William Lodder and Heather Mitchell. Moving on to the nominations for best narrative comedy series. Two are absolute gold. One is Deadloch, a wickedly entertaining series created and written by Kates McCartney and McLennan that rightly turned heads, injecting fresh blood into the police procedural. The plot involves a boisterous, decorum-breaking detective (Madeleine Sami) who helps a small town cop (Kate Box) get to the bottom of a grisly murder or two. Another \u2013 which actually arrived in December 2022 \u2013 is Colin From Accounts, a spritzy romcom created, written by and starring Harriet Dyer and Patrick Brammall. It begins with a meet-cute bringing together Dyer and Brammall\u2019s characters: a student doctor and a brewery owner respectively. My colleague Lucy Mangan liked this delightful series even more than I did, dishing out five stars just on the basis of the first two episodes. Another quality series to score an Aacta nod \u2013 for best children\u2019s program \u2013 is the under-appreciated Crazy Fun Park, a sassy young adult production with a memorable central location: a dilapidated amusement park populated by ghosts. But what about the stand-outs that the Aactas didn\u2019t recognise? Top of the list is The Messenger: a surreal, noirish story about a teenage cab driver (William McKenna) who receives mysterious playing cards inscribed with addresses. At each of them there\u2019s some kind of problem for him to solve. And lest we forget the fabulous The Artful Dodger: a zippy Dickensian comedy that relocates the titular character (of Oliver Twist fame) to Australia, now working as a surgeon. Going into 2024, the big question is whether this glut of quality content can continue. Early signs are positive, even if streamers have been spending less on local content. The year got off to a cracking start with the second season of The Tourist, re-uniting Jamie Dorman\u2019s amnesiac protagonist and the affable Constable Helen Chambers (Danielle Macdonald), who are now romantically entwined. As Leila Latif wrote: \u201cThe twists come thick and fast: some funny, some cruel, almost all ludicrous.\u201d Meanwhile, Boy Swallows Universe did a mostly great job adapting Trent Dalton\u2019s acclaimed novel of the same name. But the best of the year so far is the megachurch drama Prosper, which I smashed through in no time, greedily gobbling up its sordid twists and turns. Phew!

She had made \u201csome money\u201d buying cryptocurrency and wanted to use it to get into the property market. She felt there were two options she could afford: a studio apartment in the city; or teaming up with a friend to split the cost of a house in a regional area. Desperate for extra space after the pandemic, she chose the latter, and the pair bought a little seaside fixer-upper cottage. They planned to do some light renovations, then live there together. Sara was excited about buying with one of her closest friends, someone she\u2019d known for over a decade \u2013 \u201clonger than any relationship I\u2019ve had\u201d. But things unravelled quickly. The renovations blew out, becoming far more expensive than either had anticipated. Interest rates started their rapid ascent, adding extra financial pressure. Sara began to feel that she was doing more renovation work than her buying partner, creating a sense of imbalance. And they started to clash on decisions, big and small. \u201cWe\u2019re getting into stupid fights about what floorboards we\u2019re going to get because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s always like, \u2018we can\u2019t afford that\u2019,\u201d Sara says. She assumed years of friendship meant they would make a good team. \u201cAnd then you find out through the process of trying to build a house together that maybe you\u2019re not actually that compatible.\u201d At the start of the process the pair paid a lawyer to write out some terms, including what they\u2019d do if one party wanted to sell \u2013 \u201cas a friendship protector,\u201d Sara says. But \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in the clauses that says you can\u2019t be difficult\u201d. They\u2019re now close to finishing the renovations. But after all this, do they even want to live there anymore? \u201cNot really, no,\u201d Sara says. \u201cSo many things have changed.\u201d Sara and her friend aren\u2019t alone in pooling their money to get on the property ladder. Often, those looking to buy with a friend will use a tenants in common agreement \u2013 a legal structure where each party has a defined share of a property they\u2019re purchasing (rather than an automatic 50/50 split). Victoria Divine, a mortgage broker, podcaster and author of Property with She\u2019s on the Money, says lately she puts together a tenants in common agreement \u201cevery two weeks or so\u201d. The incentives for buddying up to buy are obvious. \u201cBuying property is getting harder and harder,\u201d Divine says. She points out that property prices have far outstripped wage growth, putting home ownership out of reach for most people on a single salary. This means those who still want to buy property have to \u201clook for alternate ways of doing it\u201d. \u201cAnd buying property with other people, whether that\u2019s a friend or a family member, can obviously get you into home ownership faster.\u201d When it works well, buying with friends or family can be a foot into the market, or a way to afford something with better capital growth potential, building equity that can be used on a forever home later. And it\u2019s not just young people who are doing it. Divine says she\u2019s seen a number of older women buy together: \u201cSingle mums getting in with another single mum and cohabitating and living their best life.\u201d But it\u2019s \u201cso important to choose the right person,\u201d Divine says \u2013 because there are a raft of ways it can go wrong. While banks are generally happy to lend to those buying as tenants in common, many will require the two parties act as guarantor for each other, which means being on the hook for the other party\u2019s debt if they stop paying. A co-owner defaulting on their mortgage could affect the other\u2019s credit rating, and because all owners need to agree to a sale, co-owners can end up trapped if one party wants to sell but the other refuses. Or, as Sara\u2019s experience shows, it might simply erode a relationship through a thousand smaller squabbles. Some worst-case scenarios can be planned for through a legal document called a cohabitation agreement, Divine says. These stipulate terms for a purchase \u2013 for instance, planning for what might happen if one person can no longer meet their financial commitment, or simply laying out exit strategies. (This is the legally-binding, but not personally effective \u201cfriendship protector\u201d Sara speaks of). Hamish Landreth, a financial consultant at Prosperity Wealth Advisers, says that buying property via a company or a trust is another way to structure co-ownership, and allows for more flexibility to change ownership percentages in the future, if one party wants out. Of course, buying with a partner isn\u2019t foolproof, either \u2013 couples break-up. And many of the legal implications are the same either way. \u201cBut the difference is when you\u2019re with a partner, you\u2019re going through a shared set of circumstances,\u201d Landreth says. \u201cWith someone else, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re going to have different circumstances. One person might suddenly need to move overseas for work. In a couple, you\u2019re making that decision together.\u201d Or one person might simply want to move out. That\u2019s what happened to Hayley*, who bought a property with her two older sisters when they were all in their 20s. After a few years living together, Hayley\u2019s eldest sister had a baby and wanted her own home, so she sold her share in the property to their middle sister. The structure of their loan meant that Hayley became her middle sister\u2019s guarantor, \u201cfor a huge amount of money\u201d. Hayley later met her own husband. When the couple wanted to buy a house together, Hayley discovered her options were severely restricted by her sister\u2019s debt. Going in, she did not consider this possibility, and it made for a stressful experience. \u201cWe were all just frustrated \u2026 really bound together and financially stuck,\u201d she says. \u201cYou buy in your mid-20s and suddenly everyone changes in different ways \u2013 suddenly one sister is married with kids and doesn\u2019t want to live in that area, and another sister moved overseas.\u201d Their goals no longer aligned, she says. The trio eventually sold. But it remains a family sore spot, especially for Hayley\u2019s middle sister, who took on too much debt to buy the eldest out. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a taboo topic,\u201d Hayley says. \u201cLike, it really hurts.\u201d However, Hayley doesn\u2019t regret the purchase. She and her sisters bought over a decade ago, and getting into the market early eventually benefitted her financially, despite the painful period. It\u2019s also possible to have a perfectly smooth experience buying as tenants in common. Deb* and her best friend bought an apartment together in 2018, and moved from Sydney to Melbourne to live there. Their only contract was a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d around what they would do if one party needed to sell. Five years on, Deb\u2019s friend is planning to move back to Sydney to be closer to her parents; but she has given Deb a couple of years notice. This means Deb has time to prepare for buying her friend out, which she intends to do. \u201cMy story is probably one of the better ones,\u201d Deb says. She and her friend had known each other for years, and travelled together \u2013 \u201ctravelling really does make or break friendships\u201d \u2013 so the communication has been straightforward. Plus, in the current interest rate environment, Deb is relieved to only have half a mortgage to worry about. \u201cI do feel sorry for families on one income that have a million-dollar mortgage.\u201d And would she have been able to buy at all without teaming up with her friend? \u201cGod no,\u201d Deb says. Meanwhile Sara feels bound, emotionally and financially. \u201cMy money is just all tied up in this house,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the thing people don\u2019t realise is we\u2019re effectively de facto in this \u2026 we have our own mortgages, but we\u2019re so tied.\u201d It has been a first-home buyer\u2019s baptism of fire. \u201cI\u2019m someone who didn\u2019t come from money, but I suddenly came into money. In a moment of vulnerability or naivety, I got swept up in this idea of buying a home because it was somewhere for me to put my money at that moment,\u201d she says. \u201cBut \u2026 I put myself in a pretty tricky spot.\u201d The contract the pair signed did lay out an exit strategy \u2013 if one party wants to sell, the other gets first dibs to buy them out. If that isn\u2019t possible, the pair have to sell. Given neither has the funds to buy the other out, Sara thinks they will probably end up selling the property far sooner than they anticipated. She just has to hold out until then. \u201cI guess the benefit is that it\u2019s not forever, and I still have money that\u2019s secure, and we\u2019ll have a nice place eventually,\u201d Sara says. \u201cThat\u2019s more than a lot of people get.\u201d *Names have been changed", "date": "2024-02-09", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Katie Cunningham", "id": 383, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eba9b4809d76d37030827084db6c08888f1f0d9e/131_519_5824_3494/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Churches must diversify and adapt to stop the rot | Letters", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/churches-must-diversify-and-adapt-to-stop-the-rot", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.048, "neu": 0.662, "pos": 0.291, "compound": 0.9986}, "body": "Your editorial (2 February) was right to highlight the importance of using churches as \u201clocal anchor institutions\u201d and to praise the National Churches Trust report calling for an expansion of the secular uses of church buildings. In Droxford, a small Hampshire village, we have rescued our Grade I Norman church from the brink of ruin to become a thriving community hub. The church now hosts Wilfrid\u2019s \u2013 a volunteer-run cafe open five days a week, a new bell-ringing team, a computer club, and a growing heritage centre. Thanks to the popularity of the cafe and other activities, more than \u00a310,000 was distributed last year to the local community, with over half going towards church and churchyard projects. We could not have achieved this outcome without investment in the church building, first to make it safe, and second to build an annexe for a kitchen and toilets. Our vision was backed by major grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and a range of secular bodies, including Hampshire county council, and numerous small donors. Sadly, the NCT was not among them because it insisted that our lead architect had to be \u201cconservation accredited\u201d, despite his relevant experience. An alliance of church officials and architects on the diocesan advisory committee also turned down our project, voting to preserve the status quo rather than adapt the building to serve the needs of the community. The success of our project despite these setbacks shows that there is a way forward to preserve our church heritage for the benefit of all. There is still work to be done to persuade the architectural profession and the church authorities that churches must be permitted to adapt to serve their communities in the 21st century. I hope that the NCT is now ready to lead the way. John Symes Trustee and former chair, Friends of Droxford Church \u2022 I was alarmed to see the Guardian supporting a report published by the National Churches Trust calling for \u201cat least \u00a350 million\u201d a year of public funding to be ringfenced to maintain churches. It is true that some churches have historical, architectural, cultural and social value, and so there may be a public interest in maintaining them. But it should be noted that Church of England, likely to be the main recipient of government funding, holds significant wealth. Church Commissioners for England, the charity that manages the C of E\u2019s funds, has assets valued at \u00a310.3bn. An unnecessary burden on the taxpayer should be avoided where those responsible for maintaining places of worship have the available assets to fund their own maintenance and repairs. Stephen Evans Chief executive officer, National Secular Society \u2022 What a great shame that some of our most magnificent buildings are struggling for life in these times of austerity. Although not a practising Christian, I always love to spend time in churches when I\u2019m visiting places around the nation. Many, of course, have been converted to other uses. If the rot is to stop, they need to diversify, just like farmers. There\u2019s a long tradition of brewing and ale use in our ecclesiastical heritage, and today many churches are benefiting from the support of beer festivals. Last year a York Camra ran one in St Lawrence\u2019s church, second only in size here to York Minster. We paid a significant rent, which is helping to enable improvements and repairs. We need events like this to make wider social use of underutilised buildings. Karl Smith York \u2022 It\u2019s time that the medieval churches in the UK were renationalised. Privatised by the government in the 1530s, they were handed out to the friends and families of the establishment. Once back in state hands, their upkeep can be paid for through the rent raised from any organisation that would like to use them, be it a soft play company, the Post Office or the Church of England.

While everyone around me started lacing up trainers for their \u201cdaily hour of exercise\u201d, I was unable to jog to the end of the road without pain flaring up in both of my knee joints for days. I honestly believed that I would never run again. And after an MRI scan on my knee revealed I had \u201cshallow grooves\u201d in which the patella slipped around, a specialist told me to think about taking up a lower-impact sport like swimming instead. \u201cYou\u2019re not built for running,\u201d a specialist told me. \u201cSo maybe just don\u2019t do it.\u201d \u201cOh really, he told you that?\u201d says physio Uzo Ehiogu. Ehiogu is the founder of Inside Edge physiotherapy in Birmingham, and a specialist in musculoskeletal issues for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, as well as being an accredited strength and conditioning coach. As someone who recognises the benefits of running \u2013 for both physical and mental health \u2013 he is not the kind of person to tell someone to quit an exercise they enjoy unless it really is essential. And the good news is most runners can take simple steps to reduce their chances of being struck down with the dreaded runner\u2019s knee. But what is runner\u2019s knee? Ehiogu admits that it is a bit of a woolly phrase, a catch-all term for any niggles at the front of the knee. \u201cBut broadly speaking, most clinicians are referring to patellofemoral joint pain. This is a condition in which the kneecap and its associated structures become overloaded.\u201d An overload injury is likely to develop slowly over time. Unlike, say, a sprained ankle, there is no sudden moment of trauma where something important tears. This is certainly how it was with me. In 2018, I challenged myself to get my 5km time down to under 20 minutes. That meant a steep incline in intense running. When my knees hurt a little the next day, I viewed it simply as inevitable soreness, and ploughed on with intense interval sessions. I was making a typical mistake. \u201cOften people will feel sore the next day, then get back on it a couple of days later and reinjure the same tissue that is trying to repair itself,\u201d says Ehiogu. \u201cIf you keep doing this injury-repair cycle, eventually what happens is you have a knee that\u2019s persistently annoyed. Things can become quite recalcitrant if you keep doing this. So my first advice is, if you feel pain, back off. Two weeks is probably about the time that you need to calm it down. So rather than running maybe go to the gym and do some upper body weights or cycle. If it settles down, add some sensible progressive increases and you might not need to see a physio.\u201d Just be careful not to start back up where you were at before. \u201cDrop whatever you were doing before it started by about 25% to 30%. Then gradually increase training by about 10% per week,\u201d says Ehiogu. Reader: I didn\u2019t do any of this. Determined to complete my quest, I ignored my pain and, by the time I finally sneaked under the 20-minute mark in the summer of 2019, I was used to hobbling around in pain for 48 hours afterwards. People who do what I did risk permanently damaging their knees, wearing through the cartilage and turning your runner\u2019s knee into a bone stress injury. Luckily I hadn\u2019t gone that far. But I was in a position where simply resting for a few weeks wasn\u2019t helping. I needed physio intervention, which I finally embarked upon 18 months after I was forced off the road, with a fantastic physiotherapist called Fred Manning. It was a slow process, tailored to my individual situation, but it was also a rewarding one. We started with gentle squats performed while supporting my back against a wall, which was about all I could stand pain wise, and moved towards gradually harder tasks until I was performing 20 single-leg squats with virtually no pain at all. What I loved about my physio wasn\u2019t simply that he prescribed the correct treatment path, but that he was able to describe what was going on in my body in a way that made sense and therefore motivated me to put in the time to fix it. \u201cMy athletes say the same to me,\u201d says Ehiogu, who has worked with runners, tennis players and soldiers. \u201cThey want to know, \u2018OK, why am I doing this? How does it work? How long will it take to get better?\u2019 Being able to explain those three things makes a big difference.\u201d What worked for me might not necessarily be the correct path for others suffering from runner\u2019s knee, but Ehiogu says there are some simple exercises we can all do to build lower body strength and keep some of the pressure off our knees. \u201cBasically you want to increase muscle strength around the quadriceps, the glutes and the calf [see examples below]. Those three muscles are really important because they\u2019re your antigravitational muscles.\u201d Flexibility, as well as strength, is important, and Ehiogu also suggests stretching the hip flexors, quads and calves because that will help you move into the best possible position for running \u2013 what\u2019s known as the triple extension: \u201cWhere the hips are in extension, the knees are in extension and they\u2019re pushing off from the toes.\u201d So how often should we stretch? \u201cObviously, the more stretching you do, the better,\u201d he says. \u201cBut most people are time-poor so it\u2019s probably more realistic to say stretch every time you run \u2013 and afterwards, not before. Try to do two or three sets of between 30 and 40 seconds on each one.\u201d Perhaps the most fascinating thing I discovered during my journey back to running was the relationship between pain and tissue damage. Although I was getting burning knee pain whenever I tried to restart training, my physio pointed out that it was unlikely I was doing untold damage to my joints in the space of 500 metres. Rather, my brain had been trained to set off a warning system whenever it felt any significant loading on the knees. Part of my rehabilitation involved teaching my central nervous system to realise that certain movements were safe again \u2013 softly hopping, for instance, or jumping off a step. \u201cPain is essentially a prehistoric alarm system that says: \u2018There\u2019s damage!\u2019\u201d says Ehiogu. \u201cBut if I am seeing you three or four months into an injury, and the scans say that, actually, the cartilage underneath is fine, the bone is fine, then the pain is probably just because your nervous system is hypersensitive. You\u2019ve had ongoing symptoms for such a long period that your brain is now starting to develop a memory of them.\u201d All of which is to say, best not to let things get as bad as I did. Of course, there are some other simple things you can do to help your knees out. Making sure your trainers are in good shape is one. Everyone runs differently, so go on \u201cfeel\u201d rather than mileage, says Ehiogu \u2013 when they start to lose their springy bounce it is probably time to upgrade. Having your gait analysed so you buy the correct trainers will also help. As will running on softer ground, rather than pavement, and not overdoing the steep hills. As for trying to spend your way out of knee pain? Well, I\u2019ve been there and I\u2019ve got the supplements, massage guns and rolls of kinesiology tape to show for it. None of these things are necessarily bad, says Ehiogu, but they should be viewed as complementary therapies alongside the hard work \u2013 they won\u2019t magically fix your problems. There is no getting around the fact that running has a high impact on our joints \u2013 and especially the knees. And because we all have different biomechanics, predicting who is going to get knee pain, and when it will strike, isn\u2019t always possible. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s going to come down to: what is your body willing to tolerate at this moment in time?\u201d says Ehiogu. Four years on from thinking I would never run again, I have achieved things that weren\u2019t possible before thanks to the improved muscle strength supporting my knees. Whereas previously I would have had to stop around the 12km mark due to a tight IT band (another injury that can affect the knees), these days I can run half marathons without so much of a twinge. But I\u2019m not complacent and know that running injuries are always lurking around the corner if we don\u2019t take care of our joints. Nobody is a perfect runner, after all. \u201cIf you look at runners around the world and compare them to what is the textbook, ideal way to run, there\u2019s always a bit of deviation off that,\u201d says Ehiogu. \u201cAs people start to fatigue, that deviation starts to increase. So even the best runners in the world deviate from what is the best way to run.\u201d And, as physios like Ehiogu show, even some of the most middling runners can overcome their knee problems and get back on the track. Stretch this: Uzo Ehiogu\u2019s strengthening exercises Assuming you are not injured, these exercises should help build muscles that support the knees while running. Calf raises \u201cVery simple, just move up on to your toes then slowly back down. Start off with double-leg calf raises \u2013 using both legs at the same time. Once you can do three sets of 10 repetitions with ease then you can progress this exercise to single-leg raises, which places all of your bodyweight on to each leg.\u201d Weighted squats \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have a barbell across your back to do these. A kettlebell or a weight will do. Sometimes I even tell people to put books in a bag and just hold on to it. These will target the quads and the glutes. Again, when you can do three sets of 10 repetitions then it\u2019s time to progress by increasing the weight.\u201d Side-lying leg lifts \u201cLie on your side with your bottom leg slightly bent for balance, then raise the other one slowly up and down. Try to stop the leg that you raise from creeping forward to ensure you target the gluteal muscles. When three sets of 10 repetitions start to feel easy use an elastic exercise band to make it harder.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-10", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Tim Jonze", "id": 387, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/81bb1af499dca6d650a27f23993ffafcfb5f354d/0_40_4694_2817/500.jpg"}, {"title": "This is how we do it: \u2018We schedule sex: every three days \u2013 to Madonna\u2019s Hanky Panky\u2019 ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/10/this-is-how-we-do-it-we-schedule-sex-every-three-days-to-madonnas-hanky-panky", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.088, "neu": 0.653, "pos": 0.26, "compound": 0.9977}, "body": "Melissa, 64 I have insecurities about my own body, so sex is not as straightforwardly pleasurable for me Don and I love routine. We have had a pre-dinner drink at the exact same time \u2013 6.20pm \u2013 almost every night of our 40-year marriage. Sex is also scheduled: we do it once every three days. I\u2019ve made a playlist called Sexy, which I put on to set the mood. The songs, like our sex positions, rarely vary. We might start with a little foreplay, to the tune of Etta James\u2019s I Just Want to Make Love to You, and finish in missionary, to Madonna\u2019s Hanky Panky. Don would ideally like to do it three times a day, like we did in our 20s; so doing it once every three days is our compromise. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t desire Don: he still has the body of an athlete. But I have insecurities about my own body, so sex is not as straightforwardly pleasurable for me. I am muscular, with slim hips, and have always felt unfeminine. Sometimes I\u2019m unable to orgasm because I become fixated on the marks childbirth has left on my body, or my lack of breasts. For most of our relationship, I\u2019ve made sure every time we have sex I am covered by a sheet. When I feel particularly consumed with body worries, I try to get myself back into the mood by resorting to fantasy: while Don and I are having sex I\u2019ll picture other women in my mind, with more perfect figures, to distract me from my own. If we move swiftly through a series of tried-and-tested positions I stay focused on sensation, and don\u2019t worry so much about the way I look. I think that\u2019s partly why I like scheduling sex, and sticking to our routine. When I know exactly what to expect, I am less likely to become self-conscious. My favourite sort of sex is fast and furious. Don is always very loving and reassuring. He is constantly complimenting my breasts and asking me to do strip-teases, although I usually only relent on anniversaries. Recently though, I\u2019ve started doing things I didn\u2019t think were possible for me. Last summer he did a bit of sunbathing in the garden, naked. I surprised myself by joining him. The other day I caught sight of my bottom in the mirror and thought: not bad for 64. There\u2019s a kind of relief in getting older. To expect perfection at this age would be ridiculous. Letting go of some insecurity has made sex newly carefree: I\u2019m still scheduling, but no longer hiding under the sheet. Don, 64 I will often think to myself: only two more sleeps before sex Melissa and I sleep in separate bedrooms because we are light sleepers, but every morning she comes into my bed for a cuddle. The current rule is that once every three mornings that cuddle will turn sexual. I genuinely enjoy the excitement of counting down the days: I will often think to myself, \u201conly two more sleeps before sex\u201d. What we actually do in bed is fairly unadventurous, but I love it. It\u2019s easiest for Melissa to orgasm if she stimulates herself while we are having sex in the missionary position, so we always end up doing that. I enjoy performing oral sex on Melissa, and would like to bring her to orgasm that way, but she has never orgasmed orally. I deliberately don\u2019t pressure her to try, because expectation tends to make her orgasm more elusive. Melissa actually orgasms more frequently now than she did when we were younger. We\u2019ve had 40 years to try out all the positions, and work out what suits us. Melissa has a great body, but I know she is insecure about it. She doesn\u2019t like her breasts, and I try to reassure her by being very vocal about how much I love them. She used to hide her nakedness from me: she would always turn around any time she took her bra off. But I\u2019ve noticed that since retirement she takes more pleasure in being naked. We both do. We spent the summer in the nude in the garden, which is something we never would have done in previous decades. As a rule, I want to have sex more frequently than Melissa. That doesn\u2019t upset me, because she tells me often how much she loves and desires me. Scheduling also ensures my higher libido isn\u2019t a point of conflict between us: sex happens at a pre-agreed time, so it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m repeatedly asking for it and being turned down. There have of course been times when we were in the garden together and I caught sight of her naked body, and longed for spontaneous sex. But ultimately, I think our system works well. Counting down the days makes sex feel more special.

He was laureate for Irish fiction from 2018 to 2021.

It has been described as \u201ca tour de force of transcendent power and complexity\u201d. Barry was born in Dublin and lives in a converted rectory in the mountains of County Wicklow, Ireland. Was it good to be back in Ireland with Old God\u2019s Time? Did it feel like coming home? I was in dread of coming home. I had spent two books [Days Without End and A Thousand Moons] in America, quite joyously\u2026 a kind of vast holiday. So, yes, it was coming home, but I was a bit\u2026 It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve been avoiding the whole strange cosmos of what we have done to children in this country, but I was certainly unable to write this book\u2026 until I did. When you get past 60, you do feel a sort of licence finally to write fearlessly about something that essentially is full of fear. The book contains some upsetting scenes. Do you have to be in a certain frame of mind to write those? You do. I had reached that frame of mind. It\u2019s not so much about the fact that there was child abuse in Ireland. It\u2019s, what do you do afterwards? How do you live? Because ultimate despair leads to a desire to leave the world. And I feared, as a person who has struggled with depression from time to time, I didn\u2019t want to do anything that was going to dismay me so much that I was going to be sweltering around in my depressive boots, trying to get through the mud. Despite the very different subject matters, this is your third novel in a row that becomes a bit of a page-turner. Where did that come from? It\u2019s a pardon for being a bit older. You think, OK, I\u2019m 68, I have hopefully 20 years. But which bit of that is going to be me just totally crocked, [and] how many years do you have [for] work? And to be alarmed that way is good for your work because you become less self-conscious. But the compulsive element of a book can\u2019t be put in\u2026 I love [that you call it a] page-turner, because that makes me feel it\u2019s its own self-generating artefact, that I\u2019ve managed to faithfully take it from the air through the medium of my stupefied brain. Do you prefer writing novels to plays these days? The last play was On Blueberry Hill, and it got to the West End, which I\u2019d never been to before. I was so excited! Suddenly, Graham Norton wants to talk to you. I found it pretty ravishing, to be honest. But then three days later, they closed the UK [for Covid lockdown] and that was that. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I\u2019ve found theatre very difficult, and I\u2019ve come a cropper a couple of times. [But] I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve completely given up on it. You\u2019re a great reader of your own work. Are you a frustrated performer? Well, that is my performance! I\u2019m not frustrated any more. I actually love reading to an audience. I will work really hard. I know my song well before I start singing, as Dylan said. I even sing any bits of songs that are connected to a book. And the bar is low, as you may have noticed, for writers performing. If you make the slightest effort, everyone thinks that\u2019s grand. In one of your lectures as laureate for Irish fiction, you talked about the thrill of getting a fan letter from Harold Pinter. Has anything matched that since? Yes. Out of the blue, in [2018] in the New York Review of Books there appeared this long article [about Barry\u2019s work] by Robert Gottlieb, who was the centre of American literature. I mean, he renamed Catch-18 to Catch-22. That is sublime editorial intervention. And we never met, but we emailed long emails. And when I finished Old God\u2019s Time I just thought, fuck it, and I sent [the novel] to him in an email. And he had this thing: always get back to a writer within three days, because the writer\u2019s going to be dying. So a few days later came this email of total magic about the book. And it just felt like travel insurance for the experience of [publishing] the book. What explains the renaissance and success in Irish writing recently? It\u2019s a golden age of writing and reading. There are devoted, vocational readers, and that\u2019s very inspirational. That\u2019s generated an atmosphere where writers feel they\u2019re going to be able to get their fish and chips out of this, because there is a receptive thing. You\u2019re sitting there partly going \u201cJeez, you\u2019re such a good writer, I hate you. Can I poison your soup quietly?\u201d That\u2019s part of it. But the other part is, \u201cAh! This is what it\u2019s for\u201d. Claire [Kilroy]\u2019s book [Soldier Sailor] just made me happy and grateful that I existed. Or Joseph O\u2019Connor\u2019s book about the actors [Shadowplay]. Then you have this occurrence of genius, [such as] Claire-Louise Bennett. Did you read growing up? I couldn\u2019t read until I was eight. My sister was reading from the age of four, which was incredibly irritating. My father had a travelling bookcase, and the spines of the Penguin books were on it, row after row after row. I didn\u2019t know what they were, but I knew they were something important. When I finally got a hook on it, I would go with my pocket money and buy a Puffin book every week or two. Where do you write? I work here, in the old study of the rector. I have a stove in the corner, I have my grandfather\u2019s notebooks and some of his paintings. I have my wife\u2019s theatre photograph when she was starting out, so beautiful I try not to look at it. I have a curtain which for some reason has pineapples on it. And I have the poster for Boss Grady\u2019s Boys, which was the first play that did that miraculous thing \u2013 it paid the rent.

Found in any yiayia\u2019s house, it\u2019s the kind kept in the special living room, reserved exclusively for guests. The chairs are part of Stubborn House, an art installation in Sydney which evokes a very specific look: the diaspora grandparent home. \u201cI think this aesthetic, whatever you want to call it, is completely underrepresented,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThis was our grandparents\u2019 and parents\u2019 attempts to build a place that reconciles the loss of the motherland with the adoption of the fatherland.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just fucking beautiful. I think the doilies are beautiful, the pillars, the red bricks, the pebbles, the concrete. They are all beautiful and deserve celebrating.\u201d Kelly, through his Sydney restaurant, Baba\u2019s Place, has sponsored the installation. Stubborn House\u2019s style is rooted in Australia\u2019s waves of postwar migration from southern and eastern Europe, as well as the Middle East, south-east Asia and north Africa. Intricate and maximalist, these homes are the bridges between the migrant and the diaspora. They are monuments to memories, with walls covered in black and white photos and cabinets filled with old, delicate glassware. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As much as they can, they resemble homes in Lebanon, Greece, Italy or Egypt. These efforts to create safe spaces in a new country have produced a distinctive aesthetic in Australia. Now, the look is threatened on several fronts: by suburban densification and gentrification resulting in some of these homes being demolished or renovated, and by fast furniture and modern design\u2019s insistent diktat that less is usually more. But the artist behind Stubborn House, Gabriella Lo Presti, says this diaspora aesthetic shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as kitsch, outdated or \u201clowbrow\u201d. She sourced wooden doors with frosted glass, Persian rugs, freestanding Tuscan columns and yards of synthetic lace curtains for the show, the last of which she draped over wrought iron fences. \u201cThere is something really beautiful about people being proud of their homes, of skilled migrants building beautiful houses in their image,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are sanctuaries away from the everyday of Australian life and aesthetics, where these families could be themselves.\u201d Lo Presti says migrant stories and design choices reflect the cultural history of Sydney. \u201cI think it\u2019s about time this look is being valued, and that there are conversations on how to preserve it.\u201d Down in Melbourne, similar efforts are under way to preserve and honour migrant home builders\u2019 contributions. Mete Erdo\u011fan and his partner, Georgia Frances King, are restoring a 70s-style federation house (lovingly nicknamed \u201cShag Manor\u201d) in Melbourne\u2019s north and documenting the process on Instagram. They are making meticulous efforts to ensure the restoration honours the legacy of migrants - preserving a home that was partly inspired by a homeland, and partly very Australian. They call the look \u201cFedeterranean\u201d, a mix of federation and Mediterranean, with Erdo\u011fan saying he is keen to maintain \u201cremnants\u201d of his culture and upbringing. \u201cMy parents are Turkish-Cypriot immigrants, and I grew up visiting aunts, uncles and grandparent homes that look a lot like this.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what gives it that really specific look, that combination of elements. We want to pay respect to the materials and attention to detail that people put into building their homes.\u201d Erdo\u011fan admires his forebears\u2019 sense of quality. \u201cOur grandparents ultimately felt these were beautiful spaces; they brought over so much of themselves, and it\u2019s important we recognise these things.\u201d This process of restoration and production is described by Prof Mirjana Lozanovska, from Deakin University, as an \u201cimmense and profound\u201d act of agency. \u201cThese kinds of interpretations \u2026 really shift the narrative,\u201d she says. Lozanovska says the process of defining a style both produced a new Australian identity, while honouring the efforts and journeys of the migrants that created it. \u201c[These migrants] came and lived together, where rent was cheap, and built a new kind of street aesthetic, with larger windows and grape vines or lemon trees.\u201d Younger generations, however, adopt these design choices out of a sense of nostalgia for their grandparents, rather than memorialising the homeland. Lozanovska says Baba\u2019s Place, Stubborn House and Shag Manor all share and celebrate this specifically Australian aesthetic. \u201cThey are not looking beyond Australia to a homeland, which is very significant. They are writing their own histories, their own backgrounds.\u201d Back in Sydney\u2019s Marrickville, at Baba\u2019s Place there are vitrines filled with trinkets and rugs hung on walls, alongside photographs and maps of eastern European and Middle Eastern countries. \u201cThey are new and inventive,\u201d Kelly says of the homes that inspired his restaurant\u2019s decor. \u201cAnd to us diaspora kids, this look represents something stable and comfortable. These were the homes we grew up in.\u201d The restaurant\u2019s food and setting is cross-diasporic. It is not focused on singular thinking about culinary or cultural heritage, bound to a particular \u201chomeland\u201d. This isn\u2019t a Middle Eastern restaurant or a Balkan restaurant. Nor were the installations in Stubborn House rooted in one community or ethnic identity. Instead, Kelly and his contemporaries recognise that the act of migration forges creation: \u201cWe are trying to show those spaces respect, as well as showing who we are.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-10", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Mostafa Rachwani", "id": 392, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e8ea1765d645352a5030460a0b6c6c3b12711e95/0_295_8192_4915/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Streaming: the best films about artists", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/10/streaming-the-best-films-about-artists", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.075, "neu": 0.724, "pos": 0.201, "compound": 0.9975}, "body": "Visual art, oddly, doesn\u2019t always translate that naturally to cinema as a subject. Just as you don\u2019t get the full impact of a painting from a coffee table book, the camera can impose a distance from the art at hand \u2013 a secondary perspective that isn\u2019t really needed. Wim Wenders bucks that trend, however, in his marvellous Anselm Kiefer documentary Anselm (Curzon Home Cinema), which feels fully alive to the angular, nature-based textures of the German painter and sculptor\u2019s work. It\u2019s especially exciting as a study of process \u2013 of the grand-scale action that goes into the art\u2019s own dynamic movement. A large part of its reward came, on the big screen, from Wenders\u2019 continuingly imaginative embrace of 3D technology. Now on VOD, the film loses that element but remains engaging for the connection it draws between Kiefer\u2019s own thorny persona and the work itself, and its elegant bridging of the artist with his dramatised younger selves. As a documentary about an artist that makes clear how their vision emerges from their character, Anselm is not as scrappily candid as Jack Hazan\u2019s 1973 landmark A Bigger Splash (Netflix), but belongs in that league just the same. Hazan\u2019s film intimately traces the breakdown of David Hockney\u2019s relationship with former lover Peter Schlesinger over a three-year period, and its effect on Hockney\u2019s work and perspective. It alternates fly-on-the-wall observation with flights of overtly queer fantasy, serving its subject with a fascination that never feels fawning. Corinna Belz\u2019s plainly titled Gerhard Richter Painting (2011) is a more straightforward documentary that nonetheless feels just as illuminating on its subject\u2019s work and sensibility \u2013 largely because it has the patience to stand by and watch as Richter prepares and layers his canvases (the procedural nature of the film proves rather riveting). It\u2019s a relatively rare portrait, alongside those by Wenders and Hazan, of an artist who is famous in their own time. Halina Ryschka\u2019s 2019 doc Beyond the Visible: Hilma af Klint is instead a dedicated effort to elevate the status of a female artist \u2013 the now celebrated Swedish abstract mystic \u2013 who never got her due by the time of her death in 1944. The documentary lacks Af Klint\u2019s own radicalism, but it persuasively makes its case. Other great artists of yore have to make do with the classic biopic treatment, with the same names surfacing repeatedly. Film-makers simply cannot leave Vincent van Gogh alone, for example. Kirk Douglas gave him a tortured brawniness in Vincente Minnelli\u2019s romanticised but unabashedly gorgeous Lust for Life (1956); Willem Dafoe probably came closer to the mark in the recent At Eternity\u2019s Gate, though fellow artist Julian Schnabel\u2019s film was fussily overworked; and the elaborately animated exercise Loving Vincent (2017) simply lets the pictures do the literal talking. (Robert Altman\u2019s 1990 Vincent &amp; Theo, probably the best of them, alas can\u2019t be streamed anywhere in the UK.) Schnabel\u2019s artist\u2019s eye served his subject to more kinetic effect in his 1996 debut, Basquiat (Apple TV), assisted by Jeffrey Wright\u2019s raw, restless performance as the doomed young postmodernist. I\u2019ve always liked the stripped-down emotional volatility of Ed Harris\u2019s Pollock, which captures Jackson Pollock\u2019s stoic masculinity and his mania, and deservedly won an Oscar for Marcia Gay Harden\u2019s seething Lee Krasner. There may be a National Trust beauty to Mike Leigh\u2019s Mr Turner, but it digs intelligently beneath the English complacency that JMW Turner\u2019s canvases raged against. Julie Taymor\u2019s Frida reflected the reckless visual iridescence of Frida Kahlo\u2019s painting, though dramatically it was stodgier stuff \u2013 in sore need of the unbound sensual experimentalism that Derek Jarman so aptly brought to his gilded erotic ode to Caravaggio. Artist biopics are often best off, however, when they take on less obvious subjects. At the intimate end of that scale, I have great affection for Maudie, Aisling Walsh\u2019s tender, tactile study of arthritis-stricken folk artist Maud Lewis, beautifully played by Sally Hawkins. But the daddy of them all is Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s immense Andrei Rublev, a portrait of a 15th-century Russian icon painter that distils a whole national relationship to art, poetry and faith in its one brooding life story. All titles available to rent on multiple platforms unless specified. Also new on streaming Earth Mama (We Are Parable) Savanah Leaf\u2019s gutsy, Bafta-nominated debut feature rests on a stunning performance by Tia Nomore as a pregnant woman in recovery from drug addiction, trying to reassemble her life and her family in the San Francisco Bay Area. It may sound like standard-issue miserablism, but there\u2019s unusual beauty and humour in its worldview. Manodrome South African director John Trengove got much attention for his visceral queer coming-of-ager The Wound. Far starrier but shuffled straight to VOD, his new film also dwells thoughtfully on matters of toxic masculinity, following a young father-to-be (a fine Jesse Eisenberg) submerged into a male libertarian cult. Its observations on incel culture are blunt, but the film does have shivery impact. Night Swim A nice suburban family finds that their swimming pool is haunted \u2013 sure, why not?

Not that Madrid is a fan of the Chiefs, or the San Francisco 49ers, who they face on Sunday. The 32-year-old didn\u2019t check out the official NFL gear for her upcoming Super Bowl shindig. Instead, she went on the hunt for clothes inspired by her favourite artist: Taylor Swift. Ever since Swift began dating the Chiefs\u2019 star tight end Travis Kelce, Swifties have been showing up for the team. Madrid visited TikTok and Etsy and, after swiping past \u201cSwiftie Super Bowl\u201d and \u201cIn My Super Bowl Era\u201d merchandise, she opted for a $46 (\u00a336) red sweatshirt with \u201cSwiftie\u201d stretched across the front and Kelce\u2019s name and jersey number, 87, on the back. \u201cI wanted something a little bit more long-lasting, just in case they don\u2019t win,\u201d Madrid confesses. The sweatshirt is one of thousands of Swift-inspired Super Bowl items available ahead of this Sunday\u2019s big game. With Swifties like Madrid supporting their idol and the Chiefs, many independent merchants have capitalised on the fandom\u2019s interest in the game. One such entrepreneur is Hayley Williams, an Atlanta-based lawyer, who began selling clothing on Etsy as a side hustle. After a colleague suggested hawking merchandise for football-crazed Swifites, Williams initially resisted. \u201cAt first I thought: that sounds too niche to possibly be successful \u2026 I was very wrong.\u201d Since the Chiefs reached the Super Bowl two weekends ago, she says she has sold eighteen \u201cGo Taylor\u2019s Boyfriend\u201d sweatshirts at $35 each. While the world has seen plenty of celebrity-athlete couples, Swift is in an entirely different stratosphere of fame (her music is streamed in America more than the entire genres of jazz and classical). Many Swifties obsess over her life\u2019s smallest details \u2013 such as whether she fixed a chipped tooth \u2013 and her relationship with Kelce is catnip for devotees. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a parasocial aspect to their relationship because they are heavily invested in Taylor\u2019s romantic life,\u201d Lorynn Divita, an associate professor of apparel design and merchandising at Baylor University, says of the megastar\u2019s fans. \u201cThere\u2019s no element too small for them to chronicle.\u201d Over the years, Taylormania has allowed merchants to peddle apparel nodding to the superstar\u2019s life and music. When the 14-time Grammy winner split from actor Joe Alwyn, shirts went on sale that read \u201cWho\u2019s Joe Alwyn Anyway? Ew.,\u201d a reference to a lyric from her song 22. During the first leg of Swift\u2019s ongoing Eras Tour, many concertgoers wore outfits inspired by the singer, including New York University graduation gowns in honour of the commencement address she gave at the school in 2022. As Kelce replaces Alwyn and Swifties look for new ways to show their allegiance, Etsy and TikTok Shop sellers can react rapidly to to such a cultural moment, in ways traditional manufacturers can\u2019t. \u201cThere is no way that they could have anticipated and created merchandise to accommodate this new fan,\u201d Divita says. But some aren\u2019t as enchanted by the singer\u2019s new lover. A few prominent far-right conservatives have lashed out at Traylor, touting conspiracy theories about the authenticity of the relationship. Others have criticised television networks\u2019 NFL coverage, claiming they\u2019re showing more Swift than football (Swift appeared on television for less than a minute of the AFC championship game). Bradley Thomas, a content creator for NBC Sports, says Swift\u2019s association with the NFL is beneficial for the league because she has introduced the sport to new fans. \u201cWhile my wife is married to an absolute sports maniac, she didn\u2019t have the kind of connection with the NFL that I do,\u201d he says. \u201cNow she\u2019s bringing up things about the Kansas City Chiefs that I didn\u2019t even know.\u201d At his wife\u2019s suggestion, Thomas, who also operates an Etsy store, designed his own spin on the Eras Tour official merchandise, selling a T-shirt that reads, \u201cThe Football Era\u201d with a picture of Kelce in a bow and arrow pose and a collage of Swift at different Chiefs games. He also offers shirts that say \u201cKansas City Swiftie.\u201d The Super Bowl has always been a popular merchandising event, with the NFL moving hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods tied to the game. Thomas\u2019s merchandise, like other unofficial gear, exists in a legal gray zone: copyright holders could ask Etsy to take down listings if they infringe upon intellectual property or trademarks. So far, the NFL and Swift have tolerated it. The popularity of Super Bowl clothing tied to Taylor underscores the buying power of long-neglected female sports fans, according to Divita. \u201cSmart teams will hopefully now learn not to overlook that female demographic, because this shows they were just waiting for someone to open the gates for them,\u201d she says. Next season, the league could introduce more Kelce garb to meet fan demand. But if the couple breaks up, independent merchants could rework their Alwyn designs to read \u201cWho\u2019s Travis Kelce Anyway?

Mojo (1996): zoot suits and snarls; the urban snap of Pinter. Jerusalem (2009): dark and glorious, a lament for, and celebration of, a fraying countryside. The Ferryman (2017): a tribute to the great lift of Irish dramatic writing. Now The Hills of California: part of the slow female-isation of the stage. Last week, Beth Steel\u2019s rousing Till the Stars Come Down showed \u2013 with a great lash of language and velocity of action \u2013 sisters coming together for a disruptive family wedding in their Nottinghamshire home. In Butterworth\u2019s new play, women gather around their dying mother in the Blackpool boarding house where they spent their 1950s childhoods some 20 years earlier. The resort\u2019s pizazz has faded but illusions linger. Butterworth is ingenious about the way fantasy traps and inspires. The house is called Sea View \u2013 which is not true. The rooms are given the names of American states: \u201cI\u2019m going to Minnesota\u201d may mean going to the room next to the lav. Rob Howell\u2019s crammed design \u2013 dark brown bannisters, many lamps and a bar with a tufty straw roof \u2013 captures a sense of stranded hope, but less realism might have suggested more of the wan beauty of the play\u2019s central conceit. This dying mother dreamed of making her daughters into a mini-version of wartime boogie-woogie trio the Andrews Sisters. The girls\u2019 routine, awkward and impressive, is seen and heard in flashback: Sophia Ally, Nancy Allsop, Lara McDonnell and Nicola Turner sing and elbow wonderfully in their apricot uniforms, with alarming shiny stockings, air-hostess hats and tasselled skirts. The dream of stage success is an illusion, which leads to the drama\u2019s main secret and shock, yet the harmonies are real and implant enduring memories: songs are beautifully envisaged as places in which to dwell and hide. Sam Mendes\u2019s production is motored by fine acting from Leanne Best (ravaging hectically), Ophelia Lovibond and Helena Wilson, and by a gleaming central performance from Laura Donnelly, who manages to be apparently all-too-obvious and yet ultimately mysterious: details of what she actually does would spoil the pivot of the plot. The evening unfolds gradually \u2013 the opening scene could do with some of the musical zip that comes later; its pleasures come not from surprises of form or linguistic intensity, but from unexpected observations, social excavation. I love the idea planted here that there is a male category that is the opposite of trophy wives: lumpy or mildly vacant men who potter around doing hobbies and funny voices and have been selected by their women because they elevate them. I love the promotion of the Andrews Sisters, with their disconcerting mixture of attack and seduction: the dulcet quality of their harmonising undercut by the jagged swing of their jaws and hips. It would be hard to claim a place now for some of their calypso renderings \u2013 but bring on more listens to Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy. Lemn Sissay, poetic champion of the outcast, has written a new adaptation of Franz Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis: man turns into a beetle and finds everyone has turned against him. It is directed by Scott Graham, of the physical theatre company Frantic Assembly, who speed their productions with gesture and movement, abolishing the distinction between walking and dancing, between flesh and furniture: they pass bodies to each other in the air like parcels. The combination of talents should be perfect for Kafka\u2019s 1915 novella, but the result is disappointingly stuck and hectoring. How can a play about change move so little? Metamorphosis poses obvious physical challenges for the theatre, but it is rich in interpretative possibilities. Eighteen years ago at the same theatre, with music by Nick Cave and an elastic performance by G\u00edsli \u00d6rn Gar\u00f0arsson \u2013 a member of the Icelandic national gymnastic team \u2013 it effortlessly became a portrait of fascism. Sissay brings his own particular focus: there are thunderous passages about unremitting labour, poverty and whip-cracking officials, but a new fierce emphasis on the experience of being outcast by family. The main character is turned into an adopted child, less cherished than his sister, with whom he has an incestuous brush. Sissay fills the mouth of his hero with ferociously gibbering descriptions of gargoyles, skeleton-headed storks and his mother becoming a lampshade. Simisola Majekodunmi\u2019s lighting throws giant fractured shadows over the faded room on the verge of squalor designed by Jon Bausor. Though Felipe Pacheco never attains full beetledom, he has a bristling moment with chair legs, and increasingly treats the stage like a series of perches, brilliantly balancing on the iron bedhead, hanging upside down from the ceiling, dangling from the light cord. These strong elements don\u2019t fuse or urge each other on. Pacheco\u2019s extraordinary movements take place in the background while speeches are delivered at full roar, like diatribes. The result is not an embodiment of horror but a self-conscious metaphor. The most revelatory moment in Candace Bushnell\u2019s one-woman show comes when she asks her huge audience of Sex and the City fans to guess which parts of the series were based on her own life. Yes: she did go out with a senator. But, no: he didn\u2019t ask her to pee on him. It\u2019s a rare nugget. On stage with a bright pink sofa, and (knowing winks) a shoe closet, Bushnell delivers two hours of screechingly bland self-promotion in a voice as thin as her Manolo Blahnik stilettos, her face rigid with surprise at her surpriseless script. It seems impossible that the evening will pass without one squeak of irony being heard, but so it proves. The bulk of the weightless occasion is made up of a list of the times Bushnell got on to the New York Times bestseller list, self-help injunctions and the weird view that women will be freed by being told to behave like old-fashioned blokes. Bushnell tells us she has \u201chelped change the way the world looks at women\u201d. Not necessarily for the better. Give me the Andrews Sisters any day.

Doyle, who plays keyboard for the band, had kept it so well hidden that when a bandmate watched the documentary, her arthritis was news to him.

Then I lived with that discomfort for 30 years.\u201d When she was 17, she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that affects the joints. She was told that the condition would progress and that she might need to use a wheelchair by the time she was 30, an idea the teenager did not take well. \u201cIt was a dark time,\u201d she says. Music helped \u2013 she was into punk, and got into the Undertones and started following them around, going to their gigs. Doyle dropped out of sixth form. \u201cI think because I was living every day and night with discomfort, and I wasn\u2019t that interested,\u201d she says. \u201cI just wanted to date boys, go dancing and see groups.\u201d Almost everyone she knew was in bands \u2013 her brother Magnus was in an earlier Pulp lineup as the drummer and, when their keyboardist left, he suggested Doyle, who had been having piano lessons since she was seven. It was another 10 years before Pulp became huge. \u201cAs we began to rise, it was really, really exciting,\u201d says Doyle. They were on Top of the Pops \u2013 \u201cThe first time was amazing. I was quite drunk, but we were miming,\u201d \u2013 and headlined Glastonbury in 1995. \u201cThat was mind-blowing, almost traumatic,\u201d says Doyle. She was quite introverted and happy to be in the background. Jarvis Cocker, the magnetic frontman, got almost all the attention. \u201cThank God,\u201d says Doyle. Cocker knew about her arthritis, but she didn\u2019t talk about it with the rest of the band \u2013 \u201cI never wanted it to make me different,\u201d she says \u2013 and it didn\u2019t affect her life too much. But when she started to lose movement in her arm, she had to keep raising the keyboard \u201cbecause my arm couldn\u2019t reach down as much\u201d. At the height of Pulp\u2019s fame, life was relentless. \u201cWe worked a lot, we toured a lot. We didn\u2019t have many days off. It came to a point where I just got overstressed and had a huge panic attack on tour. It just got too much.\u201d In 2002, the band took a break. Doyle, then in her late 30s, went travelling for a year. Sometimes her knees would swell and she would have to stay indoors for several days, wondering if she should come home. \u201cI thought no, I\u2019m going to keep going.\u201d A friend had given her a self-help book \u2013 this was long before they were considered acceptable. Doyle felt embarrassed about needing help. She finally read it when she got to New Zealand, when \u201cyou couldn\u2019t get any further away [from the UK],\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cI was approaching 40 and I knew that [the arthritis] would get worse if I didn\u2019t pay it attention. It was becoming visible as well. Going to a shop and getting the change, having to turn my hand, that was getting difficult. I\u2019d noticed some things were getting harder.\u201d Now, she says, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to have straight arms and fingers that can do everything other people\u2019s hands and fingers and wrists do\u201d. Back in the UK, she was inspired by friends who had become counsellors \u2013 and, as part of it, had therapy themselves \u2013 and Doyle trained to become one, doing that for the next 13 years. \u201cI realised thoughts can affect how you see the world or how you see yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cI discovered denial and I thought, \u2018oh right, yeah\u2019.\u201d When Doyle hit the menopause, the discomfort associated with her arthritis virtually disappeared. \u201cI don\u2019t have that constant ache, which is such an incredible relief,\u201d she says. She still does exercises and takes meloxicam, an anti-inflammatory drug. Playing keyboards helps. \u201cI think if I didn\u2019t, my fingers would probably be worse,\u201d she says. Pulp had some gigs last year, and there are more to come. It\u2019s \u201camazing\u201d she says, to be playing together again. Now if Doyle has to play a lot of fast chords, she samples them so can play them using one note, rather than three. It has only been in the last decade that Doyle, now 60, has been able to talk to friends about her condition. Over the years, she has had to work, she says, on how she felt about her body. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shame. When I go to put a coat on, I can\u2019t just throw it over, it can take a bit of time and I still find that embarrassing. I still don\u2019t like to do that in front of people.\u201d She remembers doing a course on body image about 15 years ago, where she had to draw herself. She drew her arms \u201clike two bits of wood. I felt my arms were like sticks, they didn\u2019t even feel like part of my body. I look back now and think that\u2019s such an awful way to look at yourself.\u201d Getting to a point of acceptance, and even love, of her body has helped a lot, she says. \u201cThe more that I can accept how my body is, the more enjoyable my life\u2019s going to be.\u201d \u2022 For more information visit Arthritis Action", "date": "2024-02-11", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Emine Saner", "id": 397, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0376c851cdff0dd8349e4603f4a096dfe284d95d/0_274_8192_4915/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018It\u2019s almost like karaoke\u2019: classic UK TV sitcoms transfer to stage \u2013 and thrill the superfans", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/11/classic-tv-sitcoms-stage-fawlty-towers-fast-show-only-fools-and-horses", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.081, "neu": 0.694, "pos": 0.226, "compound": 0.9992}, "body": "If you were craving a hit of comedy nostalgia, where would you go? Perhaps you\u2019d start with a streaming platform or \u2013 if you find it especially hard to let go of the past \u2013 your DVD collection. But nowadays somewhere else is ready to slake that thirst for comfortingly, familiarly funny TV: your local theatre. Later this month, era-defining sketch series The Fast Show will begin its nationwide stage tour, reuniting the original cast (Paul Whitehouse, Charlie Higson, John Thomson, Arabella Weir) to perform favourite sketches and discuss their memories of working on the show. It joins Drop the Dead Donkey: The Reawakening!, an updated version of the satirical newsroom-set sitcom that ran during the 1990s, which has already set off on its UK tour with most of the original cast. They\u2019ll soon be joined by John Cleese\u2019s stage production of Fawlty Towers, which is getting a five-month stint at the Apollo theatre from May (other 1970s sitcoms recently adapted for the stage include The Good Life and Some Mothers Do \u2019Ave \u2019Em). This autumn, meanwhile, the musical version of Only Fools and Horses, written by Paul Whitehouse and late creator John Sullivan\u2019s son Jim, is set to follow its West End run with a 30-city tour of the UK. In fact, the West End is becoming a home from home for retro British comedy, with Idiots Assemble: Spitting Image The Musical having had a four-month run last year. The transfer of comedy from stage to screen then back again is nothing new (\u2019Allo \u2019Allo! toured from 1986 to 1992, Bottom staged live shows throughout the 90s), yet the sheer volume of high-profile TV-to-stage adaptations doing surprisingly good business in top theatres makes this very much a modern phenomenon. Only Fools and Horses: The Musical might have received middling reviews, but it was a considerable financial success, earning \u00a38m during the first four weeks of its London run. Demand for tickets to An Evening With The Fast Show and Drop the Dead Donkey: The Reawakening! was such that extra dates have already been added. What is behind the boom in shows based on vintage TV comedy? In one sense, it\u2019s merely part of a much bigger \u2013 overwhelmingly huge, in fact \u2013 trend in contemporary popular culture: intellectual property, or IP. This is the tendency for new theatre productions (or TV programmes or films) to take inspiration from a well-known story, character or fictional world. That familiarity makes shows a safer bet, with theatres finding \u201csecurity in the knowledge these will prove popular\u201d, says Caroline Usher-Fox, marketing and communications manager of the Grand Opera House York, which is preparing to stage The Fast Show and Only Fools and Horses this year. The instant recognition factor is extremely helpful for an industry that is notoriously cash-strapped. As Steve Bennett \u2013 who runs comedy website Chortle and has reviewed many sitcom-to-stage adaptations \u2013 explains, theatres are \u201calways looking for existing IPs so people can go: \u2018I know what that is\u2019, and it shortcuts the marketing.\u201d Yet these productions chime with a more specific subset of the IP craze. At the moment, Usher-Fox is seeing \u201c80s and 90s classics sell incredibly well\u201d, with musical versions of Pretty Woman, Sister Act and An Officer and a Gentleman arriving at the opera house this year (musical takes on IP are particularly popular, a fact the Only Fools and Horses and Spitting Image shows took advantage of). That period of pop culture is proving particularly attractive, with comedy from the 70s, 80s and 90s being \u201can especially valuable bit of intellectual property because it appeals to a slightly older audience who\u2019ve got some money to go to the theatre\u201d, says Bennett. As Usher-Fox says, \u201ca thirst for nostalgia and familiarity\u201d is clearly behind the appeal of these shows. With sitcom, that familiarity can run very deep. Cleese\u2019s Fawlty Towers \u2013 The Play stitches together the plots of three episodes (it is seemingly based on a show staged in Australia in 2016), offering a chance for diehards to relive plot lines and dialogue they know off by heart (\u201cIt\u2019s almost like karaoke,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cYou sing along with them\u201d). While the Fawlty Towers stage show will see a cast of young actors taking on classic characters, Dead Donkey and The Fast Show feature the original players, providing an extra layer of familiarity and yet more \u201creassurance they are in for a good night\u201d, says Usher-Fox. It\u2019s worth pointing out that this cosy legacy is not necessarily at odds with the original tenor of these shows: comedy\u2019s ability to provide comfort and reassurance doesn\u2019t only come via a trip down memory lane. David Stubbs, author of Different Times: A History of British Comedy, explains that the element of familiarity is hardwired into many of these comedy programmes. \u201cIt\u2019s often said that comedy is about surprise, but it is also about the predictable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Fast Show, with its catchphrases, was a brilliant exercise in comedy as predictability.\u201d But why not engage in an even more predictable activity by simply watching old programmes at home? One answer is these shows do something the source material can\u2019t: provide an opportunity for connection with beloved performers and creators, and offer an experience of communal fandom and togetherness. \u201cAudiences know they\u2019ll be laughing in unison with a room full of other fans,\u201d says Usher-Fox. something device-based streaming sorely lacks. That highlights another dimension of nostalgia these shows tap into: a longing for the monoculture of yore. Older audiences miss \u201cbig, unifying pop-cultural television events from the days before multiple channels, streaming and the diffuseness of content\u201d, says Stubbs. Nowadays \u201cno comedy show is going to garner the sort of 20 million-plus audiences a Steptoe or Morecambe &amp; Wise did.\u201d Contemporary comedy \u2013 with its emphasis on \u201cinclusivity, nuance, a sense of compassion, depth of character and a certain kindness\u201d \u2013 is quite different from its forebears, especially in tone. Such programmes aren\u2019t always \u201cuproarious, are more esoteric and liable to alienate older viewers who grumble about comedy not being what it used to be, if indeed they come across these shows at all\u201d, says Stubbs. If the appeal for audiences is clear, the attraction for creatives is less immediately obvious. However, it has some connection to the parlous state of TV comedy \u2013 as Bennett puts it, there\u2019s simply \u201cnot much sitcom being made any more\u201d. In fact, in November Ofcom ruled scripted comedy an \u201cat risk\u201d genre for the sixth year running. Sitcom-to-stage shows could be \u201ca way of getting to write something that they can get commissioned and get a go-ahead quite quickly\u201d, says Bennett. \u201cWhereas TV takes forever and there\u2019s not much of it.\u201d Even writers who have earned their stripes with several hits seem to be struggling: Kate &amp; Koji, the last sitcom from Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin \u2013 the writers behind Drop the Dead Donkey and Outnumbered \u2013 got poor reviews, and was dropped after two series. And although John Cleese announced last year that he was working on a new television version of Fawlty Towers with his daughter, no broadcaster is attached (the BBC\u2019s head of comedy expressed doubt about the project\u2019s comic potential when asked), and it is unclear whether the reboot will ever go into production. In artistic terms, then, are these stage productions the poor relatives of TV comedy? Despite their box-office successes, they have tended to attract lukewarm reviews, with critics praising the performances and staging but expressing disappointment in the scripts. Some struggle to outshine the originals, yet Bennett thinks the problem is often related to overly high expectations in the opposite sense. Last year he reviewed Idiots Assemble: Spitting Image the Musical, writing: \u201cYou might expect drum-tight material, but much of Idiots Assemble has a first-draft \u2018will this do?\u2019 quality.\u201d Yet that is probably truer to the original programme than we might like to think. \u201cPeople remember Spitting Image as being brilliant when it probably was pretty patchy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou remember all the best bits.\u201d When it comes to the late 20th-century comedy canon, this shift to the stage seems too lucrative to die any time soon. Could it also be coming for gen X and millennial favourites? The naturalistic, mockumentary style of many of the best 00s comedies (The Office, The Thick of It) would certainly make it harder to translate them into big, ebullient stage shows. Yet comedy characters of the era are increasingly returning to theatres \u2013 Alan Partridge did an arena tour in 2022 and Garth Marenghi is now on the road, while Ali G is reportedly destined to join them \u2013 showing there is potential to mine crowd-pleasing live shows from postmodern comedy. It remains to be seen whether their cast and writers will embrace the trend, but it\u2019s perhaps too early to take Peep Show: The Musical! off the table just yet.", "date": "2024-02-11", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Rachel Aroesti", "id": 398, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/45e6d728003c9c477274cedf5be712629da16b48/0_165_2655_1593/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Helado Negro: Phasor review \u2013 undimmable warmth ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/11/helado-negro-phasor-review-undimmable-warmth-4ad", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.053, "neu": 0.639, "pos": 0.308, "compound": 0.9868}, "body": "American sound artist Helado Negro (born Roberto Carlos Lange) is a songwriter, beatmaker and producer whose work quivers with the giddy joy of invention.

Jenny McAllister, the assistant minister for climate change and energy, said \u201cthe community sector worked hard over the last decade of climate denial and delay to bring attention to the importance of energy efficiency\u201d. \u201cSmall changes can make an enormous difference in the comfort and cost of cooling or heating a home,\u201d McAllister said. \u201cA total of $600m of commonwealth and state funding will make an enormous difference to the wellbeing and energy bills of at least 60,000 families living in social housing across the country.\u201d Alan Pears, a senior RMIT industry fellow, said the Acoss report was comprehensive and reasonable. \u201cThe challenge is to mobilise governments to act,\u201d Pears said. \u201cMy review of EU progress in housing retrofits showed they have also struggled to drive \u2018deep\u2019 upgrades, which are really what\u2019s needed to deliver health benefits.\u201d Apartment refits, though, created additional barriers, given the mix of owners and renters.

I used to live with my family, but for the past two years, I\u2019ve been living alone in a studio near my university. What do you do? I major in industrial and information systems engineering. I did my compulsory 18-months military service around my studies, and I have one year to go. I\u2019m learning about production scheduling, quality management and the growing importance of AI and big data, especially related to South Korea. What apps do you use? \u201cKakaoTalk\u201d is a Korean messaging app that every single person uses. No jokes. And a food delivery app\u2026 which might be making me lazy. I\u2019m always on YouTube and might have a slight addiction to Instagram All these short videos \u2026 it\u2019s hard to take a break. What do you listen to? I\u2019m all about K-pop! I lean more towards tunes that aren\u2019t overly upbeat but still carry a certain charm. Lately, I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of tracks by a singer named Yerin Baek. Also highly recommend Square that\u2019s sung in English. What do you eat? I absolutely love traditional Korean food. I\u2019m almost obsessed with kimchi stew, but no one makes it better than my mum. Living alone now, I try to make the dish at home, but a few months ago, a local man started selling it to broke students for just 3,000 won (\u00a31.80; $2.25) right in front of my house! So my home cooking has \u2026 taken a bit of a backseat shall we say? If you come to Korea, come to Jeonju, you\u2019re in for a culinary treat. How do you socialise? My friends and I usually hang out at restaurants or bars. We also have an unspoken rule we bring to every gathering \u2013 \u201cmeme studies\u201d. Memes are an integral part of our identity; we just can\u2019t define ourselves without them, and by \u201cstudies\u201d I mean laughing and having a good time lol. But we also do some serious talking. Since we all want jobs in the corporate world, job-related discussions have dominated recent conversations. It\u2019s something I\u2019m really worried about. What do you wear? Koreans really love their padded jackets, especially those in their 20s and 30s. I have a couple. Winters can be really dry, and in some places, temperatures can easily drop below -10\u00b0C. With the biting cold wind, it feels like your skin could tear apart. My wardrobe is mostly dark-coloured. I also prefer comfortable or oversized clothes. Guys my age hate skinny jeans, and you\u2019ll definitely never catch me wearing them! Tell us about your Saturday If I\u2019m not meeting friends and it\u2019s not cold, I usually start with a light 3-5 km run. I\u2019m not the type to stay at home all day, so after eating, I like to grab the camera my dad gave me when I was younger and go out exploring. I love capturing spaces I find appealing. Then, I like to sit in a quiet spot and listen to music. My friends are going to tease me by asking, \u201cWhen the hell were you ever like that?\u201d but I\u2019m serious. When I\u2019m alone, I tend to do these things occasionally ... haha! How do you relax? Either lying in bed watching Netflix or going out for walks and taking photos. Meeting friends and indulging in yummy foods. But what I really love is travelling, that\u2019s my ultimate way to unwind. I have a special affection for Jeju Island, a short flight away. It\u2019s really beautiful, and I find solace in just staring at the sea there. I\u2019d love to live there someday. What do you want? I want a career. As graduation approaches, I know I need to secure a job.I\u2019d love to pursue a career in production management. But more immediately, what I want most are diverse experiences. Experience shapes us, right? I crave a variety of experiences because they enrich and diversify who I am. What do you fear? Me five years from now. I wonder how I\u2019ll perceive myself then. Even though I\u2019m determined to gain experiences now, I worry if I\u2019ll look back and say, \u201cYes, that was the right path; I did well.\u201d However, since I can\u2019t predict what will happen tomorrow, let alone in five years, I know I need to walk the path I\u2019ve chosen with confidence and give it my best shot. What do you want to tell us? There\u2019s a famous story in Korea about a Buddhist monk called Wonhyo who took shelter in a cave during a rainstorm on his way to China to seek enlightenment. During the night, he was thirsty and drank what he thought was fresh water from a bowl. The next day he realised it was actually putrid water from a human skull, and that the cave was actually a tomb. This torment led him to realise \u201cAll is what comes from the mind.\u201d I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019ve been needlessly anxious about my plans for this year, forgetting this simple truth. What\u2019s next? I\u2019ll continue learning. But I plan to take a break from my studies, and I want to try out a working holiday in Australia. Apart from China and Japan, I haven\u2019t been abroad. What does the world in 2024 look like to you? I hope that in 2024 we can reduce our suffering. I believe that through dialogue with mutual respect, interest in one another, and an open mind, we can alleviate pain arising from various conflicts such as those based on religion, generation, gender, ideology and so on.

Unfortunately, the fashion industry has a terrible habit of making clothes for a limited part of the population. Even though the average Australian woman is a size 14 to 16, many designers do not make clothes in those sizes or larger \u2013 and when they do, they order them sparingly. Sizing is even more limited in the sustainable fashion space, which means looking good and feeling comfortable about your impact on the planet isn\u2019t always possible for everybody. But there are designers and businesses working to change this. Here, fashion industry professionals share their favourite inclusive, sustainable brands. Fit-focused makers Amy Ludvik established her pattern design business, Amy of Melbourne, because she was frustrated by the lack of stylish, size-inclusive, accessible fashion. As a skilled sewer, she makes a lot of clothes for herself: everything from T-shirts to formalwear. When she shops off the rack she seeks out designers who go beyond an expanded size range and really think about the fit of the clothes. Ludvik looks for \u201cfashion that can move and support the body across life and all of the wearer\u2019s adventures\u201d. Her favourite inclusive and sustainable designers are August and Eve, Miskonduct, Chasing Springtime, Embracing Bella, Made590 and Donna Donna. \u201cI also really love the dedication shown by August and Eve to upcycle textiles and reduce textile waste, through their beautiful bespoke garments.\u201d For jeans and trousers, she turns to S\u00dcK Workwear and Cotton On. For size-inclusive underwear and bras, she recommends Curvy for their customer service \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s incredible\u201d \u2013 and Playful Promises because they have a really fantastic range of sizes and styles available for all. Clean, simple and sophisticated Chelsea Bonner, the chief executive of Bella Management, loves comfort and versatility in her wardrobe. She loves anything she can wear both heels and trainers with so it\u2019s easy to change the mood of a look from day to night. She opts for local designers such as Bassike, who are known for their local manufacturing, and Elk, who are champions of responsible materials. Bonner preferences them for their comfortable fits and clean lines. \u201cNo florals or loud colours for me,\u201d she says. When she has to dress up, she turns to the Sydney-based label KitX. \u201cI\u2019m not a shiny, glam feminine type of dresser for any occasion and I love the simple beauty of the fabrics and cuts,\u201d she says. \u201cClean lines and colourways with a twist in the design or print. I like fashion with a little quirk \u2026 but in a subtle or unique way.\u201d For underwear she loves brands that opt for natural materials, such as the Very Good Bra, who are committed to using no plastic in their clothes, and Boody, who work with organically grown bamboo. Design with an edge Lacey-Jade Christie, social editor for LadBible Australia, has several size-inclusive brands she swears by and she says We Are Golden Hour is a plus-size brand to watch. \u201cThe owner, Rhiannon Heritage, has her finger on the pulse of what\u2019s edgy and on trend and isn\u2019t afraid to provide the fat community with designs that most brands shy away from,\u201d she says. \u201cMy current favourites are their mesh tops and their matching sets.\u201d The Melbourne label 17 Sundays is her go-to for denim. \u201cThe team specialise in basics with a bit of an edge,\u201d she says. \u201cI have their jeans in every colour.\u201d And the New Zealand brand Friday Flamingo is her favourite for \u201cbright blazers, sequins and stunning dresses in a bold print\u201d. For workwear and neutrals made from natural fibres, Christie recommends Ecclestone. \u201cThese are ethical designs made with fat people in mind,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favourite item from Ecclestone has to be their tapered trousers in olive.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-12", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Lucianne Tonti", "id": 402, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a545c9459dcbcfb440140b0031b8c703301abc69/0_0_2500_1500/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Don\u2019t be afraid to slouch and always wear trainers: six simple tips for healthier joints from the experts", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/12/dont-be-afraid-to-slouch-and-always-wear-trainers-six-simple-tips-for-healthier-joints-from-the-experts", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.1, "neu": 0.693, "pos": 0.207, "compound": 0.9978}, "body": "The physiotherapist \u2018A simple yoga flow routine will save a world of pain\u2019 Liam Goode, physiotherapist, White Hart Clinic, London Our brains are interested in the easy route and will learn pathways of movement that expend the least amount of energy. This can create imbalances in a joint by overworking muscles in a specific range of rotation. If we want to have healthy joints, we need to combat these repeated movements by keeping our exercise very general. Since nothing in the body is done in isolation, we must build strength across the body. Strength and conditioning programmes are very helpful in engaging all of our muscles and joints, from pilates to yoga, or completing weights exercises in the gym. Find your starting point with the aim of building up to regularly move your joints in as full a range of motion as possible, such as squatting to get your bottom as close to the ground as you can. Ultimately, if the cartilage surrounding our joints doesn\u2019t move enough, it won\u2019t get enough blood flow and it will dry out and crack. The earlier you can build a range of movement into your daily life, the better. If you are in your 20s and reading this, a simple regular yoga flow routine will save you a world of hurt later on. The foot and ankle surgeon \u2018Wear trainers for everything\u2019 Nick Cullen, consultant orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore When it comes to our feet and ankles, what we wear is really important. Part of my mission is to try to persuade everyone to wear solid, broad-soled trainers for everything. If you have to wear a heel, try to offload your weight better with a lower heel or wedges, since the higher the heel the more pressure you put on the balls of the feet which are very prone to problems. The optimal shoe is structured and lace-up; if you have flat feet, you need arch support for stability and with high-arch feet you need a more neutral running shoe. Asics, Brooks and Saucony are all good brands and I would recommend going to a sports shop with a treadmill to decide which shoes fit your foot shape, even if you never run. It is also important that we get the small muscles in our feet working regularly. You can look up toe yoga exercises on YouTube or while you are sitting, press your toes into the ground and hold for 10 seconds. Lots of people also have tight calf muscles, which puts more pressure on the balls of your feet when you are walking, so make sure to stretch your calf with a towel or scarf looped under the ball of the foot and held tight, keeping your knee straight and pointing your toes towards your nose. The orthopaedic surgeon \u2018Run or cycle to avoid replacements\u2019 Prof Alister Hart, chair of orthopaedics, University College London People often think that running will damage their knees, but over the past decade I have conducted studies with the research group Exercise for Science that have shown how distance running can actually be good for rebuilding the health of middle-aged knees, provided injury-prevention exercises are done beforehand. Non-runners shouldn\u2019t be scared of taking up running, since we haven\u2019t seen evidence of the sport damaging joints further than what might be normally expected by middle age. In fact, exercise as a whole has been shown to improve bone quality in the knee by increasing blood supply and providing muscle strength and definition, allowing the surfaces around the joint to move better. Equally, cycling can be very good for working the knees and hips with its simple, inline motion. Building up to 30 minutes of movement on an exercise bike every other day can really help to reduce the destruction of our knee and hip joints. Even though we have metal joints that we can surgically substitute, nothing quite compares to our own bone and cartilage, so we must look after these joints to begin with. The osteopath \u2018Move every 20 to 30 minutes\u2019 John Mallinder, osteopath, Osteopathy London Movement is central to our health. It is essential to keep us strong and flexible. Even great posture won\u2019t prevent potential stiffness or future joint pain without regular movement. Ideally during working hours, especially if you are seated for most of the day, try to move away from your workstation every 20-30 minutes. Walk for a few minutes, make tea, or have a chat with a colleague. By breaking our routine we can become aware of our posture when we sit again and avoid the negative impact of prolonged periods in one position. If your capacity for movement is limited, during these short breaks you can try some gentle shoulder rolls backwards and forwards, or simple seated spinal twists and side bends, all to a level you find comfortable. If your job is active but involves repetitive movements or extended periods in one posture, explore movements in different directions during these breaks to give yourself balance. Discomfort can often prompt the avoidance of movement for fear of causing harm, but waiting to be pain-free before gently exercising is a mistake, as it leads to slower healing, weakness and vulnerability. Regular, gentle movement should always be seen as part of the solution. Seek advice if you are unsure of what is safe for you. The clinical director \u2018Lean on your arms to help your shoulders\u2019 Anju Jaggi, clinical director of therapies, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore The shoulder is inherently the most unstable joint in the body and relies heavily on muscular structure to offer support and stability. We need to strengthen the muscles that move and rotate the shoulder by exercising our arms regularly and doing things that might seem a bit unnatural, such as weight-bearing with our upper arms. By leaning on your desk while you\u2019re seated or leaning your bodyweight through your arms against a wall for 20 minutes per week, we can build our bone density in the shoulder and allow the joint to better align itself. There is also a strong correlation between grip strength and shoulder strength. If you work on your grip, it will have a knock-on effect for helping your shoulder. Squeezing your hand into a tight fist and then releasing to fan your fingers 10 to 15 times per day is a simple and effective exercise. As we age we naturally stiffen, which is why it is so important to change your behaviour if you aren\u2019t exercising and become more aware of your body so you can identify the areas that might need more attention. The musculoskeletal physiotherapist \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid to slouch\u2019 Aoife O\u2019Meara, musculoskeletal physiotherapist, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore A lot of research has been conducted to show that there is no such thing as perfect posture. In fact, if you spend all day sitting with an upright, straight spine, it causes your back and core muscles to work hard and that can eventually cause pain \u2013 it\u2019s like walking around with fists clenched all the time. Since every body is different, there is no true neutral when it comes to posture. Instead, we should prioritise changing posture every 30-40 minutes when seated and encourage mobility in the spine. It is safe to slouch, since there is no evidence that it will cause harm when you move regularly. Equally, when you sleep there is no perfect position to protect your spine: find what feels comfortable, since it is more important to get a good quality of sleep for your overall health. I often find a pillow between the knees works well for patients. If you are experiencing pain, it is important to listen to your body but also to incorporate movement as soon as you can, because long periods of bed rest are ultimately what becomes most damaging for the spine.", "date": "2024-02-12", "section": "Life and style", "author": "As told to Ammar Kalia", "id": 403, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7e630892fde874b018559181012248ed1753d8dd/0_46_5000_3000/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Hi Octane: Sofia Coppola\u2019s starry 90s series feels like a gen X fever dream", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/14/hi-octane-sofia-coppola-tv-series-cast-keanu-reeve-beastie-boys-anna-wintour-comedy-central-where-to-watch", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.078, "neu": 0.71, "pos": 0.211, "compound": 0.9946}, "body": "Sofia Coppola has always lived in the kind of cool girl universe where popular culture records your youth for you. Her \u201cawkward\u201d years were captured when she appeared in Sonic Youth\u2019s 1991 music video Mildred Pierce. Her early interest in fashion was immortalised through her cult clothing line Milk Fed. Her ideas about girlhood were explored in films like Lick the Star and The Virgin Suicides. Even the demise of her young marriage to Spike Jonze resulted in the Oscar-winning Lost in Translation. Or take Hi Octane, her short-lived, star-studded Comedy Central series created with her pal Zoe Cassavetes in 1994. In the arms of any other early twentysomething, that description could sound nightmarish. But like so much of the director\u2019s later work, subjects that should be gnawing (the inner lives of the rich, beautiful and bored) are totally hypnotic. To be fair, the show\u2019s watchability is hugely inflated by Coppola\u2019s network of 90s alternative-It Girls. The hosts, Coppola and Cassavetes, get in trouble for goofing off at Monster Truck school before pulling over to offer Keanu Reeves roadside assistance. The model Jenny Shimizu provides mechanic tips (and hints at a previous three-way with Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista). Andre Leon Talley and Beck ponder the mechanics of sex in a car. In another backseat, Good Will Hunting and My Private Idaho director Gus Van Sant predicts the rise of mobile phone cameras. Off road \u2013 and in an alley behind his apartment \u2013 Thurston Moore hosts an appropriately named regular segment called \u201cThurston\u2019s Alley\u201d, where he interviews the likes of Johnny Ramone, Sylvia Miles and Anna Wintour (although she makes him come to her office). Rumour has it Liv Tyler\u2019s appearance was cut. It all feels like a gen X fever dream. Occasionally, Hi Octane does falter. Watching someone else\u2019s cool friends goof off can get old \u2013 even when the cool friends are the Beastie Boys. But most of the time, the format is addictive. A cynic might say any rich, pretty, popular girl in a 1960s Pontiac could make something similarly appealing \u2013 Coppola\u2019s dad did produce it. But amid the chaos there are glimmers of Coppola\u2019s talents and signatures. Her impeccable taste is signalled with a cameo from a pre-Kids Chlo\u00eb Sevigny at an X-Girl fashion show she produces. Hyper-femme aesthetics are explored and teased through Chanel-clad alter egos. At one point, Karl Lagerfeld tells her to enunciate. At the time of production she was five years away from her directorial debut with The Virgin Suicides but her preoccupation with nostalgia, sex and fame are already clear \u2013 as is her unique view into the intimate and casual lives of famous people. It\u2019s not hard to see the warped perspective of The Bling Ring or Marie Antoinette as Debbie Harry gazes at a portrait of herself escaping a (real-life) brush with Ted Bundy. And despite her infamous early foray into acting, Coppola herself shines. Watching her awkwardly attempt to play bass or mug for a fisheye lens, there\u2019s little confusion as to how she became a mainstay of Pinterest boards the world over. Last year Coppola took back the role of record keeper from her many admirers with the publication of her book, Archive. After a career fascinated with other people\u2019s pasts, the book offered an intimate glimpse into her own. Hopefully the trip down memory lane was rewarding enough to inspire plans for Hi Octane season two. Hi Octane is available to watch on YouTube.

It \u201cliterally made your mouth water\u201d, says Stasia Smith-Turpin, who would head to the Lancaster store after school with friends when she was 16 in the 90s. She recalls how a wave of fragrance would hit her as she entered the shop, and she would test and smell the soaps, creams and potions while planning how to spend her pocket money. Smith-Turpin, 48, would spray herself with dewberry perfume \u2013 the scent of summer berries \u2013 before riding the bus home. One day, to her mother\u2019s horror, she applied too much (\u201cmy arms were literally greasy!\u201d) and \u201capparently she could smell me from the bus stop at the bottom of the hill\u201d, she says. Since The Body Shop was founded in 1976, it has served as a gateway to adolescence for generations of young people like Smith-Turpin. Now she and other consumers feel sadness and regret as the retailer collapses into administration in a move that is likely to lead to significant store closures and job losses. \u201cIt was the beginnings of a scented awakening for most teenage girls, and my god did we smell \u2013 beautiful, but really strong,\u201d says Smith-Turpin, now a management consultant in Hampton. But it wasn\u2019t just the products that attracted Smith-Turpin to The Body Shop. It stood for something: ethical consumption, environmentally sustainable ingredients, an abhorrence of animal testing. The store \u201copened my eyes to many of the political issues I still feel strongly about today\u201d, she says. Smith-Turpin bought a book on vegetarianism from The Body Shop around the time she stopped eating meat at 16. \u201cIt was the spark that made me go and find out more,\u201d she says. The Body Shop in the late 1970s represented the height of cool, recalls Helen Gunn, a 64-year-old retired occupational therapist in Herefordshire. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any shops like it at the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember the delicious smells of apple, dewberry and grapefruit.\u201d She also liked how the business, which now has more than 200 UK stores, was a model for women, and how the founder, Anita Roddick, believed natural cosmetics could be feminist. Gunn \u201creally admired the way she ran her business in a male-dominated world. She was a successful woman in an age where it was unusual for women to make headway in any business.\u201d She adds: \u201cI feel really sad that it has foundered.\u201d Roddick eventually sold up in 2006 to L\u2019Or\u00e9al and the company was eventually bought by the private equity firm Aurelius Group last year in a cut-price deal. In 1985, Sally-Ann Fawcett remembers applying for a job at The Body Shop in Scarborough. \u201cThe competition was ferocious,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone wanted to work in such a cool, trendy shop, and the group interview at a five-star local hotel was akin to a beauty pageant.\u201d Fawcett, 56, was gutted not to be hired. \u201cWe were all so envious of those who were successful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really was the place to be.\u201d Every applicant was given a product as a thank you, and she got a banana shampoo. \u201cIt was the start of a love affair that has lasted 40 years since that day,\u201d Fawcett says. Lara Callister, 42, from the Isle of Man, began visiting The Body Shop as a teen in the 90s. \u201cI loved the whole ethos and style,\u201d she says, adding that she was attracted to its strong values of responsible consumption and anti-animal testing stance. \u201cThe actual products themselves were so fragrant and really useful, I adored their morello cherry lip balm, fuzzy peach and dewberry scented products and peppermint foot lotion,\u201d she says. But Callister says she visited less after the chain\u2019s 2006 sale to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, after which it became \u201cbland and uninviting\u201d. She is \u201cvery sad\u201d but not surprised to hear that it has called in administrators. \u201cAsset stripping has been mentioned and it just leaves you with that sinking feeling of another empty shop for the high street,\u201d she says. Hilary Ellis, a 66-year-old semi-retired career coach, lives in Hove, not far from the first ever Body Shop, which opened in Brighton in 1976. At the time it felt like an \u201ceco-conscious emporium of beauty products \u2013 nowhere else had toiletries, cosmetics and wellbeing products under one roof,\u201d she says. The eye shadows were among Ellis\u2019s favourite products \u2013 they were affordable, subtle and cruelty-free \u2013 as well as the essential oils in little glass tubes. Ellis travelled around for work, \u201cso I carried them everywhere,\u201d she says, with the lavender helping her sleep on planes or in hotels. \u201cIt all went downhill when Anita Roddick died\u201d in 2007, Ellis says. \u201cShe was an entrepreneur with a revolutionary ethical approach.\u201d After being sold to L\u2019Or\u00e9al in 2006, the company was bought by the beauty giant Natura in 2017 before its private equity acquisition in 2023.

Even if you love and care for your partner, you may fantasise about other people or wish they were younger or fitter. Mother nature tricks our brains into only seeing the positives when we start dating, but that wears off over time.\u201d Some people find that loss of sexual connection is a dealbreaker, especially when it\u2019s accompanied by other problems in the relationship. \u201cIf couples get out of the habit of being intimate,\u201d Campbell says, \u201cit can make them more critical of each other\u2019s flaws.\u201d But it is possible to keep love alive, and even reignite that sexual spark. Communicate openly According to psychotherapist Kamalyn Kaur, nothing is more important in relationships than old-fashioned communication. \u201cIf you find the sex is missing, have an open conversation about it. Try bringing it up in a non-pressurised environment \u2013 like when you\u2019re walking or cooking together. This creates a bit of space so you don\u2019t have to answer questions right away.\u201d Taking the time to think about what\u2019s caused the physical rift helps couples engage with what\u2019s going on, and consider other forms of intimacy. It\u2019s something that worked for Claire, 36, who has been with her partner for 10 years. \u201cWhen the sex went from our relationship a couple of years ago, we talked about it openly,\u201d she says. \u201cHe told me that he didn\u2019t fancy me, and I appreciated his honesty. We got together after running a business together so we\u2019d never had that intense honeymoon period. Our relationship was built on mutual trust and enjoying each other\u2019s company, but it got harder during Covid because we had the stress of trying to keep the business going.\u201d They separated briefly, but soon realised they didn\u2019t want to be apart. \u201cUltimately, we are partners in life and have always supported each other in everything. For me, being able to have honest, open communication in a life you\u2019ve built together is more important than sex.\u201d Share your memories and achievements With so much history behind them, Claire found that focusing on their memories and achievements strengthened their bond. \u201cOur relationship is based on achieving things as a team. To support that love, we\u2019ve continued being intimate in other ways, such as hugging, sharing a bed and spending quality time together outside work.\u201d After two years without sexual contact, the intimacy between them is starting to grow. \u201cIt might come back even more when our child leaves home later in life. But for now I appreciate what we have, how well he treats me, and how he supports me through mental health challenges. People think the grass is always greener, but it takes time to build lasting intimacy and I don\u2019t want to throw all that away.\u201d Kaur agrees that celebrating milestones can be a fantastic way to stop partners from taking each other for granted and recognise the evolution of their relationship. \u201cIt can be anniversaries or things you\u2019ve achieved as a couple, such as having children or buying a home together. I recommend writing these things down because it encourages reflection and it helps to build positive memories. You can also try writing down your partner\u2019s best qualities to remind yourself why you were drawn to them in the first place.\u201d Tackle the weak spots in your relationship Unlike food and shelter, sexual chemistry isn\u2019t No 1 in the hierarchy of human needs. Relationships coach Katarina Polonska, who specialises in supporting high-achieving couples, says that grappling to achieve the \u201cbig ticket\u201d items in life, such as a good career or building a home, can mean people deprioritise their partner, leading to a loss of sexual interest. \u201cTo feel in love after the honeymoon period is a choice \u2013 it\u2019s not something we can expect to last,\u201d she says. \u201cTo make that choice, we have to make room to feel desire and love. The first thing I ask couples when they\u2019re losing desire for each other is whether there are any other stressors in their life, such as work or caring duties.\u201d For couples who identify this as a problem, making more time for each other can help them reconnect and regain that sexual chemistry. \u201cAnother common reason that people stop fancying their partner is due to past resentments and unresolved relationship issues. These can be tiny microaggressions, but over time they grow into something bigger.\u201d She recommends that couples take at least 30 minutes each week to try the \u201cthree things\u201d exercise. \u201cYou share three things you appreciate and three things you need the person to know, for example times you didn\u2019t feel seen or heard, or something that has rocked your trust. Then you share three things that you need, such as acts of romance or help around the house. It\u2019s important not to judge, but give each other space to share.\u201d Build an intimacy routine Intimacy is often associated with sex, but Campbell points out that it can be so much more than that. \u201cTo keep a loving relationship going without sex, it\u2019s important to build an intimacy routine, for example hugging and kissing before you go out. Sometimes applying a sex ban can be helpful to take the pressure off completely and see what happens when you try holding hands or just cuddling on the sofa.\u201d She adds that if partners still care about each other, spending quality time together is likely to improve the relationship, and those feelings of sexual chemistry could return \u2013 even after years without it. For some couples, practising intimacy exercises can bring them closer together. Clinical psychologist Dr Patapia Tzotzoli says that mindfulness during intimate moments can help to rebuild attraction between couples. \u201cHugging meditation involves taking a deep breath and visualising your partner 200 years from now. This mental exercise helps people to appreciate that life is precious and enables them to cherish what they have right now.\u201d Through the simple act of staying in the moment, couples shift their attention back to each other and their relationship. \u201cIt can help them to replace the negative feelings with more positive ones and make them more able to interact with each other with kindness and patience.\u201d Try something new One of the reasons that attraction between couples can dwindle is the lack of variety. The mundanity of day-to-day life, coupled with the stress of working can leave little time for excitement. Tzotzoli recommends taking up a new hobby or trying something different. \u201cBy focusing on personal growth, you\u2019re nurturing your own sense of fulfilment. It can enrich each partner\u2019s individuality, which will contribute positively to the relationship.\u201d Over time, that renewed sense of self can lead to increased attraction and appreciation for each other. She also suggests trying new activities as a couple, such as dance classes, cooking classes or anything else that pushes you out of your routine.

But then the Ghanaian government declared 2019 the \u201cyear of return\u201d, inviting African Americans to come home, and Detty December took hold. Africans, British-Ghanaians and those from the wider diaspora soon joined in and the idea exploded into a spectacular annual ingathering, which necessarily means music, parties and cultural conversations everywhere, all the time, vibe on a rolling boil. The largest event is AfroFuture, a two-night stadium festival that attracts more than 40,000 attenders, and it is here I meet the vocalist Black Sherif following a luminous, incendiary headline set. Though a key part of the Afrobeats phenomenon \u2013 the continent\u2019s biggest star, Burna Boy, was so wowed by his track Second Sermon that he demanded to feature on the remix \u2013 Blacko, as he is affectionately known, is not an Afrobeats artist. \u201cHis music is a bridge between the younger and older generation,\u201d says Nana Kwasi Wiafe, creator of the Very Ghanaian brand and stylist on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Black Is King. \u201cHe carries the authentic sound of Ghana, highlife, merging it with the modern sounds \u2013 drill, reggae, rap \u2013 that inspire him.\u201d Though categorisation melts anyway as soon as Blacko sings, his voice clear, urgent and transporting whether in Twi or English. That voice has ensured him considerable recent success, including performances at the Mobo awards, Wireless festival and a BET award for best international flow, and he\u2019s now forging further links with the UK \u2013 his new single features British pop singer Mabel and in a few days he\u2019ll walk at London fashion week. It feels incredible, he says, \u201cunderstanding the influence my craft has on people all over the globe\u201d. Born Mohammed Ismail Sharrif, Blacko hails from Konongo-Zongo, a mining community in Ghana\u2019s gold-endowed Ashanti region. When he was 10, his seamstress mother left to work in Greece (\u201cI felt a part of me was missing \u2013 I miss my mother so much to this day\u201d) and his peripatetic childhood thereafter informs his vivid, visual storytelling. \u201cI try to be 100% vulnerable,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting stories together don\u2019t be like a big fight because I just say whatever happened, making it a bit more dramatic. Every time I\u2019m writing music, I\u2019m writing a play. I call it \u2018drama in a voice pipe\u2019.\u201d The protagonist of which is almost always him, examining his failings, most famously in signature track Kwaku the Traveller. \u201cOf course I fucked up!\u201d he sings. \u201cWho never fuck up? Hands in the air \u2026 no hands!\u201d On another track, Yaya, the lyric \u201cI\u2019m illegal in my own town, in my own city\u201d is a cry of alienation. In working through his struggles without shame, Blacko \u2013 also a University of Ghana psychology student who confesses he doesn\u2019t have \u201ctime to go to class\u201d \u2013 legitimises the same feelings in listeners who may otherwise be disinclined to turn their gaze inward. On recent single January 9th, released for his 22nd birthday, he sings a lullaby to himself: \u201cPain in my heart but I\u2019m doing just fine.\u201d Just as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Break My Soul has her \u201csleeping real good\u201d as an act of resistance, Blacko celebrates the hard-won ordinariness of being all right \u2013 particularly valuable following Black Lives Matter and during a male mental health epidemic. On another recent single, Fallen Angel, he voices both halves of a gorgeously harmonic, philosophical and intimate dialogue with himself: \u201cYou go be a slave to your flaws / Will you stay on the floor? / I wanna see you at the top \u2026 one thing I\u2019ve learned to do is to take care of my people, that is all I want for you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s created with a big red love,\u201d says the track\u2019s producer, Smallgod. \u201cIts message comes from a deep place in Blacko\u2019s spirit and resonates with everyone whether religious or not. Everyone is looking for that light.\u201d For all the pain, the dominant theme in Blacko\u2019s work is hope: warning people of life\u2019s pitfalls before suggesting ways to combat them. \u201cHe\u2019s so pure at heart,\u201d says Smallgod, \u201cand very particular about where he goes, where he stays, and what he does. And he\u2019s very smart at the age of 22 \u2013 too smart for that age. Some people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and they expect you to teach them \u2013 but he knows everything.\u201d Because his demeanour \u2013 warm, gentle, joyful, genuine \u2013 fits with the Ghanaian character, people seem to love Blacko the bloke as much as Blacko the artist. \u201cI feel this!\u201d he says. \u201cI keep myself as real as I can. I try to make people\u2019s days.\u201d So he pays food bills for street kids and maternity bills for impoverished women, also taking time to advise the many younger versions of himself he encounters. \u201cI speak to them like I\u2019m speaking to my peers,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they need to know it\u2019s not always sweetness \u2026 it doesn\u2019t get easier. I be real to them, tell them about their struggles, everything, I tell them: \u2018Look at me, keep going.\u2019 Love it!\u201d Live at AfroFuture, though, it\u2019s all positivity, Blacko showing that he can dance as well as sing. He closes the show with a mantra \u2013 \u201cOil in my head, everything I touch is blessed, all I see is blessings and no man can stop this\u201d \u2013 repeated over and over with the intentionality of a preacher, crowd duly hollering it back in unison. \u201cSometimes I make music and describe it with colours,\u201d he says, \u201cand Oil in My Head is white and blue because it just feels refreshing. Any time I play it I go outside and act it, because it\u2019s a prayer. I manifest in Oil in My Head, appreciating I\u2019m anointed.

Blending jazz and classical influences into pop to tell retro, soft-focus fantasies full of \u201cwine-stained lips\u201d, handsome strangers and heartbreak, even Laufey\u2019s most cynical songs are cinematic romances. On Dreamer, the 24-year-old claims to quit dating for good \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m throwing in my hat / I can\u2019t take another lifeless little chat!\u201d \u2013 yet the airy arrangement adds a theatrical wink, as if it\u2019s the scene before the Hollywood heroine is finally swept off her feet.

The multiple casts that have come and gone over the years have inevitably resulted in shifts of emphasis and sometimes mood \u2013 some of its past outings have felt fractionally more barbed than on this occasion. It remains marvellously witty and astute, particularly in its depiction of a world where everyone seems to be on the make, but we\u2019re now less immediately aware, perhaps, of the grotesque, slightly sinister way which Dr Bartolo (Simon Bailey) immures Rosina (Anna Devin) in a house full of specimen jars and barbaric-looking medical equipment. And in the past, the ending was sometimes more ambiguous in suggesting the consequences, familiar from Mozart\u2019s Marriage of Figaro, of Rosina\u2019s eventual marriage to an aristocrat she has only ever encountered in successive disguises, and therefore never really known or understood. The cast this time around is really lovely, though, a fine ensemble, well balanced and superbly integrated. Charles Rice\u2019s excellent Figaro dominates, as he should, handsome of voice and presence, with mocking irony and glee never far from his tone, a man with his eye to the main chance, wordly wise and affectionate. Devin, a soprano Rosina rather than the more usual mezzo, is very much his equal, confounding him with her cunning, and braving Bartolo\u2019s threats with supreme unconcern. The ease in her upper registers and her coloratura are striking, too, particularly in the lesson scene. Bailey, meanwhile, blusters, rages and can be very funny, though his absurdity also keeps us just the right side of empathy: his aria is superbly done, the words clear and telling in the central patter section, where they can all too frequently blur. Innocent Masuku makes an elegant, bright-toned Almaviva; Alastair Miles\u2019s Basilio sounds good in his calumny aria; and Lesley Garrett, who sang Rosina in this production 25 years ago, now has great fun as Berta, the frustrated housekeeper with the hots for Bartolo. Roderick Cox conducts a taut, energetic account of the score with some exactingly precise playing.

I am usually up first, and always take him a coffee in bed; at night, I always go into the bathroom and find my toothpaste on my toothbrush. When we walk to our local cinema, I notice that he stands back to let me go first where the footpath narrows and he always deseeds the tomatoes because he knows I prefer them that way. Samantha Briggs, project manager, Somerset Before we became a couple, I regularly used to write my (now) wife\u2019s name on the steamed-up shower screen which, looking back, seems a little teenage obsessive. Now married, having been together for five years, I continue to do it every morning with a love heart next to it, so that whenever she goes in the bathroom after me she feels remembered and loved. Ed, Guernsey My husband bought me an umbrella with a lifetime guarantee before I set off to work in London. He researched one which opened and closed easily, with a sturdy handle, in my favourite colour, and which fitted in my favourite handbag. It\u2019s truly been the most understated present that I\u2019ve received. Every time it drizzled I\u2019d reach for my trusted brolly and feel loved and cherished. Ketvi, Sydney, Australia My husband picks out and saves the whole peanuts from bags of salted peanuts, because he knows I like them. It sounds a bit silly \u2013 me liking whole peanuts that taste the same as half peanuts \u2013 but he picks them out anyway and this small gesture feels very romantic. Sharon Evans, church administrator, Bedford Whether reading or sleeping or watching TV in our king-size bed, our personal territories are well defined. So an occasional, gentle, fleeting footsie tap says \u201chey, babe\u201d. While a conventional cuddle would be nice, his body temperature is so high that after five minutes I break out in a sweat and we are both reduced to giggles. A footsie sends the message, no sweat. Michael, Atlanta, US My partner is not one for romantic gestures really, but he is always doing the small things for me. This past weekend I absent-mindedly mentioned my car was low on screenwash, and while getting ready this morning (he leaves earlier than me) I got a text saying he topped it up before he left. He is always checking on my car to make sure it\u2019s in perfect shape so that I never have issues. Samantha Morrison, research analyst, Ottawa, Canada My husband can basically eat what he wants, whereas I have to work harder to stay in shape. When he makes cheese on toast, which I love, but I\u2019m having a sad salad, he\u2019ll sprinkle the crispy bits of cheese that fall into the grill pan on to my lunch when I\u2019m not looking because he knows I love them. I do and I love him for it. It\u2019s the little thoughts that make a big impact. Rachel, Hertfordshire Whichever one of us is the first one to go to bed, we lie on the other\u2019s side of the bed. Then when the second person comes to bed, their side is warmed and ready for them. Then the first person goes back to their own (cold) side. We both do this nice gesture for the other, and gain pleasure from giving and receiving. RDG, retired, US My girlfriend and I live on different continents and we send each other a voice note for the other to wake up to the next morning. Usually it\u2019s just some rambling about what we\u2019ve been up to or encouragement for what the other has on that day, but waking up and hearing her voice tell me she loves me first thing makes me feel so connected to her, despite her being miles away. Daisy, sustainability charity worker, London When I used to work night shifts in a hospice, I was always passing my husband going to work as I arrived home exhausted but, when I got into bed, I often found a freshly prepared hot-water bottle there. That used to make me so happy. Fiona, nurse, Cumbria Every Thursday, I drop off my daughter at ballet and, on the walk home, I buy my husband a spring roll from the Chinese takeaway across the road. These are his absolute favourite but he never seems to expect it \u2013 he always seems surprised. Pamela Bilo, Gloucester I like to leave little cards in my wife\u2019s bag or desk at work. Sometimes it takes her weeks to find them. Some are handmade, some are bought; it\u2019s a tradition that goes back to when we were first married and I had to go away for a week for work (the longest time we\u2019ve ever been apart) and I sent her a card every day. I\u2019m crap on the phone, so prefer to write love notes! Theo, teacher, La Nuc\u00eda, Spain Perimenopause has been just awful \u2013 the hot flashes have been sudden, overwhelming and almost stop me in my tracks. My extremely sweet and considerate partner has developed a tactic for when one hits: as soon as he notices my distress he surreptitiously blows a stream of cool air into my face or neck. He doesn\u2019t draw attention to himself while he does this either, and the cool air makes a huge difference. It means I can stay at the table with friends, keep watching a show or cope in a shop. Emma, the Netherlands My husband started giving me pedicures in front of the TV when I was pregnant with my daughters and couldn\u2019t reach my feet myself. Twenty years on, he still isn\u2019t afraid to get his hands on my Frodo feet and takes care of my toes weekly while we watch Only Connect. What a man! Cathy Charman, executive assistant, London Every time I buy my wife a book, I make a wee bookmark for her to use with it. It\u2019s always got something to make her smile on it \u2013 a love token instead of a book token. She gets them out from time to time to remember where we were and what we were doing when she read a particular book \u2013 she\u2019s kept the bookmarks, even when she\u2019s disposed of some of the books. Brian, retired, Dorset My husband once bought me a toaster for Christmas. Previously, we had a toaster from Sweden, designed to take Swedish-sized slices of bread, which are about two-thirds the size of a UK slice. Every morning, I would groan about the top third being un-toasted. In buying me a new toaster (with a bagel setting!) my husband saw it less about the toasting of the bread and more about the removal of one of life\u2019s little annoyances. When I look at my toaster, I feel very loved and understood. Victoria Harris, Dorset I\u2019m quite a self-conscious person, so if I trip over while walking down a busy street, my partner will purposely trip in a comical and over-the-top Basil Fawlty way to \u201coutdo\u201d me, and it makes me laugh every time.

It\u2019s showing a few signs of being unsustainable, as those player numbers have dropped off in recent weeks and the developers reveal the eye-watering cost of keeping servers online for so many people (almost $6m a year), but it\u2019s still in with a shot of being 2024\u2019s biggest game in terms of pure revenue. There\u2019s something a little unsavoury about Palworld that has other developers and critics wrinkling their noses. It\u2019s not just the ick of turning guns on creatures that are, unlike Minecraft\u2019s blocky animals, designed to look cute. Its character designs are so close to Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s that it has sparked allegations of plagiarism, with some 3D models of the game\u2019s creatures aligning improbably closely with those from recent Pok\u00e9mon games. (The Pok\u00e9mon Company is investigating, while Pocketpair\u2019s CEO, Takuro Mizobe, said that Palworld \u201ccleared legal reviews\u201d, and that the studio has \u201cabsolutely no intention of infringing upon the intellectual property of other companies\u201d.) Its lead developer has also been cheerfully outspoken about using AI tools, which is a super-unpopular opinion among everyone who works on games in 2024, except certain company executives. The game also borrows ideas from several other ones without bringing all that much of its own to the table. It\u2019s not Pok\u00e9mon that comes to mind as you play Palworld, but Ark: Survival Evolved \u2013 a nine-year-old survival game that has you taming dinosaurs, alongside the usual gathering, building and crafting. Once you\u2019ve captured a creature it is pressed into indentured servitude on your base, or comes along to battle with you out in the wilds. There is nothing here that you haven\u2019t seen in several other survival games, but Palworld makes it totally frictionless, removing a lot of the busywork between you and the next shiny upgrade. Like Genshin Impact, also an enormous hit, it takes familiar game tropes and makes playing so easy and compelling that it\u2019s hard to put it down. It helps that there are no other players trying to ruin your fun, as there are in Ark, or Rust, another survival game in which there\u2019s always someone ready to smash you with a rock and take your stuff. Player v player competition doesn\u2019t currently exist in Palworld (it\u2019s planned for in later versions); instead, you cooperate with other players on a server. The game\u2019s attitude to its creatures is cutthroat \u2013 they exist to be killed, enslaved or eaten \u2013 but its attitude to players is very welcoming. There are reasons it\u2019s so popular. Nonetheless, I find Palworld hard to like. It\u2019s soulless, and anecdotally appears to have a lot of kids in its 19-million-strong player base, when this is not a game made with children in mind. Compared especially with the Pok\u00e9mon games from which its creature design draws such obvious inspiration, it is violent and amoral. In Pok\u00e9mon, a children\u2019s classic that has evolved over 25 years, your creatures are companions, not just pets but friends. You battle them for sport, sure, which is not something Peta would approve of, but they don\u2019t get hurt, there are no weapons and you certainly don\u2019t eat them. Palworld is closer to what panicked parents and reactionary preachers of the late 1990s thought Pok\u00e9mon was like, back when Time Magazine was running scaremongering features headlined Beware of the Pok\u00e9mania and Christian organisations were arguing that Pikachu was a literal manifestation of Satan. \u201cMonsters make for disquieting playmates. No matter how toylike and frivolous they may appear, monsters are unnatural and, in the end, deal in unresolved fear,\u201d opined Time, in 1999. \u201cBut monsters also have a way with children. Consider the suspicious charms of the Pok\u00e9mon creatures \u2026 The four-to-12-year-old set can exhibit the most troubling fanaticism about Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d It is laughable to read these lines now, but I remember when this was the tone with which video games were always talked about in mainstream media: as a symptom of some deep spiritual sickness in children of the 90s. Anyway, I\u2019m not here to start a moral panic about Palworld \u2013 it\u2019s cynical, but it\u2019s also mostly harmless and undeniably compelling. I wouldn\u2019t let my seven-year-old play it, but anyone over 12 will have seen worse on YouTube. Perhaps there is nothing new under the sun, and the majority of breakout games from here on out will be repackaged ideas we\u2019ve seen 10 times before. But I remain hopeful that the next unexpected hit I play this year will leave me with a smile, rather than an unpleasant taste in my mouth. What to play It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, so I must recommend a game about love, a topic that many games do not confidently tackle. Dream Daddy is a dating game in which you play a single father looking for love with one of seven other eligible single fathers in your new neighbourhood. Before it came out in 2017, many thought that it would be an overdone joke, but it remains one of the most sincere and unexpectedly touching dating games around. Your teen daughter often helps you work up the courage to talk to your dad of choice, and it frequently segues into gently surreal mini-games where you, for instance, try to dazzle your date with competitive pride in your kids\u2019 achievements. It turns out to be a game about the love between parent and child, as well as the budding romances between you and the hot neighbourhood bachelors, all of whom have their own problems and stories that are handled with humour and compassion.

Disney has invested $1.5bn(!) in Epic Games as part of a deal to create a \u201cnew persistent universe [that] will offer a multitude of opportunities for consumers to play, watch, shop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and more\u201d. Sounds like that means more than a few more Star Wars skins in Fortnite.

Question Block This week\u2019s question comes from Rosie from New Zealand: What games for the Switch do you recommend for a mature teen who plays the likes of Dead By Daylight, Left for Dead, Hitman and Red Dead Redemption on PC? I do love the Switch, but it\u2019s not great for teens (or adults whose inner child is less close to the surface). A combination of its family friendly reputation and lesser power compared with the Xbox and PlayStation leaves it lacking in purely adult-oriented games, whether that\u2019s muliplatform staples such as Call of Duty or the PlayStation 5\u2019s exclusives in the vein of The Last of Us and God of War. That said: the original Red Dead Redemption is on Switch now, and Metro Redux is a duo of interesting post-apocalyptic shooters that holds up well. If they are interested in something more fantasy-flavoured with exciting combat, they may also enjoy The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or Dark Souls. For old-school shooter/horror vibes, there are also Bioshock and Resident Evil collections on Switch. Most of these games are rereleases or remakes: alas, the latest multiplayer shooter or horror games are not to be found on this console, but you\u2019ll easily find them on PC.

The genre didn\u2019t so much reboot as mutate for a new streaming home with a now distinctive style: baseline watchable, sheen-y, disposable. I\u2019ve reviewed probably a dozen of them and can only recall a handful. The few that have stuck \u2013 To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before, Set It Up \u2013 have endured in large part because of its stars\u2019 charisma, without which a romcom has little hope. Such was the case with 2019\u2019s Someone Great, a middling movie elevated to memorable by the breezy charm of Gina Rodriguez. The erstwhile Jane the Virgin star has a natural affinity for the romantic lead: megawatt smile, puppy-dog eyes, caffeinated energy, a preternaturally sunny presence striking the highly prized sweet spot between gorgeous and relatable. She is deservedly the main attraction of Players, a new Netflix romcom released on Valentine\u2019s Day starring Rodriguez as Mack, a Brooklyn-based sports journalist looking to up her playbook of romantic entrapment. As with Amazon\u2019s concurrently released Upgraded, starring Camila Mendes, Players, directed by Trish Sie (Pitch Perfect 3) from a script by Whit Anderson, is another case of a veteran small-screen star\u2019s magnetism outweighing a film\u2019s more discordant or patently ridiculous elements. In this case, the many schemes to score a one-night stand run by Mack and her crew \u2013 her fellow journalist and enthusiastic straight-man Adam (Damon Wayans Jr), the catty, carnal Brannagan (Augustus Prew) and Brannagan\u2019s somewhat hapless brother Little (Joel Courtney, of Netflix\u2019s The Kissing Booth movies). They\u2019re sports people \u2013 Mack especially is a diehard Yankees fan \u2013 for whom sex and romance is pure strategy and payoff, Xs and Os on the whiteboard. Players is at times too sitcom-y in its abstraction \u2013 everything is a play, sex the score, nothing for keeps. (At least it shows some sex on-screen, though it\u2019s of the vigorous, slapstick variety.) That is, until Mack beds Nick Marshall (Lucifer\u2019s Tom Ellis), an award-winning war journalist whose accolades, experience and money spark envy, a feeling sometimes indistinguishable from lust, or love. Suddenly it\u2019s the playoffs: convert a one-night stand into a romance because, as Mack puts it, \u201cI\u2019m 33 and I\u2019m exhausted and I want an adult.\u201d Or as Brannagan describes the task in one of the film\u2019s many funny-ish bits on modern dating, \u201cundoing simple dick brain\u201d. The lengths that the generally winsome crew go to lock it down, up to and including stalking and binders full of personal data, are outlandish (and occasionally humorous), but the stakes feel real. Though Mack is a caricature of a guys\u2019 girl, the type to drink tall boy Sapporos, eat greasy Chinese takeout out of the carton and watch wrestling, who hits the bar every night looking hot and toned but never works out, Rodriguez keeps her yearning \u2013 for love, for professional success, for change and direction \u2013 at the surface. Anderson\u2019s script is savvy enough to render Nick as neither villain nor flawless catch \u2013 he\u2019s an adult person, and as such more complicated than his stats. But who hasn\u2019t mistook the idea of someone for love? Players is self-aware enough, too, to poke fun at its own holes, such as how Mack has no female friends, which introduces the receptionist Ashley (YouTuber Liza Koshy) and Adam\u2019s new girlfriend Claire (SNL\u2019s Ego Nwodim) into the crew. (To be fair, as Mack says, it\u2019s difficult to make friends as an adult.) Sie\u2019s direction, though at times reaching for too much flair, is solid and unusually grounded for this micro-genre; the Brooklyn of this film, bowling alleys and pool bars and the promenade near the bridge, maps on to the actual borough. In the storied history of romcoms disconnected from any real understanding of journalism, Players has more substance than most \u2013 there\u2019s a real grit to Mack\u2019s career as a local sports journalist, though it\u2019s hard to believe there\u2019s a full Brooklyn in-office newspaper with a local sports section in the year 2024. (Much about the movie, from the journalism to the fashion to the attempts to couple the Netflix aesthetic with on-location gravitas, feels more suited for the mid-2010s.) Still, some things are evergreen. Rodriguez\u2019s Mack is easy to root for; her confused attempts to settle in her early 30s, however far-fetched in practice, emotionally lived in. Wayans, who honed his comedic timing on the spiritually related sitcom New Girl, is well-suited as the long-overlooked best friend turned possible romantic interest. Ellis, as Nick, is suitably handsome, debonair and not all that he\u2019s cracked up to be. Such is the game of dating. Players may trip on its gimmicks at times, but there\u2019s enough lived experience beneath the rapid-fire quips to work. For a streaming economy romcom, particularly of the Netflix variety, it\u2019s batting far above average.

I joined a sketch group, went to the Edinburgh fringe, and then kept doing that for years. It\u2019s a good place to try and get better, to work out what you\u2019re doing. Who were your early influences? When I first moved to London I watched Paul Foot a lot. You need to see Paul Foot. He\u2019s unique. I would think: \u201cWhat on earth could I do that would be half as funny as that?\u201d Can you recall a gig so bad, it\u2019s now funny? It doesn\u2019t become that funny with time. I did do one in a pub, in London. Pindrop silence. After about two minutes the compere walked slowly towards me through the aisle. Then he stood right in front of me, staring at me, so I finished up. But I\u2019m not laughing that much recalling it. What\u2019s one of the strangest encounters with a fan you\u2019ve had? My train to Edinburgh had to terminate in Newcastle because of some gales. I needed to get to Edinburgh to do a gig. I was negotiating with a taxi driver, then another man who also needed to get to Scotland asked if he could join. Then he suddenly looked stressed and took his earphones out. He was listening to me on a podcast. So, I mean quite strange for me. I\u2019d say very strange for him. A cab driver asks what you do. You say: \u201cComedian.\u201d They ask you to tell them a joke. What do you say? Yeah, you see, that\u2019s a rookie error. You do not volunteer that information. Protect yourself. Say you work in education. When they say \u201cteacher?\u201d say \u201cno, I\u2019m involved in updating the curriculum\u201d. Anything, just shut it down. Avoid comedy, absolute minefield. They\u2019ll be asking if you\u2019ve met Rob Beckett next. Preshow rituals? I used to be worse. I used to walk the same route, go in the same shop, buy the same thing, arrive at the same time \u2026 all that. It felt very important. Nowadays, I still like to walk to the gig where possible. And I like to have a pint before I go on. Best heckle? Heckles are rare thank God. They\u2019re not that useful. I\u2019ve had decent \u201ccontributions\u201d. The other day someone announced he was looking into buying a gong. You\u2019re about to publish your fifth volume of poetry, Chapters. What should readers expect? Well, it\u2019s beautifully designed, by my friend Emily Juniper. It\u2019s full of poems from the last 18 months. And there\u2019s also a bit of dialogue between me and Emily as we discuss what should go in the book etc. Meta. Where do you find you material? Anywhere. There\u2019s always something happening, and if not there\u2019s the old imagination to fall back on. It\u2019s good to write in interesting places: airports, hospitals, things like that. I like writing in the pub, but then the poems tend to be about the pub. There\u2019s quite a lot of those in the book. What are you currently excited for? My friend Tom Basden and I shot a film over the summer. No knowing if it\u2019s any good but Carey Mulligan\u2019s in it so there\u2019s a limit to how bad it can be. It\u2019s been 17 years in the making, so we\u2019re happy it\u2019s on the verge. Do you have a comedy hero? There\u2019s a lot. Been watching a lot of Richard Briers recently. He\u2019s fantastic. Such a good actor, so much heart, funny in such a beautiful way. And a hero not in comedy?

I certainly thought I was over this kind of thing, yet, somehow, every Sunday evening, I find that I am suddenly enormously invested in people making novelty teapots out of clay. Clearly there is still plenty of life in the format yet. Enter Bring the Drama, a noble, sometimes earnest, often lovely quest to give wannabe actors of all ages a shot at fulfilling their dreams. It is hosted by Bill Bailey, who chivvies things along nicely, though the real star is the fair but stern casting director Kelly Valentine Hendry, who is there to put the eight ambitious amateurs through their professional paces. \u201cThis industry is skewed towards privilege,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe that has to change.\u201d There\u2019s actually little mention of class, at least directly, but it is evident that, for one reason or another, the eight finalists did not feel able to pursue acting as a professional career. Some say this was financial, others cultural, while some simply did not know where to begin. Here, they are offered the same sorts of opportunities they might have had access to if they went to drama school. They get an acting coach, auditions, and at the end of the series \u2013 for the three standout contestants \u2013 a showcase performance, attended by agents and other professionals. The show\u2019s success relies on the audience rooting for the amateurs, and, fittingly, they have been very well cast. This might be the post-Traitors effect, but it continues to be refreshing to see more of a broad age range taking part. The actors here range from 22 to 67, and as a result, their stories are nicely varied. Ex-police officer George, 62, says that he always wanted to be an actor. When he retired, he set up a local drama group, but explains that he is from a \u201ctough\u201d family and that showing his emotions does not come naturally to him. When he gets on to a set and the cameras are on, however, there is no stopping him. Lizzie, 26, is now a civil servant, but dropped out of university to give acting a go and worked as a cleaner, in retail and in a call centre to support herself. She says that her mother wanted her to be a doctor, but hopes that one day, at least, she might be able to play one. Each week, the actors get to audition, and those who are successful go on to recreate a scene from one of the UK\u2019s biggest dramas. They\u2019re not auditioning to be in the shows, exactly, but to go on set and film a famous moment, as directed by one of the stars of the show. So in the first episode, they all trot off to Elstree, to replay the scene from EastEnders in which Sonia saves Ben Mitchell from his collapsed lung, while Phil and Linda look on and panic. Natalie Cassidy, who plays Sonia, directs them with kindness and compassion. Soap acting requires heightened emotions, we are told, but as the aspiring actors are new to the game, their interpretation of \u201cheightened\u201d veers from kitchen-sink realism to \u201cYou ain\u2019t my muvva!\u201d extremes. Hendry doesn\u2019t pull any punches. \u201cI thought that audition was \u2026 adequate,\u201d she says. To be fair, she has forewarned them that rejection is par for the course. It\u2019s clear that a bit of tough love is nothing compared with what they would face in the real world. One issue with a programme that is mostly about the acting craft is that your interest in the process of learning to emote may depend on how invested you are in the skills required to be a professional actor. Similarly, most people will tell you that film and TV sets are pretty tedious places to be, once the novelty has worn off. They mostly involve a lot of standing around in a padded jacket, waiting for the catering van to serve up a jacket potato. This sort of thing has worked before. The now Oscar-nominated Jessie Buckley got her break on I\u2019d Do Anything, the Andrew Lloyd Webber-led hunt for a cast of an Oliver! stage production. Bring The Drama is gentle \u2013 it\u2019s very pleasant to watch, rather than a Queen Vic-worthy melodrama \u2013 but it is important. Acting is far too skewed towards privilege. If that is such a problem in the real world that it takes a new TV competition series to address it, then we should take it as a warning sign. If only wealthy and privately educated actors get access to such opportunities, then something significant will be lost before we even know that it has gone.

Midsummer stagings are light and magical, Night shows rather darker. Eleanor Rhode\u2019s RSC revival is driven by Dream, crucially incorporating the sub-categories of nightmare and erotic fantasy, including the rather niche reverie of sex with a donkey. Characters mash, worlds invert, flames burst from fingers, people move backwards (inflecting Tenet and Christopher Nolan\u2019s dreamscape movie Inception), and surreal moments include one that resembles an explosion in a children\u2019s indoor play pit. Bally Gill\u2019s charismatic doubling of Athenian Duke Theseus and faery king Oberon \u2013 matched by Sirine Saba\u2019s sparky pairing of Hippolyta and faery queen Titania \u2013 strongly suggest that what we are seeing in the wood scenes is the nocturnal consequence of a big Greek pre-wedding dinner. In this reading, the elf Puck \u2013 athletically and musically played by Premi Tamang, replacing Rosie Sheehy, indisposed on press night \u2013 becomes a Freudian blurring of daughters, lovers and childhood fairytales. The non-dream scenes are also strikingly earthy. In the workers\u2019 play-within-the-play, Shakespeare, in casting someone as a Wall, enjoys joking about what the \u201chole\u201d in such a barrier might be, but this production doubles down on the entendre. Emily Cundick\u2019s Snout / Wall and Mathew Baynton\u2019s Bottom / Pyramus will have required the ingenuity of the credited intimacy directors. Baynton, due to his roles in the great TV comedies Ghosts and Horrible Histories, will draw younger and school audiences. They are very lucky to see a performer able to make Shakespeare\u2019s artisan comedy \u2013 frequently laborious now \u2013 genuinely funny. Via parodic voices (including past RSC acting styles), silly walks and too-loud outfits, he reaches an uproariously gory Pyramus death scene, stretching every part of his body including his tongue. Beneath the comedy, there is also the cruelty of a plot in which couples are tricked together or apart by a \u201clove juice\u201d. Under its influence, Ryan Hutton\u2019s laddish Lysander kisses his erstwhile partner, Dawn Sievewright\u2019s sarky Hermia, and recoils and retches as if he has just French-kissed a skunk. Due to the GCSE syllabus and its crowd-pleasing title, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is one of the most performed Shakespeare plays. But this version consistently feels fresh, helped by Helen Monks\u2019s Rita (in the original Peter) Quince, a more deluded amateur theatrical than Lynda Snell in The Archers, and Boadicea Ricketts\u2019 bold proud Helena. A production\u2019s panache is easily attributed to a director but this feels clearly a team effort, with Lucy Osborne\u2019s design, John Bulleid\u2019s illusions, Matt Daw\u2019s lighting and Pete Malkin\u2019s sound also excelling in the dazzling inception. It feels fair to see it again, when the unfortunate Ms Sheehy is restored, but to do so will be a late winter dream.

The British publishing company told investors that its profits for the year would be ahead of December expectations, attributing much of this to the release of Maas\u2019s latest book, House of Flame and Shadow. The novel, which was released on 30 January, is the third book in Maas\u2019s series that follows Bryce Quinlan, a half human, half fairy-like creature, in the fantasy Crescent City. Maas\u2019s \u201cromantasy\u201d books have gained huge popularity and House of Flame and Shadow became the number one bestseller in the US, UK, Australia and a number of other countries. In the UK, it became the third-fastest-selling fantasy novel since records began, with 44,761 copies sold in its first week. The company said the new release had also driven demand for the previous 15 books written by Maas for Bloomsbury. The publisher, which is best known for publishing the Harry Potter series, said it expected to post pre-tax profits well ahead of the consensus market expectations, which put profits at \u00a337.2m for the year up to 29 February, on a turnover of \u00a3291.4m. The analyst Investec updated its forecasts for the company on Wednesday, predicting annual profits of \u00a348.1m and a turnover of \u00a3329.3m. The shares rose nearly 10% to 539p, the highest point since the company listed in 1994. The publisher currently has a deal for six more titles from Maas. Her popularity has been driven by an increased presence on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, with fans sharing their love for the books with followers. Other authors in the \u201cromantasy\u201d genre, which mixes fantasy and romance, continue to experience high level of sales. The Fourth Wing series by Rebecca Yarros is popular. Her book Iron Flame recently became the bestselling fantasy book since records began, selling 57,055 in its first week last November. Nigel Newton, the chief executive of Bloomsbury, said the \u201cexceptionally strong trading period\u201d was driven by increasing demand for fantasy fiction. \u201cSarah J Maas is a publishing phenomenon and we are very fortunate to have signed her up with her first book 13 years ago. \u201cHer books have a huge audience which continues to grow, backed by major Bloomsbury promotional campaigns, driving strong word-of-mouth recommendation, particularly through TikTok and Instagram channels,\u201d said Newton.

But when he was invited to play at Cosmic Slop, a 200-capacity party tucked away in a former brass and iron works in Leeds, he knew he had to go. \u201cWord was circulating: \u2018you\u2019ve gotta go and check out the system\u2019,\u201d he recalls, referencing the now-legendary hand-built speaker rig, revered by underground heroes such as Theo Parrish and Bradley Zero. Eventually, he made the trip and pledged to return before his set had even finished. He\u2019s now played an estimated 30 times: \u201cAfter all the years of DJing, it\u2019s one of the places I long to go back to.\u201d This tiny northern club night has made a strong impression on many since it started in 2009, and not just for its sound system. What was supposed to be a one-off fundraiser quickly caught on and became beloved for its pairing of great music with community action. Each party is run in support of the resident charity at Cosmic Slop\u2019s venue: Hope House \u2013 MAP provides alternative education for West Yorkshire kids at risk of exclusion from the mainstream school system. During the week, the venue runs workshops and classes in the adjacent rooms. \u201cThat\u2019s the strange thing about Slop, it\u2019s one of the best clubs in the world but it\u2019s actually just a party to support a charity that\u2019s doing really important work,\u201d says Floating Points, real name Sam Shepherd. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\u201d But in 2017, Cosmic Slop faced the threat of closure as the Grade II-listed building was put up for sale, to be turned into flats. \u201cWe could\u2019ve just lost it all,\u201d says co-founder Tom Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s got consistently harder for spaces like this to exist, and the kind of the support we offer for young people has got harder and harder to provide.\u201d There\u2019s a real devotion from both sides of the booth: high-profile DJs, including Four Tet, Mr Scruff and Caribou, play for free in order to maximise the funds raised, while each party prompts queues along the otherwise nondescript street before the guest is even announced. By 11.30pm, the door staff have to operate a one-in one-out policy. But despite the exclusivity and the audiophile set-up, it\u2019s far from a stiff, chin-stroking atmosphere. With curtains and lampshades framing the room, fresh fruit available at the DIY bar and a team of infectiously friendly staff, it could almost be mistaken for someone\u2019s living room. \u201cIt\u2019s like the antithesis of everything commercial in club culture,\u201d says Gilles Peterson, who first played at Cosmic Slop in 2017. \u201cYou walk into certain places and you can just see the love, care and attention that the promoters and organisers put into it. It rubs off on to the people and so you transfer immediately into that vibe as the DJ. That is the perfect scenario for me.\u201d The open music policy means that punters can hear anything from rare jazz and disco to modern trap music, threaded together by mood rather than genre or BPM. \u201cOn a big system like that, and with an open minded crowd that have come knowing what it\u2019s all about, I can play all the stuff I really wanna play,\u201d says Shepherd. \u201cI like playing music that was designed for dancefloors but I also really like playing music that was definitely not designed for dancefloors.\u201d When I ask him to elaborate, he reels off a list that includes strange folk and percussion, Brazilian soap opera opening sequences and a particularly rhythmic recording of frogs. \u201cIt sounds like techno, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d he laughs. In the style of Detroit legends 3 Chairs and parties like The Loft, it\u2019s not rare to hear a track from start to finish, crackles and all, before moving on to the next. The long-championed approach feels increasingly rare in contemporary clubbing, which often favours big drops and quick blends. \u201cWhat if the tune has a beautiful intro? You could skip to the beat and mix it from there but you might miss the best bit,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s a different way of digesting the music.\u201d Having weathered the threat of redevelopment, Smith is optimistic. After a two-year fundraising campaign, MAP bought Hope House in 2019, ensuring a future for both the classrooms and the club. This month, the team are launching a new label offshoot, with an all-in house production line, from the recording to the dubplate cutting and sleeve printing. The inaugural releases will be by long-term friend and supporter Four Tet, including a cassette edition of his digital-only record 871 and, later this year, a limited edition run of his new album, complete with custom artwork by MAP students. \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity to share what we\u2019ve got with a lot of people,\u201d says Smith. It\u2019s a reminder of what grassroots clubbing can provide when the resources are there. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to keep these things going because they live off energy, and energy when there isn\u2019t that much income is always hard to maintain after a few years,\u201d says Peterson. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important that places like that keep getting the new energy \u2026 to keep the walls shiny and the lights bright.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-14", "section": "Music", "author": "Safi Bugel", "id": 417, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/28f0de490acde6a7a56408361f89b21e1f311ed6/0_462_1365_818/500.jpg"}, {"title": " David Harewood: teach young actors resilience to face industry\u2019s brutal side ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/feb/15/david-harewood-teach-young-actors-resilience-face-industrys-brutal-side-rada", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.096, "neu": 0.693, "pos": 0.211, "compound": 0.987}, "body": "David Harewood has called for acting graduates to be taught \u201cresilience\u201d to steel them for the industry\u2019s brutal side, as he prepares to take over as president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. The actor, who is to replace Kenneth Branagh in the role, has pledged to pass on what he learned after suffering with mental health issues as a young Rada graduate. He said: \u201cI had some problems when I left and I think it is incumbent upon myself and Rada to teach resilience and prepare students: give them financial skills \u2013 tax skills, for example \u2013 things that we were never prepared for.\u201d In the 2019 BBC documentary David Harewood: Psychosis and Me, the actor discussed his mental health struggles, which resulted in him being sectioned shortly after graduating. He was subjected to racist reviews and left with limited opportunities upon being pigeonholed as a \u201cblack actor\u201d. Harewood says it instilled in him a desire to pass on his knowledge as a very active and accessible president. \u201cRather than being a sort of standard bearer for the school in terms of a fundraiser, I really want to be there and as accessible to the students as possible,\u201d he said. The actor plans to use his connections in the industry to bring in stars who have found success, as well as actors who have found it hard, to share their experiences. \u201cI intend to bring some of my successful friends into the drama school, those who have had successful careers and those who have struggled,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to hear both sides of the coin.\u201d Cynthia Erivo will join Harewood, who is the first black president of Rada, as the inaugural vice-president at the school. Harewood, who has long advocated for more opportunities for black British actors in the UK industry after having to move to the US to get his big break, said his and Erivo\u2019s presence would send a strong message to students. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sticking plaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of a concerted agenda to take diversity and inclusion to a new level and change the direction \u2013 we\u2019ve had 120 years of Rada being one thing and it\u2019s been very successful, but the future will be a very different playground. We have to embrace that and be a beacon for inclusivity and diversity.\u201d Rada admitted it was \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d in 2021 after students complained about non-inclusive teaching, and the organisation apologised for its \u201cinadequate response\u201d to the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. Harewood said the school, which enacted an action plan after a review of its processes, was on the brink \u201cof a new era\u201d and had genuinely changed. \u201cHaving been through the training at a time when questions of race were handled in a non-inclusive way, being part of an agenda where that discussion is open and honest is a good thing,\u201d said Harewood. \u201cWe have to get on board with these things. It\u2019s exciting to be part of this new wave and this new generation who want to build a new vision of how things should be. 40% of Rada\u2019s intake on the BA acting course is either black or non-white, and I think it\u2019s important that we represent those young people.\u201d Branagh, who had a nine-year tenure at Rada, said: \u201cIt is a thrill to welcome the brilliant David Harewood and Cynthia Erivo to their new roles at the academy.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-15", "section": "Culture", "author": "Lanre Bakare", "id": 418, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0d528b4e094de8068bcc32933253cc474a8718fc/0_101_5104_3063/500.jpg"}, {"title": "How we met: \u2018I thought she was very serious and a bit boring\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/15/how-we-met-i-thought-she-was-very-serious-and-a-bit-boring", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.025, "neu": 0.687, "pos": 0.288, "compound": 0.9987}, "body": "Gillian fell in love with Africa after taking a sabbatical trip to Ethiopia in 2014, where she ran an agricultural NGO. After returning home to Toronto the following year, she realised she wanted to go back. \u201cI am really passionate about environmental issues and was drawn to Africa,\u201d she says. \u201cI work for a sustainability advice company and decided to transfer to their Kenya office.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2019 that she met Frances, who had moved from the Philippines to work for the same firm. \u201cI wanted an adventure and I was interested in developing markets,\u201d says Frances. \u201cWhen I arrived, I found out that Gillian was going to be my boss on a conservation project in east Africa.\u201d They met properly for the first time at a coffee shop, to catch up on the project and get to know each other. \u201cMy first impression was that she was very serious and a bit boring,\u201d admits Frances. Gillian thought Frances seemed smart but she didn\u2019t expect her to be around for long. \u201cMost people come for about a year. I figured I\u2019d work with her for a while and then never see her again.\u201d Their work involved lots of travel, which meant long drives and nights spent in different towns across the continent. \u201cOne day, we got stuck somewhere and I remember thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t want to have dinner with my boss!\u2019\u201d says Frances. \u201cBut we ended up talking about lots of interesting things. I told her a bit about my experiences of being from Chinese heritage \u2013 in Africa, people weren\u2019t used to seeing people who looked like me.\u201d On their drives, Gillian began telling Frances about the environmental impact of their work. \u201cShe was really passionate about the topic and would send me about five website links every day,\u201d she says. \u201cBut she did get me to question how I made decisions and I started making an effort to eat more vegetarian food.\u201d They also found that they have a goofy side. \u201cWe are both artistic, high-energy and a bit competitive,\u201d says Gillian. \u201cWe write parody songs and make animated videos about our lives. We also do tough maths and logic challenges and even did a 100-day drawing challenge together. I\u2019m always a bit salty when Frances bests me at anything, but also impressed.\u201d When lockdown hit in 2020, they couldn\u2019t meet up, but it wasn\u2019t long before Frances turned to her new friend for help. \u201cI had never lived alone before,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore Covid, I\u2019d had home help, so it was a huge learning curve for me.\u201d She would phone Gillian to ask her how to work the washing machine or switch on the oven. \u201cI discovered she\u2019d been living on takeaways and overnight oats before lockdown,\u201d Gillian says. \u201cIt quickly became a joke \u2013 my dad used to call Frances my daughter. She asked me for recipes and made all kinds of cooking gaffes, like nearly putting a metal fork in the microwave. But what impressed me was her humility and ability to learn quickly. In a few months, she was making multi-course meals and eventually she invited friends over for a dinner party.\u201d As well as their sense of humour, the pair also share a passion for art and drawing. \u201cShe\u2019s so talented,\u201d says Frances. \u201cWe also discovered that we\u2019re both Christian, so it\u2019s nice to have a friend with the same values who can give advice based on a shared ethos.\u201d Over the past few years, they have supported each other through relationship breakups and family issues, as well as the day-to-day stresses of work. Though Frances moved back to the Philippines in 2021, they still communicate via email and WhatsApp every day. \u201cFrances is a unique person,\u201d says Gillian. \u201cShe never says no to anything. I call her the sunshine of my life because she\u2019s just so bright. I had always found it hard to find real friends until I met her.\u201d Frances feels that Gillian has been a fantastic role model for her. \u201cShe\u2019s so smart and talented and has a lot of wisdom,\u201d she says. \u201cGillian always listens to people and is interested in getting to know them.

The French defence minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, said his country\u2019s defence spending will reach 2% of Gross Domestic Product this year. Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, underscored \u201c75 years of the transatlantic security partnership on the basis of mutual trust.\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said it is in the US interest to have a strong Nato. The alliance chief also said Nato is \u201con the right track\u201d when it comes to defence investment. France and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral agreement on security commitments tomorrow. Air alert warnings sounded across Ukraine overnight as Russia launched a massive missile attack on the country. A missile strike on the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border killed six people, a Russian official said. Ukraine is conducting a manoeuvre in Avdiivka to withdraw troops in some areas to \u201cmore advantageous positions\u201d, a military spokesman said. Asked about criticism from some American politicians, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, said: We are 31 democratic nations on both sides of the Atlantic. And as long as this alliance has existed, there have been different views and discussions. He added: When you look at the opinion polls, there is record high support for Nato. \u201cI\u2019m confident,\u201d Stoltenberg said, \u201cthat Nato will remain the strongest and most succesful alliance in history.\u201d He also said: I expect the United States to continue to be a staunch ally, for at least three reasons: First, it is in the national security interest of the United States to have a strong Nato. Second, there is actually broad bipartisan support for Nato in the United States. And thirdly, the criticism in the United States is not primarily against Nato, it\u2019s against Nato allies not spending enough money on Nato. And then actually we have a very good story to tell. Because for many years, it was a valid point and a fair case to raise from the US side that European allies and Canada did not spend enough. But things have really changed, with increased defence spending across Canada and Europe. Stoltenberg underscored that \u201cit is in the US interest to have a strong Nato because no other major power has anything like Nato \u2013 more than 30 friends and allies, and that makes the US stronger.\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said ministers discussed the \u201cdeteriorating security environment.\u201d \u201cWe can never take peace for granted,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we do not see an imminent military threat against the alliance.\u201d He added: Nato continues to ensure there\u2019s no room for miscalculation in Moscow about our readiness to protect all allies. Speaking to reporters after the Nato defence ministers\u2019 meeting, Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance\u2019s secretary-general, said \u201ctoday we accelerated work on resourcing our new defence plans and strengthening our transatlantic defence industrial base.\u201d \u201cThis requires investment, and we are on the right track,\u201d he stressed. In 2024, European Nato allies will invest a total of 380 billion dollars in defence, he said, noting that for the first time, this amounts to 2% of their total GDP. Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister, said he had a conversation with his Polish counterpart, Donald Tusk. The main topic is the situation at the border. We also talked about the increase in imports, especially grain, from the Russian federation and third countries to the EU. Ukraine and Poland should join forces to prevent Russian products from entering the European market. A missile strike on the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border on Thursday killed six people, including a child, and injured 18 others, a Russian official said. It was the latest in exchanges of long-range missile and rocket fire in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Hours earlier, Russia fired two dozen cruise and ballistic missiles at a broad area of Ukraine, hitting multiple regions after a midnight strike in Ukraine\u2019s northeast killed five people in an apartment building, authorities said. Five of the 18 people injured in Belgorod, a city of about 340,000 people, were children, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. Tass news agency reported that 15 people were hospitalized. In its latest defence intelligence update, the British defence ministry said that \u201con 14 February 2024, Ukrainian forces conducted a successful uncrewed surface vessel attack on the Russian Rophucha-class landing craft Tsezar Kunikov, which almost certainly resulted in the sinking of the vessel.\u201d It added that \u201cthree of ten Ropucha-class vessels have now been destroyed by Ukrainian strikes.\u201d Canada\u2019s defence minister, Bill Blair, has announced that his country has finalised procuring an air defence capability and is acquiring new counter-drone equipment for Canadian troops in Latvia. Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, has welcomed the new members of the European Sky Shield Initiative, which now has 21 members. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, which begins tomorrow Here\u2019s a \u201cfamily photo\u201d from today\u2019s Nato defence minister\u2019s meeting. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, said in a post on Telegram that 5 people were killed and 18 injured in a Ukrainian missile attack. Ukraine is conducting a manoeuvre in Avdiivka to withdraw troops in some areas to \u201cmore advantageous positions\u201d, military spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy said today, Reuters reported. He said that Ukraine had activated a backup logistics route into the town, but that supplies into Avdiivka and evacuations from it were \u201cdifficult\u201d. France and Ukraine will sign a bilateral agreement on security commitments tomorrow, the Elysee has announced, Reuters reported. The agreement was expected to be finalised in Ukraine, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had postponed his trip. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is set to visit France and Germany. After Donald Trump said he would not defend Nato members that don\u2019t meet defence spending targets, European governments are keen to showcase their contributions to the alliance\u2019s defences. This dynamic was on full display this morning. The German delegation to Nato posted on social media reiterating that Germany \u201cprovides significant forces postures\u201d to the alliance. The French defence minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, said his country\u2019s defence spending will reach 2% of Gross Domestic Product this year. The World Bank, the European Commission, and the United Nations have increased their estimates for the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine to $486 billion (\u20ac452.8 billion) over the next decade, up from $411 billion (\u20ac383 billion) estimated one year ago. In a joint statement they said: In 2024 alone, Ukrainian authorities estimate the country will need around $15 billion (\u20ac14 billion) for immediate reconstruction and recovery priorities at both the national and community level, with a particular focus on supporting and mobilising the private sector alongside restoration of housing, soft infrastructure and services, energy, and transport. The figures highlight the urgency of the EU\u2019s commitment to deliver \u20ac50bn in a new Ukraine facility to find schools, housing, pensions and health services at an emergency leaders meeting last month. Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, said: We see that the needs for reconstruction have continued to grow over the past year. The main resource for Ukraine\u2019s recovery should be the confiscation of Russian assets frozen in the West. We need to start this process already this year. Concurrently, the Ukrainian government is creating conditions to attract private investments, which will accelerate the reconstruction process and transform our country on its path to the EU. Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, underscored when arriving at the Nato defence ministers\u2019 meeting this morning the \u201c75 years of the transatlantic security partnership on the basis of mutual trust.\u201d Germany, he said, along with along with 17 other Nato allies, \u201cwill reach the agreed 2% target this year.\u201d He added: Our aim must be to be the backbone of conventional deterrence and defence in Europe with other partners. Grant Shapps, the British defence secretary, said that the UK will co-lead a major drone capability coalition with Latvia for Ukraine. I\u2019m proud to announce that the UK and Latvia will co-lead an international coalition to build Ukraine\u2019s vital drone capabilities. Together, we will give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to defend itself and win this war, to ensure that Putin fails in his illegal and barbaric ambitions. The head of the House intelligence committee, Mike Turner, has called for the Biden administration to declassify information on what he called a \u201cserious national security threat\u201d, which was later reported to involve Russian plans to deploy nuclear weapons in space. In his statement, Turner, an Ohio Republican, gave no details about the supposed security threat. Talking to reporters at the White House later on Wednesday, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, expressed surprise at Turner\u2019s statement saying he was due to meet the \u201cgang of eight\u201d (congressional leaders with special security clearance for classified briefings) on Thursday. But Sullivan did not give any details of the planned meeting. ABC News and the New York Times cited unnamed sources as saying that the security threat Turner was referring to involved Russia\u2019s potential deployment of a nuclear anti-satellite weapon in space. The New York Times said US allies had also been briefed on the intelligence, which was not deemed to represent an urgent threat, as the alleged Russian capability was still in development. Read the full story here. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has thanked Australia for contributing funds to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s defence capabilities. Arriving at today\u2019s meeting of defence ministers, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters that \u201csupporting Ukraine is not charity\u201d and that helping Kyiv \u201cis an investment in our own security.\u201d He said ministers will discuss their support to Ukraine and strengthening the alliance\u2019s deterrence and defence. He added: And to do both, we need to invest more, and we are on the right track. Because we now have historic numbers when it comes to defence investments. Last year, we saw an 11% real increase in defence spending across Europe and Canada. This year, we expect 18 Allies to meet the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. And European Allies together spend 280 billion US dollars on defence. And this is 2% of their combined GDP. But we still have a way to go. Because at our summit in Vilnius last year, all allies promised to spend 2% of GDP on defence, and 2% is a minimum. Addressing today\u2019s session with Ukraine\u2019s representatives, Stoltenberg said: We will address how to sustain our support to Ukraine. We see that our support is making a difference on the battlefield every day. Just yesterday, the Ukrainians were able to strike successfully a Russian naval ship, and this demonstrates the skills and the competence of Ukrainian armed forces, also in conducting deep strikes behind the Russian lines. He also stressed that Nato allies need to boost production of ammunition. To ensure that Ukraine gets the weapons, the supplies, the ammunitions they need, we need to ramp up production. And NATO allies have, just over the last months - since we agreed the defence investment plan - agreed and signed contracts for 10 billion euros, for more orders from different parts of the transatlantic defence industry. Air alert warnings sounded across Ukraine overnight as Russia launched a massive missile attack on the country. Ukrainian authorities reported the take-off of several Tu-95 strategic bombers in the early hours of Thursday morning, with explosions heard soon after. In Dnipro, a series loud explosions were audible shortly after 6am in the centre of the city. There were also reports of explosions in Zaporizhzhia, the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv. Andriy Sadoviy, the mayor of Lviv, said ten Russian missiles had been aimed at the Lviv region. In Zaporizhzhia, close to the front line with Russian forces, there were reports of a damaged apartment building. There was no information immediately available about casualties.

There is nothing \u201crightwing\u201d about that (Why have rightwingers made even parkrun a battleground for trans people?, 14 February). Any event that reports results separated into male and female categories, as parkrun does, is acknowledging that sex matters in sport. Many parkrunners value their achievements, which include overall placing by sex and age category, and age-graded score. But parkrun\u2019s policy is that male runners may register as female based on their \u201cidentity\u201d. As a result, some female course and age-grade records are held by male runners. The hyperbolic talk of requiring genital checks to change this is disingenuous. Parkrun does not carry out age or sex checks on anyone. All we want is that when parkrun asks people to register by sex and age, it indicates that \u201csex\u201d means sex at birth, as World Athletics and UK Athletics recommend. Runners who don\u2019t want to state their sex have two other options: \u201canother gender identity\u201d or \u201cprefer not to say\u201d. But rather than amending its registration policy, parkrun has hidden the problem by deleting the records of many men and women. Each week, there will still be males recorded as \u201cfirst female\u201d, bumping female runners down in their own category. It\u2019s less than two months since parkrun celebrated a new women\u2019s parkrun world record. It mattered then. Now parkrun is telling women who value their running achievements that the feelings of trans-identifying males matter more than theirs. Parkrun is fully inclusive \u2013 anyone can turn up and walk or run, for free. There is no need for it to be a vehicle for identities as well \u2013 and using it for this purpose is unfair to women, who care as much as men about success, recognition and excellence. Fiona McAnena Director of sport, Fair Play For Women \u2022 Jonathan Liew claims female parkrunners who want to compare run times with peers of the same age and sex are \u201cthe radical trans exclusionary police\u201d, \u201cuseful idiots on social media\u201d and part of \u201cthe rage machine\u201d, and that the issue \u201cisn\u2019t really about sport at all\u201d. This is all astonishing hyperbole. I am a leftwing feminist academic whose expertise is in women and sport, a Labour member, a director of the politically left Woman\u2019s Place UK, and a founder signatory of the Labour Women\u2019s Declaration. This denigration of female runners who campaign for their own grassroots sport categories as anti-trans and rightwing is offensive and reminiscent of historical battles for female-only sport over 100 years. Parkrun offers four categories: female, male, \u201cprefer not to say\u201d and \u201canother gender identity\u201d. Trans people should, of course, be included \u2013 trans men in female categories, if they so wish. But trans women, most of whom retain a 10% male performance advantage, can surely register in one of the other three categories. Because the hopes and dreams of female people matter. Many female runners want to know their run time compared with other females in their age group. Just like male runners. Course records in the one female category should celebrate the fastest female runners. How is that a rightwing outrage? The left leaves a wide-open goal for the right if it denies female runners even one female-only category. Cathy Devine Manchester \u2022 Thank you, Jonathan Liew, for your thoughtful piece. As a regular parkrunner, a cis woman and someone with a close family member who is a trans woman, I have a fair amount of skin in this game. I welcome running alongside trans women just as much as anyone else in my community. That is what community is \u2013 welcoming humanity in all its beautiful difference \u2013 and why parkrun is anathema to those who wish to police the boundaries of acceptability according to their narrow and reactionary definitions. I disagree with Policy Exchange rightwingers (and those helping to spread their prejudice), but they are welcome to run alongside me at parkrun. They might just get out of their echo chamber long enough to meet the human beings they are so keen to write off as nothing more than an ideology to be disparaged.

As the most high-profile Black actor of his era he felt he carried \u201cthe hopes and dreams of an entire people\u201d, but in 2024, when the TV landscape has nurtured the talents of Will Smith, Issa Rae, Tracee Ellis Ross and Quinta Brunson, Black talent\u2019s burden seems less terrific. Clearly musician/comedian/actor Vince Staples doesn\u2019t feel the pressure to be the respectable role model that Poitier felt he needed to be, judging by his self-titled sitcom \u2013 in which he really lets his freak flag fly. Staples\u2019s latest project embraces the weird, with this self-titled, surreal comedy \u2013 in which his protagonist navigates the dream-logic of a disquieting reality. He plays a fictionalised version of himself, a successful performer with a natural swagger whose world is filled with twisted, David Lynch-like humour. This Vince lives in a stylish mid-century modern home in a bizarre version of Long Beach, California, which is referred to only as \u201cthe Beach\u201d, and the episodes begin with a Fargo-esque disclaimer: \u201cThis is a work of fiction. Any similarities to actual events are purely coincidental.\u201d The first episode follows a brief stint in jail after a traffic violation where even the racist police officers can\u2019t help but think Staples is pretty darn cool. The rest follows our preternaturally chilled-out hero on an odyssey through small business loans, tense family cookouts, reunions with childhood rivals and, horror of horrors, trying to find a decent thing to eat at a theme park. While the set-ups are slight, the execution is delicious. Staples navigates bank heists and relationship quandaries with ludicrous suaveness. He casts himself as the perpetual straight man, nonplussed by the surreal goings-on around him, even resorting to deadpan wit mid-bank robbery (\u201cYou do a heist, you\u2019re George Clooney. You rob a bank, you\u2019re Queen Latifah\u201d). To add to the spirit of marching to the beat of his own drum, there are only five episodes, which range from 26 to just 18 minutes. Staples himself is an endlessly compelling presence, with a near-permanent furrowed brow, a baritone drawl and a lightness of touch in his delivery that means he never overexerts himself to land a punchline. The dialogue is sparse but pointed. We don\u2019t hear how exactly our eponymous figure knows the face-painted figure who is robbing the bank where he has just been refused a loan, but their easy rapport is so effortlessly established that we not only come to immediately understand the nature of their relationship, but also join Vince in wanting them to make off with the vault\u2019s contents in a speedy getaway. Staples has previously been best known as an affiliate of the California alt hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, which counted Frank Ocean and Tyler, the Creator among its members. But he has also appeared in the recent White Men Can\u2019t Jump remake, coming-of-age indie dramedy Dope and has a recurring role on the popular sitcom Abbott Elementary as Janine\u2019s love interest, Maurice. Given his career background and his show\u2019s phantasmagorical flights of whimsy, the logical comparison for this series would be with Donald Glover\u2019s Atlanta, which was launched after Glover\u2019s successful stint on Dan Harmon\u2019s cult college-set comedy Community and early success under his rapper pseudonym Childish Gambino. Even if the two highly funny, delightfully weird shows are ultimately different beasts, both afford plenty of joy in watching Black men afforded the creative freedom to present the twisted workings of their minds without self-censoring for the sake of mass appeal \u2013 even if that comes across as a little weird to some. The series touches upon some serious issues as well as the more surreal comic touches. It delves into mass incarceration, gun violence and a difficult relationship between Vince and his mother (Coming to America\u2019s Vanessa Bell Calloway) \u2013 who are perpetually having to post bail for one another. But these issues only arise as they serve Vince\u2019s story, rather than his journey being used as a tool to preach about struggles facing the entire African American community. The series is executive produced by Kenya Barris, whose previous show, black-ish, focused on a successful, loving Black family and reportedly had 79% non-Black viewership. But the show is Staples\u2019s unique vision. Unlike black-ish\u2019s willingness to perform Blackness for the uninitiated (explaining to its audience the biases around hair, colourism or why \u201cwe\u201d love Prince), The Vince Staples Show isn\u2019t interested in making it more palatable or comprehensible to placate the Netflix masses. The creative partnership between the pair seems to have brought out the best in both, making this a return to form for Barris and a wonderful showcase of Staples\u2019 talents. These Black artists joyously fill the screen with a vision unburdened by needing to be the representative of an entire community, and it\u2019s down to audiences to step into this world and buckle up for a weird and wonderful ride.

She keeps the emotional import of the words she sings absolutely front and centre of her delivery, without compromising the shape or sense of the music, and she has fabulous low notes as a bonus.

She has top-notch support from Erin Morley, who brings a crystalline soprano to Morgana, Alcina\u2019s flightier sister, Elizabeth DeShong\u2019s richly expressive Bradamante, and Anna Bonitatibus, whose dark, agile voice captures Ruggiero\u2019s impetuosity. Minkowski encourages them to decorate the repeats in their arias lavishly from the off, and all rise to the challenge.

Come on! This isn\u2019t just because all three shows have an actor-rapper in them, by the way. As with Dave, Staples plays a version of himself inflected by fame: people come up to him and recognise him, certain doors are opened and wheels are greased as a result of who he is, he is randomly adored or hated by passersby, and that\u2019s a really interesting and fun texture for a show to have. And, much like Atlanta, there\u2019s a woozy, anything-could-happen quality to what\u2019s going on (an episode set in an off-brand theme park is so Atlanta I did wonder whether they found a rejected script in a big bin behind the studios at FX). Right, I\u2019m glad we cleared that up. This is a good thing, though. A small part of me does rankle against the fact that, for some reason, the only TV writers allowed to create ambitious, meta, surreal TV shows with gorgeous direction have to prove themselves as bestselling music artists first. (If an ordinary \u201cwriter\u201d wrote the first episode of The Vince Staples Show, it would be mushed through a mill of producers who insist on \u201cstory beats\u201d and \u201cperhaps an extra character\u201d and \u201cI want to know more about the girlfriend\u201d: Vince Staples can just say \u201cbut I\u2019m Vince Staples\u201d and shut those conversations down.) The point is, these ambitious shows are actually being made, and they\u2019re being made in such a number and to such a high quality that they are becoming a genre of their own. Sure, for now, Vince Staples is one of the few people on Earth afforded the freedom to make something as lush and weird and meandering as The Vince Staples Show. But the template exists now, and one day someone will be able to make a show like this without having to spend a couple of years in Odd Future first. In the show, Staples plays a deadpan version of himself in a semi-surrealised version of Long Beach, California. (It is simply called the Beach; each episode opens with the words: \u201cThis is a work of fiction. Any similarities to actual events are purely coincidental.\u201d I personally quite like that rappers have reclaimed \u201cbeing a bit pretentious\u201d.) He is deliberately flat and normal while chaos and weirdness unfurls around him. It\u2019s a bit like when a successful Live at the Apollo comedian is given their own BBC Two sitcom, and they always write themselves as The World\u2019s Most Normal Man, and every barista they encounter (it\u2019s always a barista) is a rude maniac, and the only joke is them blinking fast a couple of times and saying \u201cOK\u201d while people contort weirdly next to them. The way Staples does it is far cooler, though, and the weirdness around him tempered adroitly \u2013 it never bulges out into full, unbelievable weird, just something bristling at the edges \u2013 and there is a knot at the centre of his character, a quiet discomfort with his level of fame and the presumption that he\u2019s just a musician, that makes this more interesting than \u201cman with no emotions has difficult interaction with a hospitality worker\u201d. This is not going to be a show for everyone \u2013 it\u2019s quite ambient, one episode is inexplicably only 18 minutes long (why even turn the camera on? Go and write more script!) and sometimes it does stray into a TV pet peeve of mine which is \u201cthings happening with no explanation and no further mention at all\u201d \u2013 but broadly I am just happy that there\u2019s a new, interesting, weird genre of television happening. If this is what rappers are doing then just cut out the middleman and give them all a development deal right now. I want to see what Ice Spice does when given access to a former Top Boy director, a writers\u2019 room full of Princeton graduates, a quarter-million dollar budget and carte blanche to do whatever the hell she feels like.

Sixteen women \u2013 including Guardian US columnist Naomi Klein, Observer art critic Laura Cumming and historian Tiya Miles \u2013 are now in the running for the \u00a330,000 prize, launched last year to redress the relatively low numbers of women recognised in nonfiction prizes. The \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d longlisted titles are \u201cabout redressing wrongs \u2013 so whether that\u2019s exposing truth, or revealing hypocrisy or uncovering hidden stories \u2013 there\u2019s a dedication to truth\u201d, said chair of judges and historian Suzannah Lipscomb. Klein was longlisted for Doppelganger, in which she writes about being mistaken for the feminist writer turned conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf. Prize judge and biographer Anne Sebba said that Doppelganger was \u201csuch a clever book\u201d because Klein \u201ctakes what, on the face of it, is a simple idea of having a double, someone who is frequently thought of as her, but then expands this to construct a dark comedy of a rather terrifying mirror image world\u201d. Miles made the longlist for All That She Carried, a story of slavery centred on a sack that an enslaved woman passes on to her daughter. The book \u201cfinds a way to give voice to the wordless by using a mundane, domestic object \u2013 a cloth sack and its contents \u2013 to thread an extraordinary tale through the generations\u201d, wrote Colin Grant in his Guardian review. The 16 titles will be narrowed down to a shortlist of six, to be announced on 27 March. The winner will be announced alongside the fiction prize on 13 June. Along with the cash prize, the winning author will receive an artwork, known as The Charlotte, created by sculptor Ann Christopher. Cumming was selected for Thunderclap, about the early deaths of Dutch painter Carel Fabritius and Cumming\u2019s father. \u201cI love this book because of the way she intertwines a subtle and tender love of her father with a deep understanding of Dutch art,\u201d said Sebba. Lipscomb noted that many, though not all of the longlisted books feature a \u201cpersonal voice\u201d, weaving academic research with personal reflections. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of owning one\u2019s subjectivity as an author that comes out of these, and I think that might be a zeitgeisty thing \u2013 it might be that if we\u2019d launched this prize 10 years ago, that wouldn\u2019t be the case. But that\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d Other memoiristic titles chosen include Safiya Sinclair\u2019s How to Say Babylon, about growing up Rastafari, and Intervals by Marianne Brooker, about her mother\u2019s illness and death. The launch of the nonfiction prize came in the wake of research commissioned by the Women\u2019s prize that found that only 35% of books awarded a nonfiction prize over the past 10 years were written by women, across seven UK nonfiction prizes. While the longlist was made up of \u201cbrilliant\u201d books across \u201ceconomics and technology and science and history and investigative journalism\u201d, said Lipscomb, \u201cthere were fewer books submitted in some of these areas than one might have hoped, and perhaps fewer books submitted in adjacent areas, like philosophy, literary criticism, geopolitics, mathematics, sports\u201d. Lipscomb hopes that the prize will encourage publishers to \u201cinvest in female writers writing in these fields\u201d. Also on the longlist are The Dictionary People by Sarah Ogilvie, The Britannias by Alice Albinia, Vulture Capitalism by Grace Blakeley, Eve by Cat Bohannon, Shadows at Noon by Joya Chatterji, Some People Need Killing by Patricia Evangelista, Wifedom by Anna Funder, Matrescence by Lucy Jones, Flat Place by Noreen Masud, Code Dependent by Madhumita Murgia and Young Queens by Leah Redmond Chang. This year\u2019s prize was open to books published in the UK between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. Alongside Lipscomb and Sebba on the judging panel are fair fashion campaigner Venetia La Manna, author Nicola Rollock, and winner of the 2018 Women\u2019s prize for fiction Kamila Shamsie.

Almost 800 people had entered the competition. Emily had come to the pub with her family and her wrists covered in friendship bracelets to hand out. She danced the hardest and sang the loudest to Taylor Swift covers played during the night by a local act. Emily didn\u2019t win but Molly Davis \u2013 who organised the event and was taken by Emily\u2019s enthusiasm for Swift \u2013 had a few other ideas to get her to the concert on Sunday 25 February. \u201cI was sitting with my friends and we\u2019re all big Swifties and we kept saying to each other that if we won it we would give it to [Emily] because she was such a dedicated fan and we all really wanted to see her go,\u201d Davis said.

And I do understand it. In Britain, we\u2019re almost all of us deficient in vitamin D during the colder months (many of us in summer, too). Low vitamin D has been linked to myriad health complaints, from mild to life-threatening. But while it sounds commonsensical, skipping sun protection to increase your vitamin D level is highly risky, and has had limited success and fallen flat under scrutiny so far. There are far safer ways to obtain vitamin D (from supplements or, better still, a balanced diet) than by subjecting skin cells to UVA radiation, which makes up about 95% of the UV rays that reach our skin, and doesn\u2019t even cause vitamin D synthesis. What UVA does do is destroy collagen; cause sun damage, uneven pigmentation and slackening; and play a role in some cancers. UVB, on the other hand, does help produce vitamin D, but it also burns skin, causes cancers and makes up only 5% of our exposure anyway. To chase UV rays in order to top up vitamin D levels is as sensible as swigging gin to obtain vital fluids. I see how easy it is to look at a dull, grey day and assume the sun could do no possible harm. But UVA is present in all daylight (even when you\u2019re sitting in a room or car next to a window) and if we find the right SPF product for our lifestyles, skin types and effort levels, there\u2019s no logical reason not to wear one daily. It\u2019s for this reason that I advocate the use of facial moisturisers containing SPF. As long as they\u2019re applied in sufficient quantities (squeezed along the full length of your index and middle fingers to apply to the face and neck), they\u2019ll protect and reduce faff on busy winter mornings. My favourite ever is Medik8\u2019s Advanced Day Ultimate Protect (\u00a359), which is suitable for all skin types, behaves beautifully under makeup and doesn\u2019t sting my eyes, but it does cost a fortune. L\u2019Oreal\u2019s brand new Bright Reveal Dark Spot Hydrating Cream SPF50 (\u00a329.99) is a pleasure to use and should not be the sole reserve of those with pigmentation problems, since its active pigment-tackling ingredient is niacinamide, from which all of us benefit anyway.

At its best \u2013 and these days it is a ruinously expensive pastime \u2013 it\u2019s a simply thrilling experience that reminds you why wine is such an incredibly special drink. Ethereal, creamy and with a crisp acidity that makes it a perfect partner for seafood, white burgundy is an absolute joy. And, after a run of tricky vintages, the 2022 is not only good, but plentiful \u2013 though sadly that doesn\u2019t mean prices have gone down; rather that they just haven\u2019t gone up much higher. The 22s are already in the shops, and most of the affordable ones come from the M\u00e2connais, the region to the south, though bar a few exceptions I don\u2019t find them as exciting, and too much like chardonnay you can find cheaper elsewhere. That said, the 22s are more in balance, with a fresh acidity that counterbalances the richness. (If you share my view, look for wines of 13% ABV or under that don\u2019t have the word \u201cchardonnay\u201d on the label, because that often flags up a more international style.) Chablis from the northern end of the region is particularly delicious this year, but it has got expensive. It\u2019s still not like chardonnay from anywhere else, though. Petit chablis, which you might assume meant lesser quality, simply refers to wines made from vines grown outside the officially recognised Chablis region, and it, too, can be excellent, as proven by the Domaine Dampt wine in today\u2019s pick. It\u2019s also worth looking out for less well-known appellations that don\u2019t carry the same price tag as the more famous ones: Auxey-Duresses and Pernand-Vergelesses, for example. Aligot\u00e9, Burgundy\u2019s other white wine grape, is also a more affordable option, and many good producers are making it now. If you want one of the better growers, however, the best buy is a basic bourgogne blanc, though even that can be pricey. I swooned over Dominique Lafon\u2019s, which are available from Berry Bros &amp; Rudd (in the unlikely event they have any left). You will most likely have to buy them en primeur, which means you pay for the wine upfront minus tax and duty, which are payable on delivery in about a year\u2019s time. Wine merchants\u2019 generic white burgundy tends to be more affordable, with the added advantage that the 22s are available right now: Adnams and Tanner\u2019s are two I\u2019d recommend. Finally, you\u2019ll be far better off drinking your white burgundy at home, rather than in a restaurant (unless you\u2019re doing BYO), because restaurant mark-ups on the stuff tend to be more than a little cheeky. Five (just about) affordable white burgundies Domaine Dampt Petit Chablis Vieilles Vignes 2022 \u00a319.99 (or \u00a314.99 by the mixed case) Laithwaites, 12.5%. Disregard the \u2018petit\u2019: this has all the quality of a good chablis. Booth\u2019s White Burgundy Chardonnay 2022 \u00a313.25, 13%. Exemplary basic white burgundy, and arguably the best-value wine in this lineup. The same store\u2019s 12.5% chablis at \u00a315 is terrific, too. The Wine Society\u2019s Generation Series M\u00e2con-Villages \u00a316.50, 13%. One of the highlights of the first tranche of a new range that celebrates the Society\u2019s 150th anniversary. Fresher, crisper and more elegant than many m\u00e2cons. Classy. Bourgogne Aligot\u00e9 Comte Armand 2022 \u00a3111 by the six-bottle case (in bond) Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 12.5%. If you like chablis you\u2019ll love pure, pristine aligot\u00e9. Especially with oysters or sashimi. Limited supplies, though. Drouhin Vaudon Chablis 2022 \u00a327.50 (or \u00a324.75 for a mixed case of 12) Great Wine Co, 12.5%. Surprisingly intense for such a young wine, delicately creamy and elegant.

The Iranian government has prevented the film\u2019s two directors, Maryam Moghaddam and Behtash Sanaeeha, from travelling to Berlin to attend their own premiere; six months ago, their production offices were raided and computers and hard drives confiscated. But, fortunately, the police couldn\u2019t find the film itself, whose gentle humanity is a compelling rebuke to this fatuous, clumsy repression. If I had to guess, I would say that the authorities had got wind of a particular scene in which the morality police drive self-importantly around a Tehran park in their van, intimidating young women who are allegedly not wearing their hijabs with enough modesty. The 70-year-old heroine \u2013 who wistfully remembers a time when hijabs were not required at all \u2013 stands up to these uniformed bullies and rescues a woman from their clutches. This is Mahin (a lovely performance from Lili Farhadpour), whose story is a meditation on love and loss, loneliness and old age, and on the price at which long-term married happiness is bought. It is a meditation on how women come to terms with the destiny of widowhood, of knowing that they will almost certainly outlive their husbands. Mahin is herself a widow whose daughter and grandchildren live abroad, and her muted existence alone in her apartment is revealed in a series of tremendously composed tableaux. There are FaceTime phone calls with her daughter which somehow never allow for a proper talk. She has difficulty getting to sleep and doesn\u2019t get up before noon. She waters the plants in her garden, goes shopping and occasionally hosts lunches for her female friends, at which the dominant theme is everyone\u2019s various ailments, discussed at hilarious and explicit length. But the conversation turns to whether it is possible to find romance again at their age. Why not? And so Mahin, without quite admitting it to herself, expands and modifies her aimless daytime schedule with a secret end in view: to meet a man. Mahin hangs out in the bakery queue, at the park, at a fancy hotel coffee shop and finally at a modest restaurant where pensioners\u2019 food vouchers can be redeemed. And she finds herself meeting cute with Faramarz (Esmaeel Mehrabi), a modest, personable single man of her age. He is a cab driver and military veteran, who himself is of Mahin\u2019s independent cast of mind: he got into trouble with joyless authorities for playing a musical instrument in a wedding band. And so Faramarz and Mahin have their moment together at her apartment, where she offers to bake him her favourite cake. It is a moment of emotional connection for which they have saved up all their thoughts and feelings since becoming single \u2013 as if the entirety of their late-life inner existences are now being poured out to each other. There is something quietly magnificent in it. Moments like these in life are poignantly brief \u2013 but many never have them at all.

The UK lender \u2013 which is still 35% government-owned \u2013 said pre-tax profits rose 20% to \u00a36.2bn in the year to December. That is higher than analyst forecasts for \u00a36bn, and marks its largest annual profit recorded since it made \u00a310bn in 2007, the year before excesses led to a \u00a345.5bn public rescue that has yet to be fully unwound 16 years later. Bumper profits in 2023 came as the bank made more money from loans and mortgages, compared with what it paid to savers, after another year of interest rate increases by the Bank of England. Those earnings, known as net interest income, rose 12% to \u00a311bn. It sent NatWest shares up more than 5%, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. The bank\u2019s bonus pool for bankers fell 3% to \u00a3356m despite the jump in profits. NatWest said this reflected the impact on shareholders, after the bank missed previous earnings guidance. Shareholders will receive a \u00a31bn payout, with a final dividend worth 11.5p a share, and have a chance to take part in a \u00a3300m share buyback programme. The earnings results will set a high benchmark for Thwaite, who NatWest confirmed on Friday would take over permanently as chief executive with immediate effect, running the bank alongside the incoming chair, Rick Haythornthwaite. Thwaite was paid \u00a31.7m pay package for the year, including a \u00a3245,000 cash bonus, and other benefits such as \u00a321,000 for business travel and \u00a31,700 for home security. Thwaite, who previously ran NatWest\u2019s business banking division, took over as the interim chief executive in July after his predecessor, Alison Rose, was forced to quit over a debanking row with Nigel Farage. Thwaite\u2019s appointment will help pave the way for government plans to sell shares in NatWest to the general public later this year, after the state agency that manages the taxpayer stake said the market needed reassurance on NatWest\u2019s leadership before going ahead. The debanking controversy started when Coutts \u2013 the NatWest-owned private bank for the ultra-wealthy \u2013 planned to shut Farage\u2019s bank accounts, and snowballed after Farage obtained internal documents that showed the bank had concerns over his political views. The scandal escalated when it emerged that Rose had discussed Farage\u2019s case with a BBC journalist. Rose was forced to forgo \u00a37.6m in pay from NatWest, although independent lawyers hired by the bank concluded she had made an \u201can honest mistake\u201d in speaking with the BBC and that concerns over Farage\u2019s political views were not the driving factor in the decision to shut his accounts. While the jump in earnings will be a relief after a tumultuous year, there are signs that profit growth could slow. NatWest warned that total income was expected to drop to \u00a313bn-\u00a313.5bn in 2024, from \u00a314.8bn this year, adding: \u201cThe economic outlook remains uncertain.\u201d The bank\u2019s forecasts point to a drop in inflation to 2.5% by the end of 2024 \u2013 from 4% now \u2013 leading to a cut in interest rates to 4% from current levels of 5.25%, which could put pressure on net interest income. Thwaite said the encouraging news on inflation was also being offset by other factors, including the government\u2019s removal of energy bill support and the fact that millions of homeowners were still set to roll off fixed mortgage terms on to higher rates. That bank had seen customers try to \u201ctake more control of their spending\u201d and were supplementing their income, including through cashback sites and secondhand shops online. However, Thwaite said the bank was going into 2024 \u201cfocused on the things we can control; delivering profitable growth, becoming more efficient, more productive, and simpler to deal with, while managing our cost and capital efficiently. Together, these actions will drive long-term, sustainable value for our customers, shareholders, and the wider UK economy.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-16", "section": "Business", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff Banking correspondent", "id": 430, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e19e2ec3a5a8c0189f511f2f887de1e0d640dd92/114_468_4311_2587/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Bowlification, from Britain to Boston and beyond | Letters", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/feb/16/bowlification-from-britain-to-boston-and-beyond", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.093, "neu": 0.691, "pos": 0.216, "compound": 0.9971}, "body": "Too bad that Emma Beddington used her one-stop eating experience to denounce eating food by the bowl or, as it\u2019s called here, \u201cbowlification\u201d (Food should be tasty, and it doesn\u2019t have to come in a bowl. Could someone tell my lovely American hosts?, 12 February). I grew up eating food by the bowl. Memories abound of my eight-year-old self eating breakfast congee mixed with salted duck egg, minced pickled cabbage, and freshly chopped aromatic herbs, or swallowing down gentle, slightly salted and ginger-flavoured congee when I was sick. Or as a young college student out and about with my mates enjoying our late-night bowls of hearty curry, pho, or slurpy ramen topped with slow-cooked pork belly and tempura eggplant and prawns. More importantly to us, the food was affordable, delicious and filling. As an American, I realise that I don\u2019t have the highly refined taste of the British palate to judge from. I have no gastronomical training except learning how to cook by my parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 elbow. I doubt if I\u2019ve eaten at a Michelin-star restaurant or can afford to. One thing I can afford is a good bowl of great food. Whether enjoying a shimmering wine-reduced beef stew on cold nights or slaying my way through bowls of udon, congee, ramen, pho, peanut stew or poke with family and friends, I can say with some experience that food by the bowl is a treasure to savour. That for generations, billions of people around the world seemed to love \u201cbowlification\u201d is palate proof that we can\u2019t be all wrong. NC Doyle Seattle, Washington, US \u2022 What a superb commentary by Emma Beddington on the latest bowl food phenomenon. I especially loved the last line about leaving full, but also empty. This Gwyneth Paltrow, Marie Kondo, Gillian McKeith obsession with \u201ccultifying\u201d every aspect of our lives is so joyless and devoid of pleasure, I wonder why anyone follows it at all. As my dear other half says: \u201cI don\u2019t want a bloody lecture, I just want me dinner!\u201d I won\u2019t even tell you how he describes Michelin joints and tasting menus. Suffice it to say, he\u2019s banned us from going to a couple up here in Yorkshire. Lizzie Rymer Huddersfield, West Yorkshire \u2022 Criticism of American bowls of nourishing but soulless food ignites a fire in my belly. The vast majority of Americans cannot afford the luxury of such complete nutrition. Indeed, our counterparts across the Atlantic seem to thrill at mockery of the fast food that has somehow become too luxurious for many here. To frown on undoubtedly expensive, nutritious food is a very \u201clet them eat cake\u201d sentiment. I am confident that the article wasn\u2019t meant to be punching down. Maybe if the critical fun was levelled at a specific genre of food in the title instead of \u201cAmericans\u201d, it would strike a better chord. Jesse Shepherd Etowah, North Carolina, US \u2022 The Boston food circle that Emma Beddington describes with such contempt has no bearing on the culinary delights of the Boston that I know and love. Countless wonderful restaurants would happily welcome you to try the tasty local fish, delight your palate with fresh oysters in abundance and serve you the best cod in beer batter ever tasted. My advice is don\u2019t dine with frat boys, and if you must eat from a bowl, might I suggest you try clam chowder? Sandra Hall Chesterfield, Derbyshire \u2022 I have lived in the US for a long time although I still have a British passport. I read Emma Beddington\u2019s rather sarcastic review of her food experience with a mixture of amusement and puzzlement. She seems to confuse a new-age fast-food experience with typical American cuisine, which is a bit like saying that because a chippie served its fried fish and chips in a newspaper, all British food is served that way. I know when I get food from a place like the one she mentioned that I am trading speed and convenience for ambience and pleasant dining. When I go to restaurants with linens, cutlery and plates, I typically experience the ambience and the pleasant experience she missed. Robert L Moore Atlanta, Georgia, US \u2022 I\u2019m Californian, but have lived in the UK for nearly 20 years. I always find it baffling when British folks go to one US city and then characterise it to apply to the entire US. It seems the same as an American eating haggis in Edinburgh and then suggesting that all British people eat it regularly. I was just visiting the US midwest last week \u2013 there was hardly a veggie in sight, let alone entire bowls of it.

Commodores \u2013 Let\u2019s Do It Right (1975) Bizarre as it now seems, the most obvious influence on Richie\u2019s early songs for Commodores was Sly Stone. You can hear the inspiration from the Family Stone in 1974\u2019s There\u2019s a Song in My Heart, while the next year\u2019s charming Let\u2019s Do It Right carries a hint of Everybody Is a Star in its DNA. 19. Love Will Conquer All (1986) Another huge hit, Dancing on the Ceiling from 1986 was nevertheless a less assured album than its predecessor. The title track is no All Night Long and Ballerina Girl is the point where Richie finally gets too MOR to defend. But the album has its moments, including Love Will Conquer All\u2019s supremely assured, super-slick pop-R&amp;B. 18. Up All Night (2006) Richie\u2019s later albums are a decidedly mixed bag \u2013 be warned you have to put in the hours while hunting for the gold. But Up All Night, from 2006\u2019s Coming Home, is great, eschewing Richie\u2019s quiet storm comfort zone for stammering, up-tempo 00s R&amp;B, through which his voice glides with impressive ease. 17. Commodores \u2013 Too Hot ta Trot (1977) Unlike many of their peers, Commodores didn\u2019t plunge into disco. Too Hot ta Trot turned up on the soundtrack to the disco movie Thank God It\u2019s Friday, but it applies their own method of getting bodies moving. There is a distinct whiff of Stone\u2019s Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) in the mix. 16. Say You, Say Me (1985) Richie was commissioned to write a theme for White Nights on the condition it shared the movie\u2019s title. Instead, he submitted Say You, Say Me, a smart move that uncoupled the song from the film in the public imagination. For something apparently recorded in his living room, it\u2019s impressively epic, complete with a dramatic tempo change. 15. Commodores \u2013 Sail On (1979) The intro to Sail On suggests a band trying a bit too hard to replicate the success of Three Times a Lady, but the song is better than that. It has a gorgeous, sighing melody with \u2013 for the first, but not the last, time in Richie\u2019s oeuvre \u2013 the noticeable influence of country amid the strings, horns and pattering congas. 14. Can\u2019t Slow Down (1983) Running With the Night was the hit, but Can\u2019t Slow Down\u2019s best up-tempo offering was the title track\u2019s jittery electronic funk. It was influenced by Michael Jackson\u2019s Wanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019, but is noticeably more unruffled in its vocal delivery, projecting Richie as a man who never breaks a sweat, even at his most urgent. 13. Commodores \u2013 Free (1975) In Commodores, Richie mostly wrote and sang the slow numbers, leaving the funk material to the drummer, Walter Orange. Mostly, but not always: 1975\u2019s Movin\u2019 On opens with two horn-powered Richie co-writes, of which Free, with its rock-influenced chorus, is the pick. 12. Deep River Woman (1986) If the 10m-selling Can\u2019t Slow Down was Richie\u2019s answer to Thriller, its follow-up, Dancing on the Ceiling, was Richie\u2019s take on Bad, designed to emulate Jackson\u2019s genre-busting success. But Richie went about it differently, as shown by Deep River Woman, which eschews courting a rock audience in favour of collaborating with the country institution Alabama. 11. Commodores \u2013 Sweet Love (1975) Sweet Love was Richie\u2019s first hit ballad \u2013 No 5 in the US Billboard chart \u2013 but it was a noticeably different kind of ballad from the super-slick songs that ultimately made him a superstar. Orchestrated, but driven by electric guitar, its gospel-influenced style is noticeably \u2013 and appealingly \u2013 tougher and rougher round the edges. 10. Hello (1983) Try to detach Hello (released as a single in 1984, a few months after it debuted on Can\u2019t Slow Down) from its video, with Richie\u2019s hammy acting, its questionable plotline \u2013 is it 100% ethical for a teacher to be romantically pursuing a blind student? \u2013 and, indeed, its inadvertently hilarious grand reveal. A tough call, for sure, but stick with it: a nailed-on ballad lurks behind it. 9. Commodores \u2013 Fancy Dancer (1976) If you want an impressive co-sign, Fancy Dancer was subsequently covered (but never officially released) by Prince. You can see why he might have been drawn to it: written by Richie and the bassist Ronald LaPread, it\u2019s less celebrated than Brick House, but just as funky, in a low-slung way. 8. Stuck on You (1984) His 2012 album with the Nashville superstars Tuskegee made Richie\u2019s affinity with country music explicit, although it had been an undercurrent in his music for years. You don\u2019t have to squint hard to picture Stuck on You as a straight country ballad; indeed, the Tuskegee version (with Darius Rucker) simply adds pedal steel to the arrangement. 7. Commodores \u2013 Zoom (1977) Overshadowed by the presence of Easy and Brick House on the same, eponymous album, Zoom is nevertheless fantastic: a product of a time when Richie\u2019s ballads were still rooted in soul music. It features a muted but powerful orchestral arrangement, with a hint of syncopation about the rhythm track and blissful harmonies. 6. Endless Love (1981) The duet version, with Diana Ross, was a huge hit, but head instead to Richie\u2019s original demo \u2013 appended to the reissue of his 1982 eponymous debut solo album \u2013 which strips the song of its blockbusting movie-theme qualities, revealing something more intimate, tender and affecting at its centre. 5. Commodores \u2013 Lady (You Bring Me Up) (1981) Richie\u2019s last big hit with Commodores was released almost simultaneously with Endless Love, the single that marked the start of his solo career. They couldn\u2019t be more different: Lady is sophisticated, string-laden, post-disco boogie, fabulous enough to make you wish Richie had incorporated at least a hint of this style in his solo career. 4. Commodores \u2013 Brick House (1977) Perhaps Brick House shouldn\u2019t be on this list \u2013 Richie neither sang nor wrote Commodores\u2019 most celebrated funk hit \u2013 but let\u2019s bend the rules, because a) he made a pretty good fist of performing it solo on his 2007 live album and b) Commodores\u2019 version is amazing: a lascivious order to dance. 3. Commodores \u2013 Three Times a Lady (1978) That Commodores\u2019 first No 1 was a waltz, which Richie initially intended to submit to Frank Sinatra, tells you a lot about how far from their roots the band had travelled, but no matter: millions of singles were shifted and Richie\u2019s future direction was mapped out. 2. All Night Long (All Night) (1983) The biggest-selling and best single from Can\u2019t Slow Down was a rare diversion from the lovestruck end-of-the-night slow dance soundtracks that were its primary currency. You would struggle to describe it as funk or soul music, but there is something irresistible about its combination of mood-setting, dusk-falling atmosphere and monster chorus. 1. Commodores \u2013 Easy (1977) There are diehard R&amp;B fans who will tell you that Richie was the ruination of Commodores, his pop leanings and focus on ballads gradually dragging a tough funk band irrevocably towards the middle of the road. Their gradual shift in focus \u2013 and Richie\u2019s role in it \u2013 is inarguable, but when his melodic powers were at full force, it scarcely mattered. Easy is a fantastic song, smooth local-radio staple or not. It\u2019s beautifully written, the melody and the loping rhythm perfectly capturing the lyric\u2019s peculiar emotional cocktail \u2013 blithe indifference with a twist of guilt and regret.", "date": "2024-02-16", "section": "Music", "author": "Alexis Petridis", "id": 432, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4bd5c54c626a1a2cd34e0205b41cb8a688f1dd42/469_692_3209_1925/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Taylor Swift: The Eras tour Melbourne show review \u2013 eye-popping spectacle from a generous performer", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/17/taylor-swift-concert-review-melbourne-night-1-eras-tour-australia", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.036, "neu": 0.647, "pos": 0.317, "compound": 0.9991}, "body": "When Taylor Swift first played in Melbourne 15 years ago, it was to an audience of 900. This week in the city, the US megastar performs for a quarter of a million. Love her or hate her, there\u2019s no denying it: Australia is in the thick of Swiftmania. Leading up to the hotly anticipated Australian leg of Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, Melbourne was lit up with it all, from a Swift-themed academic symposium to a pop-up merchandise stand at Crown, to a projection on Flinders Street Station welcoming Swifties to town \u2013 with the clock striking 13, naturally. It feels historic. What other musician has inspired this level of fanaticism since, dare I say it, the Beatles? We\u2019re talking seismic impacts from cheering at her shows, and the growing practice of Taylor-gating, in which ticketless fans gather outside the stadium to listen in and sing along together. The Eras Tour \u2013 the highest-grossing concert tour of all time (of all time!) \u2013 has been a fascinating beast to watch from afar. Moving through the stages of Swift\u2019s chameleonic career, it\u2019s smartly designed for maximum engagement. Each night Swift plays an essentially identical setlist bar two \u201csurprise songs\u201d. A concert film was released in October, so most fans know exactly what to expect (and have learned all the dances and chants from TikTok). The excitement is palpable and the atmosphere electric at the MCG on the first of her seven Australian shows. With 96,000 fans in attendance, it\u2019s the biggest show of the tour \u2013 and her career \u2013 yet. Thousands of strangers become instant friends inside and outside the show. Young women swap handmade friendship bracelets and compliment each other\u2019s outfits, often elaborate and handmade. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who feels my inner child healing \u2013 to paraphrase Swift herself, it gives me back my girlhood. The show itself is an eye-popping spectacle and completely engrossing \u2013 it clocks in at an impressive three and a half hours, but flies by. The singer dips into each of her albums \u2013 other than 2006\u2019s self-titled album (justice for Debut!) \u2013 which are represented by distinctive outfits and personalities: the dreamy hues of Lover, the gold of Fearless, the earthy, bucolic Folklore and Evermore, the gritty edge of Reputation, the princess gowns of Speak Now, the passion of Red, the metropolitan cool of 1989, the glitz and glam of Midnights. Each fan receives a wristband, which flashes in colours to match the era. Moving platforms, stairs and intricate sets \u2013 a forest seance for Evermore, a log cabin for Folklore \u2013 and a slick team of tightly choreographed dancers (including internet sensation Kameron Saunders, on fire as always) ensure there is always something to marvel at. Pyrotechnics, enormous smoke machines and fireworks \u2013 par for the course at this stage. Swift is a generous, genuine performer. Much of her audience banter is scripted, but there\u2019s nothing fake about the tears she sheds as she surveys the enormous crowd after Champagne Problems. Her stamina is incredible and her voice in fine form, but never better than on the evening\u2019s two highlights, the 10-minute version of All Too Well and the live debut of You\u2019re Losing Me on piano \u2013 breakup songs so vivid and emotional that screaming along with her and tens of thousands of others, I almost forgot I\u2019m in a happy relationship. It\u2019s pure joy. So much of the Eras Tour is fan service, from the inclusion of fan anthem Long Live (added later in the tour) to Easter eggs and iconic Swift moments, such as the Fearless spin. In the sweetest moment of each night, a fan \u2013 usually a child \u2013 is handed a hat off Swift\u2019s head during her performance of 22. This is a fan base who can spot even the slightest difference in a performance \u2013 a single note change in The 1 draws rapturous cheers, and a spirited shout in the chorus of The Last Great American Dynasty feels like it\u2019s just for us. The Eras Tour is, Swift says, for new fans and those who have been there since the very beginning. Judging by the number of millennial mothers and their young daughters, it\u2019s become intergenerational. The feeling really is one of inclusion and love \u2013 the show somehow feels simultaneously massive and like the most intimate thing in the world. On the crowded walk back into the city after the show, a busker sings You Belong With Me and we all sing along. Swift\u2019s refrain from All Too Well echoes in my head: I was there, I was there.

Whether you\u2019re a thrill-seeking adventurer, ravenous foodie or history buff, Australia\u2019s island state is the perfect place to embrace an experience you\u2019ve never had before. And if your ideal trip involves simply resting and reconnecting with nature, Tasmania\u2019s bespoke accommodation hosts are ready to show you what their beloved home state \u2013 and its abundance of natural wonders \u2013 has to offer. A restorative stay for every guest Instagram: @Tasmanian_shacklife Naomi Hume is the creator of the accommodation listings site Tasmanian Shacklife, a sensory delight that introduces visitors to some of the island\u2019s best stays \u2013 from the rugged west coast to the picturesque east and everywhere in between. As a local, Hume has a simple wish: to give every visitor to Tasmania the best possible experience. \u201cAll of my shack stays are immersive enough for people to go, \u2018I just want to picture myself here\u2019,\u201d she says. Naomi Hume, creator of Tasmanian Shacklife \u201cNinety per cent were the host\u2019s own home or shack that they\u2019ve turned into a space they share with others. It isn\u2019t just a typical Airbnb \u2013 it offers something else. It might be timber, washed-up driftwood, beautiful cups of tea, and Tasmanian gins and whiskies. But then there\u2019s also fishing rods and a jetty at the doorstep.\u201d That\u2019s exactly the website\u2019s vibe. Visitors will find choices ranging from a restored sandstone cottage to a tin shed in the mountains to a converted fishing hut by the wild sea. Each one offers a unique perspective on Tasmania\u2019s diverse landscapes, wildlife and experiences. \u201cI think the term shacklife is quite Tasmanian,\u201d Hume says. \u201cEverywhere is what you make it, but you can really make it in Tassie. If you put your feet on the ground here, you\u2019ll see it for yourself.\u201d If this sounds like the lush, rejuvenating holiday you\u2019re after, here are some of the island\u2019s best spots to make it happen. Sheepwash Bay Bruny Island Photograph: @milesunchartered and @sheepwashbay Jenene Oates and her partner, John Bullock, were already living off-grid on Bruny Island before they decided to host visitors. \u201cChoosing to share the space with others has forced us to distill and concentrate the essence [of the place], and present it in a user-friendly way,\u201d Oates says. \u201cThis has, in turn, led us to appreciate living simply in nature.\u201d Their property at Sheepwash Bay offers guests two ways to enjoy this wild coastline: The Hide, a private, luxurious tiny house, and The Shack, a cabin built from reclaimed timbers, with French doors that open to breathtaking views. \u201cWe decided we\u2019d really like to do something that encourages people to dip their toe into a natural experience from a place of comfort,\u201d Oates says. \u201cThe Hide is very close to the water. Sitting down there, watching seagulls and wedgetails and dolphins, you can actually have \u2026 we call it \u2018the David Attenborough moments\u2019.\u201d Bullock, AKA the Bruny Baker, is also behind the local attraction the Bread Fridge, which he keeps freshly stocked with wood-fired loaves to top off the perfect visit. White Cottage North Hobart If you\u2019re a more cosmopolitan visitor, White Cottage is a slice of serenity in the heart of Hobart, within easy reach of some of Tasmania\u2019s most iconic arts, entertainment and food experiences. This 1900s Federation cottage is packed with historical features, including ornate fireplaces, oak floors built from local timber, and a heritage-listed chimney, while also offering a modern kitchen and luxurious deep bath. White Cottage feels like a secluded escape from the daily routine, but it\u2019s only a 15-minute walk from Hobart\u2019s city centre, making it the ideal jumping-off point for visiting Mona, hitting the bustling North Hobart restaurant strip, or heading into the markets at Salamanca. Instagram: @white_cottage_hobart The Eco Cabin Deloraine Stunning Deloraine is known for its crafts, and hosts Tasmania\u2019s annual craft fair every November. It\u2019s here, close to the Meander River, that you\u2019ll also find The Eco Cabin. Scandi-inspired, this luxury accommodation can be found on one of Deloraine\u2019s oldest properties, complete with heritage hawthorn brambles, century-old dry stone walls, and uninterrupted views to Quamby Bluff and the Great Western Tiers. But this new A-frame cabin is also packed with modern comforts, from keyless smart-lock entry to programmable electric blankets \u2013 all with the latest eco technology. Spend your nights relaxing under the stars in the outdoor mineral hot tub, or retire in front of the fire with a book from the cabin\u2019s hidden library. Instagram: @ecocabintasmania Aplite House Friendly Beaches Instagram: @aplite_house After each guest ends their stay at Aplite House, Sam and Tamzen Brewster race to see what\u2019s been written in their guest book. This modern sanctuary sits amid 80 hectares of Tasmanian forest, along the Great Eastern Drive, between Coles Bay and Bicheno. It\u2019s fringed on three sides by Freycinet National Park, and is close to beaches; it\u2019s easy to see why visitors are drawn to this idyllic location. \u201cIt\u2019s immersed in Tasmania\u2019s east coast wilderness,\u201d Sam says. He says designing and creating the house was fascinating and enjoyable, involving plenty of thought, research and planning alongside physical work \u201cand heaps of fun\u201d. Now, he and Tamzen welcome guests to enjoy their completely solar-powered, self-catered escape \u2013 which they might find themselves sharing with a Tassie devil, wombat or quoll. \u201cWe love running Aplite as eco accommodation,\u201d Sam says. \u201cSharing such a restorative and regenerative space is extremely rewarding and enriching for us, especially through the feedback guests provide about how rejuvenated they feel.\u201d In typical Tasmanian fashion, creating a space that connects people with nature has also strengthened Sam and Tamzen\u2019s ties to the world. \u201cIt\u2019s opened up our global view while at the same time established amazing local connections,\u201d Sam says.

But that has changed: now, mine is the group ever more likely to be splitting up. Between 2002 and 2022, the number of over-65s getting divorced each year in England and Wales more than tripled, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics. What has happened? Partly, it\u2019s about life expectancy increasing and life opportunities expanding when we retire. That is positive, because what it says is: \u201cI\u2019ve still got enough life to look forward to and I want it to be as happy and fulfilling as possible.\u201d The truth is \u2013 and, as a woman in her 60s, I see this all around \u2013 that some couples have evolved a convenient cohabiting arrangement that lacks intimacy and compassion. Then, suddenly, it\u2019s no longer convenient: the adult children, who tend to stay at home longer than they used to, eventually go and the day of reckoning arrives. As at any stage of a relationship, the crux is whether being with a person enhances your life, or detracts from it. If it\u2019s the second, is it \u2013 through therapy and changed behaviour \u2013 mendable? To which another caveat could be added: is the mend worth the pain and effort? Sometimes, the answer is no. \u201cIt might be time to split,\u201d says the couples and psychosexual therapist Tamara Hoyton. \u201cIt might be a case of: \u2018The children are financially independent and I\u2019m bored with you. This relationship holds no spice and I\u2019m running out of life.\u2019\u201d But no path is pain-free and, for many of us sixtysomethings, the hurt of staying in a relationship is less than that we would experience dismantling it. Of course, if you feel you have something to build on, then it\u2019s all to play for; I have been married for 35 years and I would say the past five have been our happiest. Looking back, you can see how often you were both just rattling on, heads down, coping with demanding young kids and then demanding older kids, alongside career pressures and financial worries. But life is not over yet \u2013 and the road ahead may be as bumpy as the road travelled. Retirement brings challenges. It\u2019s a huge life shift that affects our sense of self, our sense of autonomy, our perceived power within our relationships and \u2013 just as importantly \u2013 how to spend our time. \u201cPeople tend not to think enough about how retirement will affect them as a couple,\u201d says Hoyton. \u201cSo, she says: \u2018I\u2019m going to become the chair of governors at the local school,\u2019 and he says: \u2018I thought we were going on lots of golfing holidays.\u2019 Don\u2019t assume your partner will have the same ideas as you about the future. Talk about it.\u201d Think about balance: you will still need time apart, as well as time together. One thing to keep in mind, says Hoyton, is that retirement isn\u2019t one-dimensional. There are probably more possibilities within it than ever before. \u201cIt can be as exciting as you want,\u201d she says. Flexibility, as at any stage of a relationship, is crucial. If you are willing to think creatively, you will reap the rewards. Know, too, that age is no barrier to your need for closeness, companionship, intimacy and fun. \u201cToo many people think they\u2019ve gone past the time when they should be having a happy sex life or exciting nights out,\u201d says Dr Tara Quinn-Cirillo, an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society. \u201cOr they have people, maybe their adult children, questioning their decisions: \u2018Why are you dating again after Dad has died?\u2019\u201d Stand your ground, defend your right to a pleasure-filled life and know that it\u2019s worth the battle. Hoyton\u2019s top tip? Stay curious. \u201cIt\u2019s so fruitful,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can be curious about who you are in your relationship, and who your partner is, you\u2019re in the best possible place to work things out.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-17", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Joanna Moorhead", "id": 435, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/83b9278213d818e2276c447bd4d72da2d3986e59/0_0_1648_989/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018I go crazy in the presence of beauty\u2019: the colourful confessions of photographer Walter Pfeiffer", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/feb/20/beauty-confessions-photographer-walter-pfeiffer-insta-swiss", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.086, "neu": 0.703, "pos": 0.211, "compound": 0.9989}, "body": "Walter Pfeiffer\u2019s hands have trembled ever since he was a little boy at primary school. The problem, recalls the Swiss photographer, only intensified as he aged. \u201cIt amuses me,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen people call me a genius for using flash from the very beginning. It gave me my style \u2013 but I only did it because a flash stabilised my images.\u201d Pfeiffer\u2019s photographs exude a perpetual summery warmth, as if all the harshness of life has been banished. Before gaining recognition in the art world, he spent years shooting for the underground gay zine scene. Remarkably, after achieving success, he refused to change his approach: it has always been just him and his subject, like a painter with a muse. These are mostly young men, often captured in moments of exuberance, leaping in the air or striking a pose at home or by the lake. Many shots hover between dream and reality, seeming to speak of first love. \u201cPeople I don\u2019t like leave me cold,\u201d says Pfeiffer. \u201cBut in the presence of real beauty, I go crazy \u2013 and I could work for 24 hours. Beauty is rare, not an everyday occurrence, and it\u2019s better that way. If there was too much beauty around we would grow bored with it.\u201d He laughs. As you flip through Chez Walti Photographs 2000-2022, his latest book, an epic volume spanning 400 pages, you soon grasp how much energy he puts into his craft. While photography still excites him as much as it did in the early days, taking pictures is becoming increasingly strenuous \u2013 partly because of his unsteady hands but also due to the difficulty of finding the right models. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not a drama queen,\u201d he says. \u201cI truly mean it. If I hadn\u2019t been an artist, my life would have been easier.\u201d Pfeiffer, although a seasoned photographer of 50 years, was unearthed by millennials, who became enamoured of his hyper-colourful shots in the early 2000s. According to Pfeiffer, they embraced him for the same reasons the art world had rejected him. His photographs seemed overly simple, almost amateur. The fashion industry, even more so, tends to value intricacy and depth. However, as social media boomed, Pfeiffer\u2019s work began to stand out. It was seen as innovative, ahead of its time. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to earn it all, step by step. I never thought I would make it this far. People consistently put me down, claiming I was just a \u2018naive\u2019 photographer. After a while, you end up believing it.\u201d A monumental Pfeiffer retrospective recently concluded at the Kunstmuseum in Lucerne, and his book signings at cities across Europe always draw huge queues of fervent young photography enthusiasts. Few artists have demonstrated such an enviable ability to foresee \u2013 and perhaps lead \u2013 taste. It\u2019s no coincidence, although it is certainly ironic, that Pfeiffer is now embraced by the fashion industry. \u201cIn the beginning,\u201d says the 77-year-old, \u201cart directors would approach me with mood boards, sketches and ideas. Oh God, I was so frightened! I\u2019d listen to them but eventually I\u2019d say, \u2018Listen, what\u2019s the point of doing something that others have already done?\u2019 I didn\u2019t have an agent at that time. I am a self-taught artist and, frankly, I didn\u2019t know how to handle that kind of stuff. I\u2019m not a professional. When I had to go to London for a fashion shoot, I was so financially strained that I could only afford a second-rate hotel and had to compress everything into a two-day window. Again, this is the story of my life.\u201d He remembers i-D magazine sending a sizeable box of exorbitantly priced clothes to his Zurich apartment for a photography session. Fearful of damaging the valuable garments in transit, Pfeiffer had them modelled in his living room. In fact, he has never had his own studio. Nor does he like to preconceive an image. His ideal approach involves meeting the subject then, much like on a blind date, embracing whatever vibe unfolds. \u201cQue sera sera,\u201d he says with a shrug. The results are generally on the lighthearted side, although there is nothing vague about them. Pfeiffer, born in the Swiss countryside \u201con the same day and year as Bruce Weber\u201d, originally trained as a painter. \u201cI would use Polaroids as aids,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThen, in the 1970s, I bought a small automatic camera.\u201d Around the same time, he relocated to the city. \u201cMy first models were beautiful Zurich street kids. The pursuit of real beauty is the goal of my life. Even today, the people I photograph evoke the Hollywood stars of the 1950s. But they don\u2019t have to be aware of that. I prefer non-professional models. I never had models \u2013 I had real people.\u201d The film stars he would see at the cinema felt like people he was growing up with. As models, he still regards them as unsurpassed. \u201cThere are a lot of mirrors and glasses in my pictures, a tribute to my enduring passion for Hollywood and for Cecil Beaton, with his magnificent photographs featuring mirrors. It\u2019s about unattainable perfection. I never quite reach it, so I simplify it. I\u2019ve had several Cecil Beaton moments.\u201d Pfeiffer realised he was gay at the age of 16. \u201cI was the naive country boy. One day I met a man who was gay, but I didn\u2019t even know what that meant. He introduced me to [gay magazine] Der Kreis.\u201d During that time Pfeiffer also fell for the homoerotic photographs of Karlheinz Weinberger and the highly masculinised drawings of Tom of Finland. \u201cI was captivated by all that beauty and couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening inside me. Those were different times. You couldn\u2019t just say, \u2018I\u2019m 16 and I\u2019m gay.\u2019 Now, it\u2019s like a seal has been broken.\u201d After photographing his friends in the 1970s, he decided to publish his first book, now a rare find fetching giddying prices online. \u201cIt was produced by a publisher so impoverished that we had to convert all my photos to black and white to reduce the printing costs. It\u2019s still a good book, though. It doesn\u2019t age. You must be very careful when publishing a book: some get old while others remain timeless. I have so many books that already look dated even though they were published just three years ago.\u201d From then on, he says, his life became a constant and often exhausting pursuit of beauty. \u201cIt\u2019s my obsession,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes me click click click. I\u2019m obsessed with all those people who take me to new ground, new ideas. When people are boring \u2013 mamma mia! \u2013 it\u2019s terrible. Too much work. But when the right thing comes along, I feel alive again, although I\u2019m getting slower with age.\u201d We are in the caf\u00e9 of the Swiss National Museum in Zurich. Pfeiffer, drinking tea, reveals that he has been working on an archive for some time. It\u2019s not thousands of images, as one might assume. \u201cI used to shoot analogue,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t always have the money to buy film and develop photos. So in the early days, during fashion shoots, I would be like, \u2018Click, click, click \u2013 OK, we have it!\u2019 But only because it was all too expensive for me.\u201d In addition to mirrors, another thread running through Pfeiffer\u2019s work is flowers. They often adorn the hair or faces of his models, reminiscent of the images of Baron von Gloeden, known for his nude shots of young Sicilian men. However, unlike the German baron, Pfeiffer uses kitsch and camp in an ironic manner. His models wear flashy chandeliers instead of hats, while a garish piece of cloth might be wound into a turban. \u201cI think a good photograph needs no explanation,\u201d he says. \u201cOne should not even think, but just be amazed.\u201d Despite having photographed for the likes of Vogue and Vanity Fair, shooting everyone from Tom Ford to Tilda Swinton, the undercurrent of first love is something Pfeiffer is constantly, almost desperately, trying to convey. \u201cOf course I feel love for my models,\u201d he says. \u201cLove is necessary for my work. But I must maintain a certain distance. If there\u2019s no distance and you\u2019re in love, well, then you\u2019re blind.\u201d He laughs and takes a sip of tea. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not ideal to be blind \u2013 especially if your hands are constantly shaking.\u201d \u2022 Chez Walti Photographs 2000-2022 is published by Edition Patrick Frey", "date": "2024-02-20", "section": "Art and design", "author": "Maurizio Fiorino", "id": 436, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/904e5e6d9301346e8df37bf6cdfb5f906d81a08d/0_210_4000_2400/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Skull and Bones review \u2013 yo ho ho and some pockets of fun", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/20/skull-and-bones-review-ubisoft", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.111, "neu": 0.63, "pos": 0.259, "compound": 0.9971}, "body": "The frustrating thing about this swashbuckling multiplayer game from Ubisoft, which has reportedly been in development hell for about a decade, is that it\u2019s almost good. Some things about it are good, such as the ship battles, which are intriguingly customisable, more flexible than you\u2019d expect, even thrilling when you\u2019re up against a well-matched opponent. And when you\u2019re sailing from the African coast to the East Indies, or through river channels with tropical wilderness on all sides, you cannot help but admire how beautiful this game can be. And some things about it may become good; right now, the menus are confusing, and it\u2019s slow and turgid for hours before your piratical expeditions become more exciting, but a few tweaks could really pick up the pace. This is a live-service game, so it has room to evolve. But some things about Skull and Bones will never be good, at least not without tearing them down and starting again, which after years of expensive delays seems unlikely to happen. All of the characters in this game have dead eyes, and only their lips move when they speak to you. The story is so boring that after more than 20 hours on the seas, I can tell you the relative worth of uncut gems and where to sell your tobacco for the best price, but not the name of a single character or faction. And when you are on land, there\u2019s nothing to do \u2013 no sword fighting, no treasure-hunting, no meaningful exploration. Immense effort has been expended on creating small oases of land, and then nothing ever exists there except a couple of quest-givers and a bonfire. Only two more populous pirate-hub settlements exist on the whole map, where you can at least find a blacksmith or a tavern, but finding other interesting places to dock is a bust. This means that you\u2019ll spend 90% of your time sailing, because all the action is on the waves. And when you\u2019re not trying to ransack a merchant ship or defending yourself from other pirates, all that sailing involves is hoisting or lowering your sails, and occasionally adjusting your trajectory. It\u2019s boring, but I actually found it peaceful ferrying things around and enjoying the scenery. The Indian Ocean is the best thing about Skull and Bones: I felt quiet awe in occasional moments, such as when I was steering my svelte cutter through a tight pass, rocks rearing up on all sidesas I rounded a corner to see a waterfall tumbling from above as the sun was setting, soundtracked by my crew\u2019s shanties. In that moment, like Ubisoft\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed games sometimes do, Skull and Bones felt like a recreation of a lost time, breathing new life into the golden age of piracy. Unfortunately, Assassin\u2019s Creed is the elephant (seal) in the room here. Skull and Bones was inspired by 2013\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed: Black Flag, a hugely enjoyable pirate-flavoured adventure that really felt like an adventure, with islands to explore and things to discover and a plethora of interesting stories to find alongside the thrill of sailing and firing cannonballs at foes. 2018\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, too, features splendid seafaring on the azure ancient Grecian waters, and plenty else to do besides. Skull and Bones elevates the sailing ever so slightly, and has much better ship crafting \u2013 changing your seacraft and your weapons about really does alter how you play \u2013 but it has nothing else to offer, none of the personality or intrigue of the games that inspired it. The other game that can\u2019t escape mention here is Rare\u2019s Sea of Thieves, another online pirate action game that launched in a barren state in 2018 but has since evolved into a terrific time with friends, as funny and chaotic and characterful as you could hope a pirate game to be. But Skull and Bones is much more serious and solitary, a different game entirely \u2013 it reminded me much more of Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates than Sea of Thieves, in that most of the game is really about transporting cargo around and meddling with coloniser factions. The further in you get, the more Skull and Bones becomes about making, selling and transporting hidden-market goods, or sinking other players to steal theirs. It\u2019s a trade and naval battle simulator, really, more than a pirate game. It has no swagger, but it does have good seafaring and an excellent selection of tricorn hats. If its publisher Ubisoft continues to support it, Skull and Bones will attract a committed player base of sea-combat enthusiasts who enjoy tinkering with their ships\u2019 builds and facing off against each other, or teaming up to take on the intimidating fleets, cargo heists and sea monsters that lurk tens of hours in. If you are after a game that feels like a pirate adventure, though, you\u2019re still better off with Black Flag.

While often bold and brimming with smart theatrical ideas, it\u2019s a little uncertain of what it wants to be \u2013 just like the hormonal adolescents at its centre. Teenager Jax (\u201cshe/they/whatever\u201d) lives with her doting and supportive nan in a small Welsh village, passing the days with friends in the park and failing to get a job at the local chippy. That is until one day Ffion appears at the bus stop, armed with queer theory and poetry and terminology. Sparks fly, kisses are exchanged and climaxes reached as Jax navigates the turbulence of rural adolescence. Written by Bethan Marlow, with music by Nicola T Chang, Izzy Rabey\u2019s production moves at a brisk pace, possessing an impressive athletic dynamism, aided by musical director Alex Comana performing live on stage, Osian Meilir\u2019s muscular choreography and Cara Evans\u2019s design of ladders and climbing frames. Marty Langthorne\u2019s lighting is exquisite, as if the stage is a pulsating heart, fit to burst. As Jax, Rebecca Hayes carries proceedings with a sharp focus and Carys Eleri\u2019s funny and moving performance as Nan is especially lovely. The entire ensemble are more than up to the task, doubling as relatives and friends as well as giving voice to Jax\u2019s inner conflicting voices (echoing the conceit of the Thoughts in another queer musical, A Strange Loop). The 75 minutes whiz by with little pause but everything happens so quickly that there\u2019s little dramatic build-up and little to resolve. Catastrophes are swiftly overcome, forgiveness quickly granted to fairly unforgivable transgressions and an agitprop detour feels unearned. Perhaps this is dramatic structure as hormonal flux, and while it\u2019s refreshing to have a musical that centres queerness without making either gender or sexuality the source of dramatic tension, it causes the narrative to feel inconsequential.

The commissioner, who is responsible for ensuring the public service meets its ethical and integrity standards, highlighted the letter in a submission to an ongoing parliamentary inquiry into the ethics and accountability of the consulting industry. Sections of the letter seen by Guardian Australia reveal the commissioner asked secretaries to \u201censure you and your senior executive service employees have up-to-date declarations in place, as well as strategies in your agency to mitigate or manage conflicts that are identified\u201d. \u201cI ask, too, that you ensure similar arrangements are in place for all relevant agency functions and processes, such that conflict of interest declarations are triggered for those participating in activities such as recruitment, procurement, awarding grants, or performing regulatory roles,\u201d De Brouwer said. He told senior executives that \u201cconflicts of interest can also arise from personal relationships, including relationships with colleagues\u201d. It is not known what incident, if any, prompted the commissioner to issue the warning. \u201cIt is essential that these relationships be declared and properly managed in order to mitigate any real or apparent conflict with employees\u2019 official duties,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe risks associated with such relationships are heightened where there is a supervisory relationship or a power imbalance between the individuals. \u201cI ask that you ensure that you and your senior staff understand the obligations to take reasonable steps to avoid conflicts of interest and to declare and manage those conflicts that cannot be avoided.\u201d While the letter did not cite any specific examples, several department leaders have faced scrutiny for conflict of interest controversies in recent months. In March, a review by former senior public servant Ian Watt found taxpayers forked out $374m for contracts deemed to be poor value for money and have perceived conflicts of interest. Earlier this month, the secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, David Fredericks, criticised EY Oceania\u2019s conflict of interest disclosures. He signalled his team would be taking a tougher approach in future. As revealed by Guardian Australia, the firm was supporting the oil and gas industry\u2019s lobbying efforts while being paid by for independent advice on the government\u2019s signature climate policy and gas emissions. The firm has denied any conflict of interest, but did not inform the department of its separate engagements. Fredericks told a Senate estimates hearing it was also important for firms to address the \u201cperception\u201d of a conflict of interest and that \u201cit\u2019s very clear in this instance that EY fell short\u201d of that. \u201cIt is something \u2026 that we all need to keep a very sharp eye on going forward as well,\u201d he said. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission has also faced criticism after it revealed four consultancy firms disclosed more than 520 real, potential or perceived conflicts of interest while being paid more than $40m to audit the safety and quality of aged care homes over two years. The commission said no work was assigned to consultants who disclosed a conflict but many senators, unions and transparency watchdogs have questioned whether they should have been employed at all.

Last September there was a big 1.3% jump in wages. If you had just looked at that period in isolation, you would have thought the mythical wage breakout was about to occur and the RBA would be off to the races raising rates higher and higher. But in December overall wages grew by a much more moderate 0.95% and private-sector wages rose just 0.88%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup If the graph does not display click here The reason wage growth in December was even that large was due to the biggest jump in public-sector wages since 2008. But even that 1.3% quarterly increase should not be all the surprising or concerning for the RBA, given over the past three years public-sector wages have lagged behind that of the private sector. After years of enduring arbitrary wage caps, public-sector workers are seeking some redress. But while there has been a jump, in a majority of states and territories, the wage growth in the public sector lags well behind \u2013 especially in South Australia and the ACT with its mostly commonwealth public servants: If the graph does not display click here While the annual growth of all wages continues to rise \u2013 now up to 4.2% \u2013 private-sector wage growth looks like it has peaked: If the graph does not display click here This accords with the most recent wage growth figures from the Fair Work Commission for enterprise agreements. After solid increases in the middle of last year, wage growth in agreements has stayed around 4.2% since October: If the graph does not display click here It all suggests that concern wages are about to drive inflation and thus interest rates higher rather overblown. Wages are actually growing quite sensibly and finally (finally!) they are growing faster than inflation. It is often forgotten amid all the talk about \u201cexcess demand\u201d and \u201cwage-price inflation\u201d that wages should grow faster than inflation. It\u2019s a key to improved living standards. And yet for the past few years that has not happened. However, in 2023 inflation rose 4.05% while the wage price index rose 4.2%. That means for the first time since March 2021 people\u2019s wages are higher in real terms now than they were a year ago. If the graph does not display click here While that is good news, it\u2019s such small growth that it\u2019s likely people\u2019s real after-tax wage did not go up. Similarly, while wages rose faster than total inflation, they rose by less than the prices of non-discretionary items. Because low- and middle-income earners spend more of their income on those essential items, it means they are also less likely to have seen an increase in their ability to buy more with their pay. As it stands, we have a very long way to recover our lost real wages. This recent increase only puts the level of real wages back to where they were in September 2011: If the graph does not display click here It also means that the average wage still buys about 5% less than it did in March 2020. While the RBA has continued to talk up the stock of household savings that is helping bolster spending (and thus demand), for those households who rely overwhelmingly on their wages, the past three years have been historically brutal. The good news is the recent stronger wage growth is pretty widespread. Last year the wage growth in around half of all industries was faster than inflation, but wage growth in all industries remain a long way behind the increase in prices since the start of the pandemic: If the graph does not display click here And while the news of wages rising faster than inflation will be welcome to workers, businesses and employers will be less impressed given the many efforts they undertake to keep wages down. One tactic they use involves forcing workers to sign \u201cnon-compete\u201d clauses that prevents workers from leaving one job and going to work for a competitor. This keeps wages down because it means people can\u2019t leave one place and go elsewhere for better pay. New data from the ABS shows that more than one in five businesses have such non-compete clauses, and the bigger the business the more likely it has such a contract in place. If the graph does not display click here While such contracts make sense for, say, CEOs of a grocery company, they make no sense for someone who just works in the store. And yet the ABS found that such restraints \u2013 including non-disclosure clauses \u2013 cover 68% of upper-level managers or executives, but applied to 75% of other employees. Such clauses mean big businesses don\u2019t need to worry about a competitor raising wages to poach their best workers. It\u2019s a good reminder that, just as recent inquiries have found, businesses don\u2019t like to compete to keep prices down, they also don\u2019t like competing with each other to send wages up.

Russia and North Korea have been moving closer since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with Kim meeting Putin in Russia\u2019s far east in September. US and South Korean officials say that Russia, long a pre-eminent military power, has become so desperate to replenish its arsenal that it has turned to North Korean and Iranian imports. Echoing an earlier statement from South Korea, the United States said that the gift would go against a UN security council ban on sending luxury goods to North Korea, which has defiantly carried out years of nuclear and missile tests. \u201cIf this is true, it would appear to be once again Russia violating UN security council resolutions that it itself supported,\u201d Miller said. Russia\u2019s best-known car is the Lada, which became the butt of jokes in the West during the cold war due to its no-frills utilitarian design, with its ultra-low price drawing budget-conscious drivers outside the Soviet bloc.

His second novel, I See Buildings Fall Like Lightning, is a worthy successor. A multivocal narrative focusing on a working-class community in Birmingham, it follows Rian, Patrick, Shiv, Oli and Conor as they grow up and grow apart. Rian has left Birmingham and got rich, more or less by accident, playing the stock market on his laptop; the other four stayed behind. As Goddard observes in a striking opening sentence, \u201cAnd then none of it happened.\u201d Life came at them fast, and none of their dreams has come true. Patrick works as a takeaway delivery biker, and has two children with Shiv; Oli is a drug dealer too fond of his own supply; Conor has a chaotic home life, and a plan to make things better. At the beginning of the novel, these childhood friends get together for a night out, and Conor asks Rian if he can borrow money to embark on a construction project. By the end of the book, they\u2019ve gone through a tragedy that seems to have cut them off definitively from their past. There\u2019s a subtly radical treatment of narrative here. Rather than kinetic or dynamic storytelling, what Goddard offers as he switches between the voices of his five main characters is a series of tableaux and character studies; internal monologues presenting the latest state of affairs, while the plot goes on seemingly just behind the text, reported to but not exactly witnessed by the reader. At its best, the technique is reminiscent of Jon McGregor\u2019s most successful novels, If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things and Reservoir 13; voices and images succeed one another, accumulating into a composite portrait of people becoming unmoored from youth. It\u2019s not always entirely satisfying, as the technique dispenses with the pleasure of pure, live storytelling, one thing flowing into another. There\u2019s little vocal differentiation, and so without conventional dramatic scenarios in which the characters can extensively interact, the text sometimes becomes a monochrome reading experience. There is also a slight tension between the book\u2019s close focus on a small friendship group and its occasional gestures towards having something larger to say about Birmingham, or even England. Goddard\u2019s characters each feel isolated within their own lives, and remain isolated from the wider world when they get together; what the novel studies is a friendship group, not a wider community. Many great writers about work, from Robert Tressell to David Storey and right up to Boiling Point on the BBC last year, have sought to dramatise the hustle and bustle of a workplace; the building site at the heart of Goddard\u2019s novel is only really seen and overheard from a distance. However, these are caveats that do not obscure the success of a moving and highly successful character portrait. The cliche goes that second novels, like second albums, are tricky to navigate; having had the whole of their lives to get the first ones right, writers sign contracts giving them 18 months or two years in which to repeat the trick. It\u2019s a lazy reading of how artists develop. Whether they succeed or not, second novels are the moment when a new way of seeing the world, announced with the writer\u2019s debut, begins to develop and grow \u2013 the single book gives way to the multifaceted career, and the writer\u2019s direction of future travel begins to emerge. This novel left me eager to follow Goddard\u2019s work as he continues to develop. \u2022 I See Buildings Fall Like Lightning by Keiran Goddard is published by Abacus (\u00a316.99) in the UK and on 14 May in Australia.

The 70-year-old, a member of the Kennedy political dynasty, with a long history of promoting conspiracy theories and vaccine skepticism, is running for president as an independent. Recent polling from Quinnipiac projected that in a race involving Biden and Trump, Kennedy, who has pledged to \u201cend the forever wars, clean up government [and] increase wealth for all\u201d, could receive as much as 15% of the vote. Kennedy has been campaigning across the country for months, and on Wednesday he was on his home turf of Los Angeles, where his wife, Cheryl Hines, the Curb Your Enthusiasm star, hosted a fundraiser in the form of a comedy show. The event was open to anyone with $150 to spare and promised a \u201cNight of Laughter\u201d with standup from names such as Adam Carolla, Jeremy Piven and Rob Schneider \u2013 the one-time SNL star and now conservative influencer. Hundreds of people lined up around the theater, eager to hear from Kennedy and excited about the possibility of a third-party candidate. \u201cThis makes me think think he has a chance,\u201d Burke Smith said as he pointed to the line. Smith, who drove up from San Diego, said he likes Donald Trump but would prefer Kennedy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck in the two-party system for so long. He represents the embodiment of what the middle of the road is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe speaks to the majority of the people.\u201d Kennedy has polled higher than expected and drawn support from both Democrats and Republicans, though a review by FiveThirtyEight of eight polls on his popularity found that he was better liked among Republicans, which some experts believe is due to his promotion of conspiracy theories and role as an anti-vaccine activist. Kennedy, the son of the US attorney general and presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy, and the nephew of John F Kennedy, has been in the public eye for decades, and previously drew attention for his work as a bestselling author and environmental lawyer. But in recent years he has become a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement, and started a non-profit that has promoted misinformation about vaccines and Covid public-health measures. Public health experts have described his work as misleading and harmful, as have family members. His family has also expressed their opposition to his presidential campaign, with his siblings describing his decision to run as \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d. Last year, he made comments linking antidepressants to school shootings; claimed that chemicals in water are causing more kids to identify as transgender; and promoted a conspiracy theory that Covid was \u201ctargeted\u201d to Black and white people while Chinese and Jewish people were \u201cmost immune\u201d. Those in attendance at Wednesday\u2019s event wanted to hear from Kennedy first-hand. For his part, Smith said he liked that Kennedy had done his own research on vaccines, unlike Trump or Biden. Still, he described himself as on the fence about how he would vote, but said he was hopeful that, with enough support, Kennedy could provide the change he believes the country badly needs. Aside from brief remarks from Kennedy at the end of the evening and pleas from Hines to vote and to help him get on the ballot, the evening was entirely focused on comedy \u2013 often with plenty of culture-war zingers. The crowd was younger than expected and included no shortage of designer shoes and $2,000 handbags. The front row featured familiar faces such as Dr Drew Pinsky and Drea de Matteo, both ardent supporters of Kennedy. Some comedians did not touch on politics at all, but jokes about Biden falling or the pandemic being \u201cdesigned\u201d drew rapturous applause, as did a line about Larry David\u2019s support for Barack Obama. The creator of Curb Your Enthusiasm told the New York Times last year that he is not backing Kennedy\u2019s candidacy. Mentions of California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, unsurprisingly also elicited boos. The jokes included plenty of complaints about woke culture, reverse racism and a bit from Schneider comparing Mexican people to pests. Schneider, once known for his roles in Adam Sandler movies, has embraced conservative causes in recent years. Schneider praised Kennedy for his \u201csacrifice\u201d in trying to contribute to his country. The millionaire also got in digs at unhoused people in California as well as crime in the Golden State and complaints about the Democratic party. Kennedy spoke for just a moment, thanking the crowd for their passion and intensity before heading off to an after-party (tickets to that event cost $1,000) where he was set to make a speech.

She wants more friends in attendance, real or pretend. The comments section floods: people offer to throw her a hen weekend and to travel from interstate for the big day. Those who live close suggest catching up for a coffee with the goal of striking up a real friendship. And one commenter admits that looking at her own wedding photographs now makes her sad because of how few friends she has. Every day in this group, people \u2013 mostly women \u2013 across Australia ask and answer big questions like that among themselves. Posts span from silly and surface-level to vulnerable and heartbreaking. A 21-year-old about to marry the father of her children asks whether her hesitations constitute cold feet or something bigger. Another woman in another post shares that she and her fiance have decided not to get married and wonders whether the relationship can be resuscitated once the pressure of a wedding is removed. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The responses to both posts are gentle and generous; some suggest counselling, others ways to reconnect. A few share words of warning about the weddings they went through with, against their gut feelings, urging these women not to do the same. I have seen threads with women offering up their preloved dresses to brides who\u2019ve realised theirs isn\u2019t right; asking for advice upon finding out they\u2019re pregnant; wondering how to navigate hurt feelings around elopements; honour a loved one who has died or respond when someone receives a challenging health diagnosis. There are many questions about money, from how to pay (\u201cSavings? Loan? Credit card?\u201d) to shaving down the cost. Renee Apap, married last June, joined the group for just that reason: \u201cTo help keep costs down, and work out where and if I was getting ripped off.\u201d She is still a member now. Kerry Graham told me she used the group to find \u201csupport with body positivity\u201d, including suggestions for dresses and beauty services \u201cwithout judgment\u201d. Now married, she has remained in the group \u201cas I love seeing people\u2019s weddings come together\u201d and enjoys suggesting budget-friendly ideas. \u201cI feel good to know you can help someone save costs, even if a little.\u201d Jessica Barker originally came for the savings, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been broke since planning the wedding, so being able to save here and there was a true blessing.\u201d But more than that, Barker was looking for a community, because \u201cmy mum has passed away, and \u2026 [I] didn\u2019t really have the best idea how to plan myself.\u201d One bride posts wedding photos to the group after going ahead with her elopement just days after a miscarriage. At the time of writing, the post has 938 likes and dozens of comments expressing well wishes and condolences. One woman in the comments thread shares a similar story of her own, saying she understands the way a wedding after a period of loss acts as a light at the end of the tunnel. There is tenderness and connection here. I\u2019m not alone in feeling it or in sticking around. This is the power that safe digital spaces can hold. For me this wedding-related Facebook group offers a daily dose of generosity and humanity; for others it could be a Discord server, Reddit thread, a fan account or a high school group chat. We might not contribute to their rhythms, but it can be enough just to exist in these online villages, to wander their streets and pause to eavesdrop. Even if they\u2019re no longer useful, we\u2019re drawn back by our curiosity, nostalgia or plain old nosiness. When time spent online can so often make us feel worse about ourselves and the world, it makes a big difference to feel at home somewhere. Or as Bronwyn Pearce, married in October, still a member of the wedding group, puts it: \u201cAmongst all the \u2026 nonsense we see on socials, it\u2019s nice to scroll through photos of people\u2019s happiest moments.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-22", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Brittney Rigby", "id": 445, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b8a786055e2282b0b38614123247dd828923200a/11_644_3529_2117/500.jpg"}, {"title": "GCSE grades a good predictor of life chances and wellbeing, research shows", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/feb/22/gcse-grades-a-good-predictor-of-life-chances-and-wellbeing-research-shows", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.049, "neu": 0.712, "pos": 0.24, "compound": 0.9947}, "body": "GCSE grades have an excellent track record in predicting the future lives and careers of young adults, according to researchers, who found the exams were even more crucial for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Academics from Leeds and York universities found that the predictive power of GCSE results outstripped those of gender or later qualifications, including university degrees, in charting the development of young people from the age of 16 into their early 20s. \u201cWhat we can definitely say is that GCSEs have a considerable impact on how your life develops into your early 20s, and that the benefits from GCSEs are over and above the education someone obtains later,\u201d said Alexandra Starr, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of York and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThe main message I would say is that GCSE grades are important in real life. We always talk about whether exams are only important within the education system, to climb the next rung in the educational ladder. But it\u2019s also important beyond that.\u201d The research, published on Thursday in the journal Developmental Psychology, comes as nearly 800,000 students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland prepare to sit their GCSE exams this spring. The researchers interviewed 6,500 people aged 23, recording their GCSE grades and later qualifications such as A-levels and degrees, along with their current occupation, income and questions on their financial and emotional wellbeing, as well as other measures including family background. While those with strong GCSE results also did well in terms of university entry and prestigious occupations, the results were particularly marked for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s important to encourage children to perform well in school because it\u2019s important for their overall future. And it\u2019s important to acknowledge this is especially true for children from less privileged backgrounds,\u201d said Starr. \u201cFor them it is more important to obtain good grades at GCSE level, to then have further educational opportunities such as going to university and being admitted into the courses they want to study, compared to their more privileged peers, who might have more of a support system they can rely on.\u201d Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cEducation can be the great social leveller for children from under-resourced backgrounds \u2013 the huge challenge we face in the post-pandemic era is that too few are securing the basic GCSE grades needed to function and flourish in later life. \u201cOur country would be a fairer and more productive place if we targeted more education resources to those pupils who have been held back by the rising levels of inequality we are now experiencing.\u201d The Sutton Trust, which campaigns for social mobility through education, warned that there is a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d being created by the widening attainment gap between rich and poor pupils in England. The trust is calling for the next government to create a long-term national strategy to close the gap, including rebalancing funding back towards schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.", "date": "2024-02-22", "section": "Education", "author": "Richard Adams Education editor", "id": 446, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6e456f3a4725f7d5c05569f4f29d3ebd380aa5c2/0_26_3500_2102/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Seeing same GP \u2018improves patient health and cuts workload of doctors\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/23/seeing-same-gp-improves-patient-health-and-cuts-workload-of-doctors", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.039, "neu": 0.747, "pos": 0.214, "compound": 0.9985}, "body": "Seeing the same GP improves patients\u2019 health, reduces doctors\u2019 workloads and could free up millions of appointments, according to the largest study of its kind. Primary care is under enormous strain, with patients struggling to book consultations, GPs quitting or retiring early, and financial pressures causing some practices to close. Four-week waits hit a record high in 2023, with 17.6m appointments taking place at least 28 days after being booked in England last year. Research has previously suggested there may be benefits to seeing the same family doctor. But studies have mostly been small or covered a short period of time. Now University of Cambridge and Insead business school researchers have analysed data from 10m consultations over more than a decade in the most authoritative study on the issue yet. They found that if all GP practices moved to a model where patients saw the same doctor at each visit, it would significantly reduce doctors\u2019 workloads while improving patient health. Multiple benefits emerged when patients had a long-term relationship with their doctor, researchers found. Seeing the same GP \u2013 known as continuity of care \u2013 meant people waited on average 18% longer between visits, compared with patients who saw different doctors. People did not take up more GP time in each consultation and the findings were particularly strong for older patients, those with multiple chronic illnesses, and people with mental health conditions. Although it will not always be possible for people to see their regular GP, researchers said the findings would translate to an estimated 5% reduction in consultations if all practices provided the level of continuity of care of the best 10% of practices. That suggests millions of appointments could be freed up. The researchers added: \u201cImportantly, if patients receiving care from their regular doctors have longer intervals between consultations without requiring longer consultations, then continuity of care can potentially allow physicians to expand their patient list without increasing their time commitment.\u201d In the study published in the journal Management Science, experts analysed 10m consultations across 381 practices in England over 11 years. The study said: \u201cA physician can be considered more productive if they improve the quality of care provided without reducing the number of patients they serve per year or if they serve more patients without reducing quality of care. \u201cIn primary care, where patients often have a preferred doctor, these two dimensions are related. \u201cIf physicians provide high-quality care to their regular patients, they are likely to keep them healthier, which reduces the demand for consultations and increases their capacity to serve more patients.\u201d Analysis of England\u2019s GP patient survey data by the Nuffield Trust showed that when asked \u201chow often do you see or speak to your preferred GP when you would like to?\u201d, continuity of care has declined over time. Between 2018 and 2023, the proportion of patients who \u201calways or almost always\u201d saw or spoke to their preferred GP decreased from 26% to 16% while those who answered \u201cnever or almost never\u201d increased from 10% to 19%. A co-author of the study, Prof Stefan Scholtes, from Cambridge Judge Business School, said seeing the same doctor could have enormous benefits. \u201cThe impact is substantial: it could be the equivalent of increasing the GP workforce by 5%, which would significantly benefit both patients and the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter health translates into less demand for future consultations. Prioritising continuity of care is crucial in enhancing productivity.\u201d The UK has a major shortfall of GPs, according to the Health Foundation and the Nuffield Trust, with thousands more medics needed to meet demand. In the US, the Association of American Medical Colleges estimates a shortfall of up to 55,200 primary care physicians by 2033. \u201cGetting it right the first time\u201d would reduce GPs\u2019 future workloads by \u201cpreventing revisits\u201d, Prof Scholtes added. In the study, researchers used anonymised data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, consisting of more than 10m GP visits between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2017. The study restricted itself to patients who had at least three consultations over the previous two years. Dr Harshita Kajaria-Montag, lead author of the new study, who is now based at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University in the US, said: \u201cThe benefits of continuity of care are obvious from a relationship point of view. \u201cIf you\u2019re a patient with complex health needs, you don\u2019t want to have to explain your whole health history at every appointment. If you have a regular doctor who\u2019s familiar with your history, it\u2019s a far more efficient use of time, for doctor and patient.\u201d Dr Victoria Tzortziou-Brown, vice-chair of the Royal College of GPs, said continuity of care was \u201chighly valued by GPs and patients alike\u201d, adding: \u201cStudies such as this one are very important for informing future policy and practice. \u201cCurrently, the intense workload and workforce pressures GPs are facing \u2013 as well as political agendas prioritising speedy access to GP services above all else \u2013 greatly limit the level of continuity we can offer.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-23", "section": "Society", "author": "Andrew Gregory Health editor", "id": 447, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4068363652667360632b9d13e8c97c422a266623/0_21_3000_1801/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Blind date: \u2018She\u2019s had an illustrious writing career, but it felt like a conversation between equals\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/feb/23/blind-date-deborah-moggach-mike", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.056, "neu": 0.563, "pos": 0.382, "compound": 0.9991}, "body": "Deborah on Mike What were you hoping for? A possibility \u2013 the most alluring word I know. First impressions? Nice-looking, firm handshake. He\u2019d got us the best table, by the window. What did you talk about? Our pasts, our fathers\u2019 service in the war, the Labour party, our children, biking, sea swimming (which we both love, but I suspect he\u2019s more of a Lycra sporty person than me). Some techy stuff \u2013 he\u2019s far more involved in that than I am, being a mathematician/physicist, while I\u2019m deeply technophobic. And he asked masses about me, which was pretty unusual and very nice. Most awkward moment? None, as far as I\u2019m aware. We were both frank about our past forays into internet dating, which was rather companionable. Good table manners? Yes. And we shared the food, and indeed took photos of it, as we both have a foodie child. Best thing about Mike? Likable and easy to talk to. Would you introduce Mike to your friends? Yes, unless they had a dog \u2013 Mike doesn\u2019t like them, which is a bit of a deal-breaker. Describe Mike in three words. Well-mannered, chatty, curious. What do you think Mike made of you? God knows. Did you go on somewhere? No. I think we realised it was not to be, but gracefully exchanged phone numbers. I think it was a slight relief when I said: \u201cHere\u2019s the killer: I not only love dogs, but I like them sleeping on my bed.\u201d (I didn\u2019t add \u201cIn my bed\u201d, which is also true.) And \u2026 did you kiss? Cordial pecks on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the date, what would it be? Nothing really, it was fine. Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? Probably not. Mike on Deborah What were you hoping for? Nothing beyond a couple of hours of intelligent and amusing conversation. Deborah certainly delivered on both counts. First impressions? An attractive, lively and engaging woman. What did you talk about? We ranged across her writing career, my work, politics, relationships, our families, pastimes \u2013 and dogs. Most awkward moment? I don\u2019t recall any: we quickly settled into a relaxed and friendly conversation. Good table manners? Impeccable. We shared some of our dishes. Amusingly, neither of us touched so much as a single drop of alcohol. I hardly ever touch the stuff. It didn\u2019t inhibit a great conversation, though. Best thing about Deborah? Although she has had an illustrious writing career, I had no sense that she was condescending towards someone as ordinary as myself. It felt like a conversation between equals. Would you introduce Deborah to your friends? I would be very happy to; I think she would fit in very well, particularly with my literary friends. Describe Deborah in three words. Listener, informed, intelligent. What do you think Deborah made of you? Whatever she made of me, she was gracious enough to show what appeared to be a genuine interest in my life and careers. Did you go on somewhere? No. I believe Deborah said she had to get back for something else. And \u2026 did you kiss? We exchanged goodbye pecks on the cheeks, as you do with friends.

And it just makes you feel a bit sad, because it\u2019s like a dream that you don\u2019t want to wake up from.\u201d Kelsey isn\u2019t alone in experiencing a harsh comedown after the Melbourne leg of the Eras tour. On TikTok, fans are posting videos of themselves crying in the car on the way to work, \u201cnow permanently unfit to function normally\u201d, or asking followers what they\u2019re meant to do with their life now that Eras is over. On the social media platform X, others have said that after watching Swift perform, they\u2019re scared they\u2019ll \u201cnever feel the same happiness again\u201d. Melbourne Swiftie Rachel Turner says the blood, sweat, tears and money that went into attending the event makes the crash feel harder. \u201cHalf the country was in line for those tickets, and I spent hours and hours across so many different devices to be able to get the chance to go,\u201d she says. \u201cSince then I\u2019ve been in preparation mode for Eras. I\u2019ve been watching the TikToks, I\u2019ve been planning the outfits, I\u2019ve been strategising what era everyone should dress as for like three months. \u201cSo much effort, planning and anticipation really built up into one night, so I\u2019m definitely feeling like I\u2019ve closed the chapter.\u201d It \u201cabsolutely is\u201d normal to feel a little deflated after an anticipated event like the Eras tour, says Kayla Greenstien, a former counsellor and psychology PhD candidate who was on the steering committee of last week\u2019s Swiftposium, an academic conference devoted to assessing the musician\u2019s widespread impact. \u201cI think we see a similar thing with weddings,\u201d Greenstien says. \u201cFor people attending the Taylor Swift concert, the atmosphere created there is such a space of femininity \u2026 to step out of that concert space and go back into the real world, it\u2019s kind of like the Barbie movie effect \u2013 it can absolutely be jarring. So I think people really need to look out for themselves at this time.\u201d Greenstien, who doesn\u2019t identify as a full-blown Swiftie but is certainly \u201cSwift-curious\u201d, researches psychedelic therapy. She sees parallels between taking psychedelics and attending the Eras tour. Both have \u201ca lot of preparation and lead-up, and the experience is almost transcendental\u201d, she says. \u201cThe sense of connectedness that you have with others is extremely sparkly in the same way \u2026 someone might experience at a Taylor Swift concert.\u201d So what can be done when a lavender haze fades to blue like you\u2019ve never known? \u201cIn psychedelic therapy, we talk about integration, which is how you make sense of that profound experience you just had,\u201d Greenstien says. \u201cIt\u2019s worth reflecting on what was really so wonderful about that experience, because I think it goes beyond just seeing Taylor Swift \u2013 it\u2019s the atmosphere, the connectedness, the dressing up, going with family, going with friends.\u201d Greenstien says it\u2019s worth asking what positive things about the experience can be brought back into everyday life. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning To commemorate the event, she also suggests \u201cdoing something nice\u201d with photos and memorabilia from the show, such as printing pictures out and putting them in a scrapbook. Some Swifties have other suggestions. Blessed by the ticketing gods, \u201cproud Swiftie\u201d Lorrae McKenna went to two Eras shows in Melbourne. To ease the re-entry, McKenna and some friends she attended with plan to hold a screening of the Eras concert movie \u201cto help us process everything\u201d. Her comedown has been manageable, she says, except for the number of Swift tracks she has been playing. \u201cMy partner is like, \u2018You have a problem. And you need to stop listening now.\u2019\u201d McKenna says giving her friendship bracelets from the night to her children has helped too, because she enjoys seeing the thrill they get out of them. Turner has also taken solace in friendship bracelets. She is still wearing hers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an ironic gimmicky thing. I think that they\u2019re actually quite sweet and it\u2019s a memory that I\u2019ll cherish.\u201d She went to Eras with her older sister Jess, and spent the whole show \u201cscreaming, crying, singing and holding Jess\u2019 hand\u201d. Her elder sibling hasn\u2019t been in the same post-Eras funk, though \u2013 she\u2019s actually been riding a high ever since the confetti dropped. \u201c[Taylor Swift] just puts an ethos out into the world that if you lift other women up, and live your life leading with kindness, that you are the best or most powerful version of yourself,\u201d Jess says. \u201cI think that\u2019s really at the heart of it. When you go and are surrounded by 96,000 people that all buy into that, you can\u2019t help but walk out of that, just being like \u2026 \u2018People are awesome.\u2019 And you just are reminded to be a bit better every day.\u201d Jess doesn\u2019t want Swifties to be deterred by the party-pooping \u201cSwift grinches\u201d out there. She says those going to shows in Sydney should celebrate the night by posting their photos on social media. \u201cBask in it \u2013 just be like, \u2018That made me happy and I had a really fun time.\u2019 Don\u2019t hold back, just put it out in the world.\u201d For Kelsey, watching the videos she filmed on repeat at Eras has certainly helped with the comedown.

I\u2019d follow her around, begging her to stop doing her housework and read to me. When she did, it was usually from Grimms\u2019 fairytales, which we both loved. But she never read long enough to satisfy me; I always wanted her to go on. I didn\u2019t understand how housework could have been more important. (I still don\u2019t.) My favourite book growing up My early love of fairytales endured and I developed an equal love of myths. I had a paperback edition of Edith Hamilton\u2019s Mythology with illustrations by the startlingly named Steele Savage that was so well thumbed it ended up needing to be held together with rubber bands. As a lover of horses, I also became a devoted fan of the Black Stallion books by Walter Farley. The book that changed me as a teenager I remember a long night in the bathroom reading Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina while everyone else in the apartment slept. I remember thinking that I would rather read than sleep \u2013 that I\u2019d rather read than do anything \u2013 and how this set me apart from everyone I knew at the time. I knew how great the book in my hands was, and I understood, for what may have been the first time, how important to my life great books were going to be. The book that made me want to be a writer As a child I believed that I would write children\u2019s books, because those were the stories that made me want to invent stories of my own. I wanted to write about witches and little people and magical beasts and talking animals. When I was growing up I wanted to be Dr Seuss. The author I came back to In college I read some stories by John Cheever, and for reasons I\u2019ve never been able to fathom I did not think much of them. Luckily, about a decade later, when a collection of his stories was published to much acclaim, I tried again and became an ardent fan. Now I\u2019ve reread many of those 61 stories several times, and my love for this superb writer remains undiminished. The book I reread I often find myself wanting to read Proust again. Another book I keep returning to is Rilke\u2019s The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s poignant coming-of-age novel, Lucy, is a book I\u2019ve taught in various literature courses quite often over the years, and no matter how well I know it, rereading never fails to be a fresh and rewarding experience. The book I could never read again An exasperated English professor once barked at our class, \u201cOne of these damn days you\u2019re going to have to read the damn Bible.\u201d And so I did, cover to cover (King James Version). I don\u2019t remember how long it took, but even given another lifetime I can\u2019t imagine doing that again. The book I discovered later in life I came late to Christopher Isherwood, finally reading his Berlin Stories when I was around 60. I was so impressed that I immediately moved on to Prater Violet and A Single Man, and Isherwood became an influence on my own writing. The book I am currently reading Some years ago I read Walter Kempowski\u2019s final novel, All for Nothing, translated from the German by Anthea Bell. Set during the last days of the Third Reich, it\u2019s one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. Now I\u2019ve just begun his first novel, An Ordinary Youth, translated by Michael Lipkin. Originally published in 1971, it\u2019s an autobiographical novel based on Kempowski\u2019s boyhood in Nazi Germany. My comfort read I don\u2019t have what I\u2019d specifically call a comfort read. I\u2019d say any reading that engages my attention and gives me pleasure is a comfort to me. \u2022 The Vulnerables by Sigrid Nunez is published by Virago (\u00a316.99).

Two designated protest areas would be set up outside the venue, and security staff would be able to step in if needed; \u201cescalation procedures in case of a disruption\u201d would be sent later in the week. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The missive ahead of the event, which is on now, was delivered in \u201ca mutual spirit of safety, inclusivity, respect, courtesy and tolerance\u201d, and to create \u201ca safe space [for panellists] to share their voices\u201d. It is also a sign of the times. \u2018Event organisers have a duty of care\u2019 Writers\u2019 festivals have always married literary discussion with topical issues, bringing authors and commentators together to discuss not just their work but the world around it. Occasional flare-ups and stoushes are to be expected \u2013 but as debates over the Middle East crisis continue to filter through to all areas of public life, it has had a particularly divisive effect on Australia\u2019s arts industry, where pre-emptive risk management appears to be a new development. In a statement to the Guardian, Perth festival\u2019s artistic director, Iain Grandage, and Writing WA\u2019s chief executive, William Yeoman, said the festival had the responsibility to ensure the safety, comfort and enjoyment of all participants and staff. \u201cAll event organisers have a duty to care for their attenders and it is standard, prudent practice for them to consider a wide range of measures in their event management plans,\u201d the statement said. For Perth writers\u2019 weekend, the new safety measures haven\u2019t come out of nowhere. Last week an open letter to the festival was signed by hundreds of artists, musicians and academics, calling on the festival and Writing WA to issue a public apology to the Palestinian community over the decision to platform headliner Deborah Conway, an avowed Zionist, in its literature and ideas program. In January, Perth festival was already responding to complaints by unspecified groups over diversity and representation in the program. \u201cWhile programming decisions were made prior to these conflicts breaking out \u2026 we are bringing more authors to the writers\u2019 weekend,\u201d Yeoman wrote in an email in January. First Nations artist Mabel Gibson and three writers of Arab heritage were subsequently added to the lineup. \u2018We have to be able to hear other people\u2019 Controversy at Australian writers\u2019 festivals is nothing new. In 2016, Yassmin Abdel-Magied famously walked out of Lionel Shriver\u2019s keynote address at the Brisbane writers\u2019 festival, and accused the We Need to Talk About Kevin author of delivering \u201ca poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension\u201d. In 2018, the Sydney writer\u2019s festival became the scene of an international scandal, after American-Dominican novelist Junot D\u00edaz was publicly accused of sexual misconduct by a member of the audience, American writer Zinzi Clemmons. Diaz cancelled his scheduled appearances at the festival, and has denied the allegations. Ahead of last year\u2019s Adelaide writer\u2019s week, a storm brewed over the inclusion of Susan Abulhawa, a Palestinian-American writer who had described Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a \u201cNazi-promoting Zionist\u201d on Twitter; and Palestinian poet Mohammed El-Kurd, whose poetry the Anti-Defamation League criticised as antisemitic. Sponsors pulled out, as did three Ukrainian authors, and Adler faced down the media, arguing against the conflation of criticism of Israel with antisemitism, and arguing for the freedom of discussion and debate. \u201cNone of this is simple,\u201d she told the Guardian at the time. \u201cPeople are free to deeply object.\u201d A fortnight away from this year\u2019s festival, Adler has found herself once more in the firing line after The Australian\u2019s literary editor Caroline Overington described the 2024 program as being \u201cpositively stuffed with guests whose views on the conflict in the Middle East are frothingly anti-Israel\u201d. \u201cThere are five writers talking about the history of the Middle East, five out of 202 writers, and not one of them would agree with the other,\u201d Adler told the Guardian this week. \u201cIf that\u2019s called a program packed with anti-Israel individuals, then [The Australian] and I are obviously working with different abacuses.\u201d Adler says there will be no new safety measures put in place for this year\u2019s writer\u2019s week. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a civil, courteous and polite exchange of views. Yes, sometimes views are expressed with passion \u2013 but why are we so frightened of that?\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to be able to hear other people, that\u2019s what I think is important. And passion or commitment to one\u2019s opinion is perfectly legitimate.\u201d \u201cThe moderators have the power of the microphone, and the right to switch it off during Q&amp;As if an audience member becomes offensive, racist or derogatory,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be done with dignity and authority.\u201d \u2018The more you mediate this, the less you fulfil the brief\u2019 Before he was editor of the Monthly, Michael Williams was artistic director of Sydney writers\u2019 festival, and head programmer for the Wheeler Centre. He\u2019s a frequent moderator of panels and talks at writers\u2019 festivals, which he sees as platforms for public discourse where conflicts of opinion are inevitable. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be in a place where there\u2019s public protests or anxiety expressed about government policy, or questions being asked about human rights, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be putting on a public ideas festival right now, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly the narrowest and most prescriptive program avoids being about the world at large.\u201d Williams says he understands Perth festival\u2019s anxiety over maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all participants. \u201cBut short of making sure that people avoid deliberately hurting or vilifying others, going beyond that comes across as overthinking,\u201d he says. \u201cThe value of a writers\u2019 festival is that it is live \u2013 people who have thought deeply about the ideas coming together to talk in an organic way with each other and with readers. And the more you mediate this \u2013 the more you try and filter that through a set of pre-scripted things or preconditions \u2013 the less it\u2019s fulfilling the brief of what you want a good live literary event to be.\u201d Perth festival\u2019s statement underlined that its plan was to encourage, not limit, lively and free discussion, \u201cin a mutual spirit of safety, inclusivity, respect and courtesy\u201d. \u201cOur intention, as always, is to equip artists with the most comfortable circumstances possible to be themselves.\u201d Talks festivals need to strike a balance \u201cbetween tone policing and content policing\u201d, Williams says \u2013 and the increasingly complicated role played by organisational boards should not be underestimated either. \u201cCultural boards now have lots of pressures on them from sponsors and donors and participants alike, and they\u2019re trying to achieve that balance,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an invidious task.\u201d Perth writers\u2019 weekend runs until Sunday 25 February.

I am not proud of this. It is a little bit embarrassing, probably. But I share it to give you an idea of how obsessed I am with earrings. I often leave the house with no makeup on, but never without earrings (although it occasionally happens by mistake). The other morning, a ring of the doorbell knocked my getting ready off stride, and by the time I realised I was earring-less I was almost at the tube station, too late to turn back. I felt like I\u2019d gone to work in my slippers. I don\u2019t for a minute suggest you join me in my weapons-grade earring fixation. Think of it like this: I compulsively overthink earrings so that you don\u2019t have to. And as a result, I can today bring you a download of where we are at with earrings: which style, which colour, how many, matched or mismatched. The most important thing you need to know right now is: earrings should be definite, not dangly. They can be a chunk or they can be a sliver, but they should be solid. Chandelier earrings, all their tinkle and flutter, are not where we are at. What you want is a confident, glamazon earring. Think back to the kind of earrings Samantha wore in early episodes of Sex and the City. They were nuggets of gold, with the chunky energy of a man\u2019s signet ring, gleaming at her lobes as she eyed up her prey over a cosmo. That\u2019s what we\u2019re after. Not necessarily gold, though. After years of the yellow stuff being the only metal in town, silver is seriously cool again. And I\u2019m not loving rose gold as much as I once did. Also, a rule that I stuck to religiously until recently \u2013 that mixing silver and gold was as much of a faux pas as wearing odd socks \u2013 has fallen away. Silver and gold look good together now. Pearls are still the jewel to beat, although they look best when they are classic with a twist. Look for wonky pebble-shaped rather than perfect little globes. Less Queen Elizabeth II, more Vivienne Westwood, god rest their souls. On the subject of queens, next on the agenda is mismatched earrings. What you need to know on this topic is that Queen Camilla is now wearing them. So, yup, mismatched is still a thing, but no longer one that\u2019s winning you edgy style points. The total number of earrings matters more and, right now, two is a bit vanilla. An extra piercing or two in each ear is a quick, effective and relatively painless update. I have three piercings in one ear, and am planning to add a second to the solo one on the other lobe. A non-matching number of piercings works best, for some reason. Make sure to get your extra piercings on your best side (everyone has one, just take some selfies from different angles if you don\u2019t believe me) as they will draw attention to that view of your face. One of my favourite combinations is to wear a line of three matching chunky drops in one ear, and something different on the other side. Back to that desert island. Which earrings would I take? Tough call, but I would probably land on a gold hoop. I\u2019ve been wearing them since I was a teenager and haven\u2019t tired of them yet, so I am pretty confident they\u2019d keep me cheerful however long it would take for my ship to come. Even better, hoops are practical for an active life \u2013 you can lie on your side in comfort and they don\u2019t tend to snag on your clothes, which is useful, because it means I don\u2019t have to take them off for pilates or worry about losing them in the changing room. So I would be able to sunbathe with my trusty desert-island Complete Works of Shakespeare without a metal post digging into my skull, and they would be less likely to get dislodged if I had to take my sweater off to flag down a passing boat. Look, I don\u2019t recommend you think about earrings as much as I do. But maybe give your lobes a once-over? For me. Model: Charlotte Robinson at Milk. Styling assistant: Sam Deaman.

(Daily Mail) | Apple Podcasts The Rise and Rise of the Microchip (BBC Radio 4) | BBC Sounds Capital Breakfast | Global Player Here\u2019s an odd coincidence: two new high-profile shows based around below-the-line comments. You know the sort of stuff: reviews of a product, disgruntled or otherwise; top-of-the-head thoughts of people who\u2019ve skim-read an article; the sentimental rambles found under 1990s YouTube rave videos. Finally, they\u2019re useful! On Radio 4 on Monday, in the ever-tricky 6.30pm comedy slot, we find One Person Found This Helpful, a panel show hosted by the nonstop funny machine that is Frank Skinner. He is a uniquely listenable audio presence. His Absolute weekend show (with Emily Dean and Alun Cochrane as his foils) is consistently hilarious, yet he doesn\u2019t do much more than tell listeners what he\u2019s been up to over the previous few days. The other week, he spent a lot of time chatting about his gigs. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to take the dog to the next one. She\u2019ll be by the side of the stage. I hope she\u2019s not frightened by laughter. Or she may die.\u201d Rubbish written down, but it\u2019s the way he tells \u2019em. In OPFTH, Skinner is as super-relaxed and witty as always. The idea behind the show, devised by panel member Simon Evans and writer Jason Hazeley, is that the guests guess what\u2019s being discussed from the online reviews Skinner reads out. It\u2019s all good clean fun, plus the panellists (Evans, Jessica Fostekew, Amy Gledhill, Ahir Shah) seem to enjoy themselves, which is about 90% of any panel show\u2019s appeal. Reviews were read out for household items (one, which sounded saucy, turned out to be a spatula), as well as novels and films. Another round had the panellists giving a funny response to a Tripadvisor slating, before Skinner gave us the real response. One of these, where a customer had slagged off the size of the pizza they were served, was: \u201cHello, Jean. We are an animal rehoming centre and do not serve pizzas.\u201d Genuinely funny and entertaining, One Person Found This Helpful may actually be a panel show that lasts. And so to\u2026 the Daily Mail. Not usually where I look for podcast fun: the newspaper\u2019s most popular podcast offerings are all along the lines of its blow-by-blow account of the Lucy Letby trial. There\u2019s a similar show about the trial of Brianna Ghey\u2019s murderers, as well as the trial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, which is still going on. Absolutely not my podcast cup of tea; I\u2019m far too easily upset. But! Here comes a more enticing offer: Straight to the Comments! YouTube pranking stars Josh (Pieters) &amp; Archie (Manners) \u2013 a South African and a posh English guy \u2013 interview a celebrity using the Daily Mail\u2019s online comments as a jump-off point. So Josh reads out a comment about the celebrity, and the celebrity involved, along with Archie, has to guess what the comments are about \u2013 what they were doing or saying or appearing in. For the first show, the celebrity was 2018 Love Island winner Dani Dyer. Having read plenty of the Mail\u2019s below-the-lines rantings in my time, I imagine it took producers a while to find anything that could actually be read out about Dyer. Mail commentators don\u2019t tend to like pretty, perky, working-class women. Not that Dyer would care. She\u2019s resilient, quick-witted and sweet, as well as able to take the mickey out of herself; the perfect first guest. I could have done without Archie having to guess who she was from the comments before she arrived (and surely listeners will already know, just from the title information), but once that was done the show lickety-splitted along with plenty of laughs and upbeat revelations. You could make a (slightly tortured) connection with these series to The Rise and Rise of the Microchip, Misha Glenny\u2019s new documentary series on Radio 4. Who would have thought that the microchip would lead to us all being so interconnected that we can leave reviews of people\u2019s actual lives? To be honest, Glenny might have. He\u2019s so clever, and communicates with such ease and clarity that you too feel clever just listening to him. In The Rise and Rise\u2026 he dances through the history of the microchip and explains a different international interconnection: an iPhone is \u201ccreated in the US, with a chip designed in the UK, manufactured in Taiwan and assembled in China\u201d. There are so many amazing facts here, just casually mentioned: nearly all microchips are made in Taiwan, so an escalation of its government\u2019s conflict with China would \u201cdefault globally\u201d, says an expert \u201cwith a much greater impact than Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine\u201d. Fantastically interesting stuff, beautifully delivered. Much hoo-ha about Jordan North leaving Radio 1 to front the Capital Breakfast show from April. It\u2019s a high-profile gig; he follows in the footsteps of Roman Kemp, who has been an excellent main host for the past 10 years. But North has actually worked at Capital before, in the north-east and Manchester. Obviously there\u2019s always fuss when Global poaches BBC stars (Chris Stark, who\u2019s on Capital Breakfast, was Scott Mills\u2019s sidekick for many years), but it should be remembered that the BBC has often snapped up commercial music presenters too. Vick Hope, North\u2019s co-host at Radio 1 in the teatime slot, used to be on Capital Breakfast herself, from 2017 to 2020. Though I\u2019ve no doubt North will be excellent, he\u2019s protected from any failure by the enormous success of his podcast Help, I Sexted My Boss, which he hosts with William Hanson. Help\u2026 is made by Audio Always, an indie production company. Perhaps such a show sits more easily alongside hosting on a commercial station rather than the BBC? Either way, the warm and jovial North is flying right now, and Capital must be very happy to have landed him.", "date": "2024-02-24", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Miranda Sawyer", "id": 454, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/60f467d59f97db7b46fb3f23b552a109d14f0aec/0_299_2560_1536/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Michael Donkor: \u2018Representation feels more nuanced to me now\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/24/michael-donkor-representation-feels-more-nuanced-to-me-now-novel-grow-where-they-fall", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.033, "neu": 0.69, "pos": 0.277, "compound": 0.9991}, "body": "Michael Donkor, 39, was born in London to Ghanaian parents. His first novel, Hold (2018), about three teenage girls, was listed for the Dylan Thomas prize and the Desmond Elliott prize. His second, Grow Where They Fall, follows Kwame, a secondary school teacher, which was Donkor\u2019s own job until his recent move to Lisbon, where he now works as a bookseller. Where did this book begin? I\u2019d had some experiences \u2013 some challenging, some comic \u2013 of being in incredibly white environments, and I wondered whether a novel might be a place to think through those experiences. It wasn\u2019t that after publishing Hold I just woke up and was like, OK, now I\u2019m going to write the book about me. Nothing Kwame goes through specifically happened to me. He\u2019s more someone I wished I\u2019d had around in those racially vexed moments when I felt uncertain about what was going on in a room. I thought of him as the person I wanted to see when the headteacher was in the staff room saying: \u201cOh, we need to do more stuff about Black history,\u201d and I could sense people looking at me. I\u2019d desperately wanted someone to lock eyes with and be like, \u201cThis is weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Did your work as a teacher give you a fund of material for fiction? Making Kwame a teacher felt a slight risk because I worried I wouldn\u2019t know how to use my knowledge in a way that wasn\u2019t just me writing polemic: \u201cI\u2019ve been teaching for over a decade at three different places, let me tell you what I know\u2026\u201d I could write another two whole novels about that! I was keen to show the ordinariness of the exchanges between Kwame and his students. In the political conversation about education, there\u2019s little attention paid to the real human work \u2013 what it costs for a person to wake up at 6am and finish at 8pm after marking and to have more than 100 conversations every single day. What led you to the book\u2019s matter-of-fact candour about gay sex? Sometimes in queer novels there\u2019s a titillating quality; I wanted the sex to feel sexy but I didn\u2019t want people rubbing their thighs. Did I sense my teacherly responsibilities or the attitudes I suppose my students might have reading a novel where Mr Donkor\u2019s written about willies and cum and stuff? I don\u2019t know how I managed this, but honestly, when I sit down to write, I forget everyone else: it\u2019s just me, the characters and the 500 words I\u2019ve set myself to tackle. In writing a big social novel full of dialogue, did you feel like you were working against the trend for more interior, fragmentary novels? I really admire Deborah Levy and Rachel Cusk but much as I enjoy flintier stuff, I also enjoy a good yarn: the sort of novel where you think, I\u2019m going to be held in a close embrace for 400 pages in a world that is very fully described. I really like novels where there\u2019s a sense of the narrator being conversational. That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re necessarily in slang or dialect \u2013 it\u2019s about creating a voice that is inviting and feels like someone is speaking the novel to you. When I\u2019m writing I read my work aloud a lot; I want it to sound as if you\u2019re mid-conversation rather than something distant and arch. Name a novel you\u2019ve enjoyed recently. Something I\u2019ve been recommending in the bookshop where I work is Constance Debr\u00e9\u2019s Love Me Tender. I love its gutsiness: how she can be the sort of mother she wants to be, and how she can mother herself as she goes through this transitional moment of fully embracing her queerness, were questions I found really compelling. And the sex was fun and direct: \u201cNo need to be nervous but, yes, I\u2019m going to talk about my dildo now.\u201d I also loved Vladimir [by Julia May Jonas], for its wildly unpredictable over-the-topness and astute understanding of the negotiations involved in long-term relationships. How come you left London for Lisbon? It was a post-pandemic, let\u2019s-do-something-adventurous decision. We came in July 2022. My husband and I got married here six years ago and we know the city quite well. People ask me: \u201cIs it really creatively inspiring? Are its colours making you think in new ways?\u201d I\u2019m like, I dunno; so far I only know what it\u2019s like to edit a novel here! Among the English-language community there\u2019s definitely a developing creative writing scene. There\u2019s this huge influx of British and American people and lots of them have creative ambitions. People from San Francisco and Stoke Newington tell me they\u2019re in the middle of writing their Lisbon novel. So I would not be surprised if there\u2019s a new kind of genre in the next five years, the Lisbon expat novel \u2013 it\u2019s coming, I think. Tell us about a novel you remember reading as a child. I was about 11 the first time I read a novel about Ghana: Comfort Herself, by Geraldine Kaye, who was actually a white woman. It\u2019s about a British-Ghanaian girl in Ghana for the first time. She doesn\u2019t like the food, she\u2019s confused about the values of the place and thinks her grandmother\u2019s really harsh; then her relationship with this place that she\u2019s from, but didn\u2019t feel like she was from, develops and softens. I experienced the thrill of reading something and thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve been there, it is like that!\u201d As I\u2019ve gotten older, that magic of representation has a slightly different quality. The question of representation feels more nuanced for me now \u2013 it needs to be more than: \u201cLet\u2019s write a documentary-type novel about what it means to be Black.\u201d I want more specificity: to say something new or different to make us reconsider what we think we know about Black experience.

Ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary, she has worked to get out the vote in South Carolina, where Haley is bracing for a loss to Donald Trump in the state that twice elected her governor. But some of her supporters are vowing to stick with their candidate until the end. Haley is Trump\u2019s last remaining primary rival. Casting herself as David taking on Goliath, she has refused to drop out of the race, thrilling voters like Tripp who say they no longer feel welcome in Trump\u2019s Republican party. \u201cNikki represents an opportunity for us to finally speak,\u201d Tripp said. On a Beast of the South-East bus tour across her \u201csweet\u201d South Carolina, Haley was often greeted by crowds of women and girls eager to see her make history. But also \u2013 and more importantly, they emphasize \u2013 she would restore a sense of normalcy to American politics. \u201cShe\u2019s not the best woman for the job.

South Carolina primary: read more When to expect South Carolina results Key dates for the 2024 election Who\u2019s running for president? Haley\u2019s steep odds in South Carolina Those like Smith who recall Haley\u2019s tenure as governor point to her stewardship of the state\u2019s economy and her leadership in the wake of the racist massacre at the historically Black Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015. Others cite her foreign policy experience as United Nations ambassador under Trump. But a not insignificant source of her support is her opponent. \u201cTo be honest, I hate Trump,\u201d said Barbara Bates, 76, of Goose Creek, when asked about her support for Haley. Bates \u2013 a Republican who voted for Haley as governor, and who was wearing a Haley campaign shirt that quipped \u201cunderestimate me, that will be fun\u201d \u2013 said she was under no illusion that Trump could be stopped from winning the nomination. She nevertheless believed it was important for Haley to stand in his way as he attempts to stamp out any strain of resistance to his nomination. \u201cI appreciate her hanging in and not dropping out,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIn 2020 I didn\u2019t get a vote in the presidential primary because South Carolina went ahead and anointed Trump. At least she gave me a vote.\u201d With most of the Republican base in Trump\u2019s thrall, Haley\u2019s coalition is a hodgepodge of conservatives who remember her as the \u201cTea Party governor\u201d, and anti-Trump Republicans and independents disillusioned by the prospect of a November rematch between Trump, a 77-year-old former president facing 91 felony charges, and Joe Biden, the deeply unpopular incumbent. She also appeals to some Democrats fearful of a Trump second term and indifferent toward Biden. South Carolina is among the states that allow registered Democrats to vote in the Republican primary \u2013 as long as they didn\u2019t participate in their party\u2019s contest earlier this month. At an event in Georgetown this week, Morgan Derrick, a self-described \u201ccurious Democrat\u201d, said she liked Haley\u2019s foreign policy approach and her economic plans. But she has concerns with Haley\u2019s conservative views on abortion. Derrick said abortion was \u201cprobably the highest policy on my mind\u201d though she had disagreements with Biden on other issues, leaving her unsure of how she would vote. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated field out there,\u201d Derrick said. A Suffolk University/USA Today poll of South Carolina Republican primary voters found that 59% of respondents who identified themselves as liberals or moderates said they\u2019d vote for the former South Carolina governor, compared with just 38% who said they would back Trump. Among those who said the most important issue of the future is democracy, 63% favored Haley. Not all of Haley\u2019s supporters are anti-Trump. Some are enthusiastically pro-Haley. A group of Republican women cheered wildly and danced in the crowd as they waited for Haley\u2019s bus to arrive in Moncks Corner. Some wore shirts that said \u201cbarred permanently\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump\u2019s threat to ex-communicate any donor who continued giving to her campaign. Several of those same supporters arrived at Haley\u2019s evening event wearing feather boas and \u201cwomen for Nikki\u201d pins. They praised her as a \u201crole model\u201d and a \u201cleader\u201d who was \u201csmart as a whip\u201d and could unify the country. When she finishes speaking, Haley is regularly mobbed by women and young girls, who often receive extra attention from the candidate. She autographs their posters with a heart and a personalized note and poses for selfies. \u201cShe seems like a voice for the future,\u201d said Trish Mooney, 60, who attended a Haley event in Georgetown this week. Haley has also attracted a loyal group of out-of-state volunteers, some who have followed her campaign from Iowa. A Massachusetts man handing out yard signs in Moncks Corner said he felt compelled to do what he could to defeat Trump. Marti Leib, an independent who said she never votes a straight party-line ticket, came from Florida with her tiny dog, Kipper, to support Haley\u2019s campaign in the state. In a view shared by several attendees at the candidate\u2019s Friday campaign stops, Leib said the November election presents an existential choice for Americans \u2013 and that Haley is the only candidate left in the race who can save the country. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something right this election season, we\u2019re gonna fall like the Roman empire,\u201d said Leib, 73. \u201cIt\u2019s downright scary.\u201d Despite Haley\u2019s dwindling odds, some of her most loyal supporters aren\u2019t ready to confront the question of who they will vote for in November if \u2013 but if they\u2019re honest, when \u2013 she drops out of the race. \u201cThat\u2019s like choosing between a hedgehog and a porcupine,\u201d said Smith.

For Giorgio Armani, it is about joy and renewal, he said. Armani, who launched his eponymous brand in 1975, has had time and experience to consider the role fashion can play in these circumstances. \u201cThis is a question I am often asked and I myself wonder what the role of fashion is in such difficult times,\u201d he told the Guardian before his Milan fashion week show on Sunday morning. \u201cFor me, what fashion can do is convey a sense of renewal, but also joy. We aren\u2019t changing the world, nor can we solve the world\u2019s problems, but we can give people a moment of lightness, the feeling of being different, new and even more beautiful. These are small pleasures, but sometimes small things can make a big difference.\u201d It is a sentiment other big names in Milan have expressed over the course of this week. At a preview for her show on Friday, Donatella Versace told the press: \u201cClothes don\u2019t give you all the strength, but some of it,\u201d while Miuccia Prada said the starting point for her collection with her co-creative director, Raf Simons, was \u201can instinctive need for love and goodness \u2026 especially in a time like this\u201d. For his autumn/winter 2024 collection, Armani said he was inspired by winter flowers as a representation of hope. \u201cA flower blooming in the cold is a symbol of rebirth, which is what I would like to communicate at this time,\u201d he said. Blooms arrived embroidered on fedoras, as 3D sequined embellishments, and appliqu\u00e9d as wild flowers climbing towards the waist from the hem of full tulle skirts that represented \u201cthe power and energy of nature and the lifecycle of our planet\u201d. Opening the show was the top model Gina Di Bernardo, who was frequently photographed for Armani in the 1980s by Aldo Fallai and whom the designer said \u201cembodies this message\u201d. Elsewhere, the grand finale of red-carpet-ready glitz that Armani is famed for came in emerald-green bandeau gowns, velvet blazer suits, and beaded corsets, as brand ambassadors Cate Blanchett and Aaron Taylor-Johnson watched from the front row. \u201cSeeing my clothes on the red carpet still excites and inspires me without a doubt,\u201d said the designer. \u201cI may follow the award season with less trepidation than in the past, but it remains an important moment for me.\u201d Armani, who will turn 90 in July, said he intended to continue business as usual for the foreseeable future. \u201cThis will be a particularly important birthday for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is cause to reflect, of course, but with one eye focused on the future and a proactive and creative mindset.

Lewis is now back on air for the ABC \u2013 as the host of Double J Mornings, where he\u2019s again tasked with playing the best new music (and some older hits as well).

Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning It\u2019s the guitar on which Quinn taught me Wish You Were Here. Every time I play it, I wish he was here. I think of his beautiful artist\u2019s hands on the fretboard and his nicotine-stained fingers strumming away effortlessly on the strings. And that makes me happy. I can feel the history in the wood. I can hear the stories in the strings. I can see the shape of his fingers when I look at mine \u2013 making shapes to make music. My brother is the reason I\u2019m into music and have made it my life and my career. The guitar is my greatest connection to him. I especially love when my kids play it. They never got to know their uncle since he passed away before they were born \u2013 but I feel like there\u2019s a bit of a magic connection when they play Uncle Q\u2019s guitar. My most useful object Slides. That sounds silly. But I\u2019ve thought about it long and hard and can\u2019t think of a better answer! I mean those slipper things normally reserved for the pool shower so you don\u2019t get tinea. Like the boxer shorts of thongs. Slides \u2026 but with socks. Always with socks. If you know, you know. When I first slid into slides in 2018 I thought it was funny. Then I realised it\u2019s not just funny. It feels safe. It feels secure. It\u2019s naughty. It\u2019s like a gentle embrace for your foot from a friend\u2019s hot mum. Soon after I saw some youths \u2013 like pre-eshays \u2013 wearing socks and slides in a rural shopping centre. As soon as I saw them, I realised this was not just some funny comfort. This was a farshun. I could rock this shiznay out and about in public \u2013 like a rock star. As soon as the pre-eshay youths were far enough away to not see an old man copy their style, I popped into the nearest surf shop and got myself some red slides and black socks. Sick combo. Since 2018 I\u2019ve requested Kenzo slides for every birthday, Father\u2019s Day and Christmas, and no one thinks I\u2019m being serious. I am. The item I most regret losing A gold Machine Man I won in the 80s. I used to collect Machine Men. They were like Transformers, but less successful. They were better quality than Transformers (not many loose bits that could be lost) and a better design (more metal). But somehow Transformers lasted and Machine Men didn\u2019t. The pie\u0300ce de re\u0301sistance in my collection was a gold Porsche Machine Man. The only way to get one was to win it, and this was in the pre-internet days of the mid-80s. I had to collect a bunch of barcodes from the toy packaging and send them to Japan. And I won. It was the greatest feeling ever: I possessed a rare Machine Man! I took it carefully through my childhood, always putting it on display. And I took it carefully through every sharehouse I lived in and every house we\u2019ve owned (someone\u2019s doing well). And then one day it was gone. Along with all my Machine Men, except one. I don\u2019t know if they were left in a removal van or accidentally chucked out with some boxes or taken by faeries? But I reckon I think about my gold Porsche every day. And I still hold out hope for his return some day.

I was seven, eight? And the headteacher was talking about what makes a book. I guess it must have been around whatever passed for World Book Day back then. No Harry Potter costumes for us in those days, no Elsa-from-Frozen (because-we-have-the-activity-book-actually), no, these were the days when we would take it in turns to read from the papyrus scroll, perhaps in a little pretend Shakespeare beard if our mums remembered to pluck the goat the night before. But I remember Mr Bainbridge\u2019s assembly as revelatory and sort of beautiful. He talked about the way imagination could blossom, then be corralled into words, and how these words could be lined up on a printing block, and there was something, I think, about growing a tree for its paper, and then, how this story was bound and protected by its cover, and how each of these little folders were impossibly precious. He inspired in me, back then, a kind of reverence for books. But lord, my admiration is nothing compared to the dislocated, swooning awe for the book as object that exists today. \u201cBookshelf wealth\u201d has been named 2024\u2019s \u201cfirst major design trend\u201d. This is the new name for a home stacked with hundreds of carefully curated books and it is situated as the interior design version of fashion\u2019s \u201cquiet luxury\u201d. Quiet luxury, you\u2019ll remember, is the trend for normal people (us) trying to dress like the super-wealthy (them) and spending the equivalent of a car on a cardigan that we believe will help us pass as rich and give us access to a world that would otherwise treat us with disdain. In this context, books are valuable, but not for their ability to titillate, terrify, educate, no none of that \u2013 they are valuable for the way their presence communicates a particular kind of educated class. Today, any discussion of book ownership will spark great wars. Whole identities are founded on the thing, it being more acceptable, in this climate, to post online the pile of books one has read this month than to walk through town singing, \u201cI\u2019m a very clever boy.\u201d And this interiors trend is no different, with sides having rapidly formed. There are the lifestyle girlies, who appreciate the cosy aesthetic, and then there\u2019s everyone else, some of whom have gone quite mad: the New York Times quotes one disgusted critic saying, \u201cThe day I \u2018cultivate\u2019 books instead of buying what I like to read is the day I\u2019ll know I\u2019ve truly failed as a human.\u201d I take no sides. Not me, not old Eva! But I do find it interesting that so many care so much. Care that some ladies on TikTok are besmirching their precious lit-er-a-ture by pointing out that a shelf of books adds colour and texture to a room, rather than, as is presumably correct, critiquing the prose inside them in a series of online essays? But both the fors and the againsts (the againsts being self-identified \u201creaders\u201d) share a reverence for books as objects that must be fought for and displayed, that act as identity markers, and signifiers for rich inner lives. Do the againsts resent the fors, for saying their quiet bits out loud? For acknowledging that a book is more than just the sum of its parts? To me, the success of this trend says less about books today, which have been used as a kind of intellectual set-dressing for centuries; as long as books have existed, there has been a sad-eyed man or glamorous woman carrying one as an accessory to convey soul and status. It says, I think, more about a reality of deep insecurity, both in the rabid reaction from readers, who feel their identities are threatened by the use of books as design, and in the popularity of the trend itself. The bookshelves full of novels don\u2019t just point at an interior life lived richly, but at a way of living, in the kind of home where you won\u2019t be evicted because the landlord wants to paint the bathroom and double the rent. These are shelves that speak of a kind of permanence: those drawn towards this aesthetic don\u2019t just want to be seen as people who can read (decorators have long bought old books by the metre), but as people who have had the time and wealth to slowly build a home, full of things that have helped shape who they have gradually become. Like quiet luxury, which worked to defang its fans and exposed our kinky relationship with the super rich, the appeal of bookshelf wealth and its ensuing outrage tells us something uncomfortable about our culture. About the upsettingly humble aspiration \u2013 to live safely among our precious stories \u2013 that led to its virality as a trend, in the power we place in books, how they signify class, and in the bitter ways we find ourselves when in opposition to others who, in this case, \u201cget books wrong\u201d.

He pulls on his overalls, takes a can of coffee from a street vending machine and sets out in his modest little van to start work, diligently cleaning the public toilets of Tokyo. It\u2019s a solitary life. Hirayama can go days saying no more than a few cursory words. If members of the public notice him, they largely view him as an inconvenience. But mostly they don\u2019t even see him. It should be the most soul-crushingly bleak film ever made \u2013 a Groundhog Day grind with added despair and urinal cakes. But Wim Wenders\u2019s zen meditation on beauty, fulfilment and simplicity is quite the opposite: it\u2019s an achingly lovely and unexpectedly life-affirming picture. It all depends \u2013 and this is central to the film\u2019s gently profound message \u2013 on your way of looking at things. Hirayama looks at the world with his eyes, but sees with his heart. There is a Japanese word, \u201ckomorebi\u201d, which was the original title of the film. Literally translated, it means \u201csunlight leaking through trees\u201d, but there\u2019s more to it than that. It speaks of a profound connection with nature, and the necessity to pause, to take the time to absorb and appreciate the perfection of tiny, seemingly insignificant details. Hirayama has not only grasped all of this, he has made it the keystone of his essence. He sees all things, all people, as equally important, with an equal capacity for transcendence. While other pedestrians ignore the vagrant who camps in a park, Hirayama watches in wonder as the man moves in his own dance of self-expression. And the toilets themselves, although humble in purpose, are architectural gems. Hirayama\u2019s ascetic existence is stripped back to basics: music, played on cassette tapes collected, we assume, in his long-ago youth; secondhand books bought from the budget section of the local bookstore; a point-and-shoot film camera with which he captures the things that please him; the interplay between the sky and the trees. Trees, it seems, have a particular significance for Hirayama, something that he pays back by carefully rescuing fragile Japanese maple seedlings in order to nurture them in his apartment. That this way of living lightly in the world seems as spiritually rewarding as it does is largely thanks to Yakusho\u2019s remarkable performance. The actor, whose previous films include Memoirs of a Geisha, Eureka and Babel, can convey an extraordinarily rich interior life, almost entirely without leaning on dialogue. Equally important in our understanding of Hirayama\u2019s journey through the world is the choice of music. He listens to 60s and 70s American and British rock \u2013 the Velvet Underground, the Kinks, Otis Redding, Patti Smith \u2013 and Japanese folk from the same period. The song choices \u2013 in particular the Lou Reed track that gives the film its title and Nina Simone\u2019s Feeling Good \u2013 are windows into his soul at any given moment. Hirayama has found harmony, although there are suggestions of a previous, more privileged life, in which this was not the case. This sense of peace and equanimity is a rare thing in the central character of a film \u2013 cinema, after all, thrives on conflict and discord. They don\u2019t call it drama for nothing. Perfect Days is, by no small margin, Wenders\u2019s most successful narrative film in a long time. With its gentle rhythms, leisurely pacing and quiet profundity, this Tokyo toilet story has an obvious debt to the work of Yasujir\u014d Ozu. But it also put me in mind of Federico Veiroj\u2019s slow cinema gem A Useful Life, and of Wenders\u2019s own masterpiece Wings of Desire. Hirayama might not be an angel, but there\u2019s something elevated about his quiet joy in the world around him. It\u2019s possible that Perfect Days \u2013 Oscar-nominated for best international feature \u2013 is as much a manifesto as it is a movie \u2013 an argument in favour of an alternative way of being. Perfection, the film argues, is found in a pared-down approach to the world and a rejection of the thirst for new sensations and novelty that drives so much of society. It\u2019s no accident that Hirayama favours analogue technology over digital \u2013 the cassette tapes, the film camera. The digital onslaught, with its noise and distractions, is in direct opposition to the spiritual peace and purity that he works towards each day. Perhaps, in its polite and unassuming way, the film advocates not just a new way of looking, but also a new way of living.", "date": "2024-02-25", "section": "Film", "author": "Wendy Ide", "id": 461, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/72d2c7fc783aeb032543737be2da3f9c6f2af6b9/0_84_4096_2457/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Ghetts: On Purpose, With Purpose review \u2013 brimming with elegant fury", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/feb/25/ghetts-on-purpose-with-purpose-review", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.088, "neu": 0.541, "pos": 0.371, "compound": 0.9927}, "body": "Remarkably, rappers who were teens when grime went national are now turning 40.

When his twin siblings requested a saw for their second birthday, I realised I\u2019d crossed the Rubicon: I\u2019d become an accidental mother of Vikings. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. I relocated from London to Denmark, carefree and childless, but despite planning on staying just a year I\u2019m still here a decade and three children later. So I have skin in the Viking game. And Nordic children do things differently. They eat differently, learn differently, play, dress, even sleep differently \u2013 with babies left to nap outside in their prams in sub-zero temperatures. They sing, fight, climb, fall and get up again. They are out in nature for hours a day \u2013 despite the fact that the weather\u2019s terrible (we\u2019re talking Mordor from October to March). Nordics seldom come across as happy-go-lucky \u2013 preferring \u201cscheduled fun\u201d to anything approaching spontaneity. And yet\u2026 Nordic countries regularly top Unicef rankings in terms of happiness, education and equality with the highest rates of wellbeing, globally. Some aspects of their parenting can be applied wherever you are, while others can act as inspiration. So here are a few things I\u2019ve learned about how to raise a Viking. 1. Every day in every way, play Play is so big in the Nordic countries, they named it twice. The verb forms of \u201cplay\u201d in Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Icelandic and Norwegian refer specifically to enjoyable, unstructured and intrinsically motivated activities. But if you\u2019re playing sport, a board game, or a musical instrument, you use spille in Danish and Norwegian, spela in Swedish, spila in Icelandic and pelata in Finnish. Professor Ellen Beate Hansen Sandseter at Queen Maud University College Norway says: \u201cStudies following children from birth show that it\u2019s not the ones who climb a tree, fall and break a leg who have a fear of heights \u2013 it\u2019s the ones who never climbed a tree.\u201d Playfighting is another important part of a child\u2019s development, teaching cooperation, confidence and appropriate judgment. \u201cYou have to let kids fight sometimes,\u201d one Danish mum tells me. They need \u201cto have conflict, to see if they can solve it and get themselves to the peace table\u201d. Terrifying in the short term, helpful in the long run (or so I\u2019m told). 2. Teach children how to think not what to think Vikings don\u2019t start school until six years old (seven in Finland). They\u2019re eased in with short days, no grades, tests or homework until around age 11. Sabilah Eboo Alwani from the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge thinks this is a good thing, since: \u201cthe early onset of lots of homework erodes quality time from a developmental point of view.\u201d The Danish system is based on teaching according to interests and, \u201cThey\u2019re taught to think \u2013 not just pass exams,\u201d says teacher Louise Lingaard. Children learn to stand up for themselves, with public speaking part of the school routine from six, while reading comes later \u2013 around eight. By the age of 15, Nordic countries rank above the OECD average, with Finland ahead of the UK and the US overall. The lesson here, regardless of different schooling systems, is to let a child develop their own interests and read at their own pace. Research shows that putting pressure on children to read too early causes stress and later readers easily catch up with, and even surpass, early ones. 3. There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather Nordics of all nationalities have variations on this mantra and studies show that spending time outdoors improves cooperation, reduces stress, helps with concentration and evens out differences between low-achieving and high-achieving children. And yet, three-quarters of UK children spend less time outside than prison inmates. In Norway, friluftsliv \u2013 or \u201cfree air life\u201d \u2013 is akin to a secular religion and many Swedes attend Saturday \u201cnature school\u201d. From childhood, Nordics develop what Stanford University social psychologist Kari Leibowitz calls a \u201cpositive wintertime mindset\u201d. Learning to dress the part is key. \u201cIn much of the world when it\u2019s cold, people still dress normally to go out, then wonder why they\u2019re uncomfortable,\u201d says Leibowitz. My children now own snowsuits, rainsuits, \u201cwindsuits\u201d, balaclavas, thermal underwear, gloves, waterproof mitten \u201cshells\u201d, snow boots and rain boots. Develop a positive mindset by wearing more winter-friendly clothes and remember, there\u2019s no such thing as the wrong weather, only the wrong clothing. 4. Not every picture needs to go on the fridge While many cultures adopt the idea that constant praise enhances the development of self-esteem (\u201cWho\u2019s my CLEVER BOY! That\u2019s the BEST poo EVER!\u201d), Danes don\u2019t. Vikings believe that over-praise leads to inflated egos and a poor sense of self. This instils the idea that everyone is worthy, just because. \u201cWhen kids say, \u2018Look at this!\u2019 it\u2019s their way of requesting our attention,\u201d says Danish family therapist Sofie M\u00fcnster. \u201cThey\u2019re not actually asking for praise. So it\u2019s better to teach them to evaluate things for themselves, otherwise they\u2019ll spend their lives looking for external validation.\u201d As one friend put it: \u201cI would never know if my parents thought something I\u2019d done was good, but also, it wasn\u2019t important. I assumed they loved me. It was taken for granted, not based on achievement.\u201d Danes replace praise with interest and ask \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d or \u201cTell me more.\u201d \u201cThis shows children that we care about them \u2013 not their \u2018results\u2019,\u201d says M\u00fcnster. As well as less positive praise, there tends to be less negative judgment, too. When toddlers discover their autonomy in English-speaking countries, they\u2019re categorised as in the \u201cterrible twos\u201d. But in Danish, this is known as \u201cthe boundary age\u201d since pushing boundaries is normal \u2013 not \u201cterrible\u201d. 5. Singing together is good for society Danes love to sing and many schools still have group singing every morning, proven to release the bonding hormone oxytocin, which lowers stress, while the synchronicity of breathing together creates feelings of connectedness. Researchers from Aarhus University found that singing strengthens feelings of community and social cohesion. During the pandemic, Danish choirmaster Phillip Faber led daily singalongs on the Danish equivalent of the BBC to boost morale. \u201cMany confuse \u2018group singing\u2019 with \u2018beautiful-sounding choirs\u2019,\u201d says Faber, \u201cbut it\u2019s the experience rather than the outcome that matters. In a world where everything is \u2018me me me\u2019, singing together is like a starry night. You feel small and insignificant, but also not alone and as though you belong. It\u2019s the best feeling in the world.\u201d Disappearing into group singing is the perfect communal pursuit for the nation that brought us Jante\u2019s Law \u2013 a set of attitudes said to govern Danish life where everyone is equal and showing off is frowned upon. It doesn\u2019t have to sound good \u2013 it just has to feel good. 6. Family meals are sacred The idea of sitting down and eating as a family is highly valued in Nordic society. Even a CEO is allowed to say in a meeting at 4pm, \u201cI have to leave now to pick up the kids.\u201d And then go home, to eat as a family. Most Danish homes are centred around a dining table for the express purpose of prioritising family mealtimes. Wherever you live, there are still real benefits in aiming for a homemade family meal once a week to reconnect. If you can cook from scratch even better, but bear in mind it\u2019s less about what you eat for dinner and more about who you eat it with. 7. Accept that family comes in many forms There are 37 different types of family unit in Denmark, while Sweden, Norway and Iceland have more births outside marriage than within it \u2013 67% of Icelandic babies are born out of wedlock. In the US and the UK, these family formations are associated with being worse off and can attract stigma, but in Nordic countries, they\u2019re embraced. Former Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin was raised by two female parents, while Denmark\u2019s prime minister Mette Frederiksen came to power as a single mother of two. No matter how a family is formed, there\u2019s a broad acceptance \u2013 and children learn this from a young age \u2013 that each family is different but equal with its own strengths and flaws\u2026 just like ours.

Rats are clever, clean and full of personality and affection. But none of mine had as much personality as Letty, the rat I found in a bin. She had clearly been someone\u2019s pet, though I never found out whose, or how she had ended up on the streets. On a visit home from university one Christmas, I went for a drink with a friend who mentioned that he had seen a black-and-white rat in a nearby bin. It took two attempts, but I caught her, trapping her in a cat carrier and driving back to my family home filled with satisfaction that was not shared by my mother. Letty was young, barely fully grown and very thin. She had painful burn marks on her back that the vet said looked as if they had been made with a cigarette. Despite that, she grew into the prettiest rat I\u2019ve ever seen. Her fur was a silky coat of black and white patches, and she stayed tiny and dainty. I named her after Letty Lade, the notorious adventuress who started life in a hovel but married into the aristocracy. Rat in carrier, I caught the train back to university in Edinburgh. Two elderly ladies sat at the same table as me and smiled at the cat box. \u201cIs it a kitten?\u201d one asked, possibly after spotting a nose snuffling at the air hole. \u201cNo,\u201d I replied, perhaps too truthfully. \u201cIt\u2019s a rat I found in a bin.\u201d The ladies changed carriage. At home, with Letty in a warm, safe cage, we began a love/hate relationship that lasted the rest of her life. I loved her and she hated me \u2013 and every human she encountered. On one occasion, she bit my finger so deeply that I swear I saw a brief flash of bone, and I bought extra-thick gardening gloves for when I had no choice but to handle her. Fortunately, she quickly formed a deep bond with the other rats. She would burrow herself into the middle of the pile when they all cuddled up to sleep and would spend hours grooming them and being groomed. Letty was a very chatty rodent, constantly chirping demands at her cagemates or grinding her teeth contentedly as they lounged together in their hammock. She lived a long life for a rat, but even in old age she managed to boss around the younger rats through the sheer force of her personality. When Letty died, I cried more than for any of my friendlier rats.

If the first duty of any parent or guardian is to provide a safe and healthy environment for their children, then showing them how to access and use the internet safely is their responsibility. Roads are also potentially dangerous for children, but we do not ban cars \u2013 instead we spend time teaching young people the safe way to navigate through busy traffic. Having an open and honest relationship, and setting clear boundaries at home, will be far more likely to help young people understand and recognise the dangers associated with an uncensored internet than the imposition of draconian blanket bans. Making social media \u201cadults only\u201d will only make it more attractive to curious and tech-savvy children. It could also make them less likely to ask for help if exposed to any disturbing content or unwanted attention. Stuart Harrington Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset \u2022 Giving children access to a smartphone can be damaging, as we have seen so tragically with Brianna Ghey and many others. However, the wider debate about the appropriateness of smartphone access needs to be seen from all perspectives. I went through school in the smartphone era, and I saw first-hand the benefits of having access to a smartphone. I used mine to download and use a smart bus ticket, to access journalism, news and weather apps, to research topics online for assignments and to communicate with my cadet group on Facebook. There are many positive uses for a smartphone, and I don\u2019t think I could have managed without one. However, more parental controls on social media and monitoring could only be a positive thing. Even in the few years since I was in education, there has been a dramatic shift in online threats, and more control for parents should be encouraged and welcomed.

Where do you live? At the moment, I\u2019m living in Bangkok. I used to live with my friend but I graduated last year so I came back to live with my parents because I didn\u2019t have enough money. Bangkok is very good if you have a lot of money; you can do everything you want. It\u2019s easy to order everything \u2013 when you\u2019re too lazy to go out you can just open your phone and order something to eat. It\u2019s hard if you don\u2019t have a lot of money because transport is so bad. I\u2019ve just got a job, but I\u2019m waiting for the company to assign me. Wherever I go it will be outside Bangkok. What do you do? When I applied [to university] I thought: \u201cI like physics, I like mathematics, right?\u201d so I got into environmental engineering. But after I studied for four years and graduated I thought \u2026 I don\u2019t like it. So I wanted to change and find a different job , so I applied to be a management trainee. It pays a good salary and it can open up more opportunities, but you need to work hard. There are good companies that pay a lot of money for environmental engineering but the competition is high. It\u2019s a field that\u2019s hard to find work in, in Thailand. I think it\u2019s good in other countries, like the US or Canada, but other countries care about environmental issues more than Thailand. What apps do you use? Line, Instagram, Shopee and Twitter/X. Thai people use Line to send messages, send pictures, to do everything. We send stickers and emojis to be polite. We might say thank you and then \u201ca bowing bear\u201d. I have a cat so I buy everything for her on Shopee. Her name is unchi \u2013 it means \u201cpoop\u201d in Japanese, but it\u2019s cute. She\u2019s two years old. What do you listen to? I listen to Taylor Swift or Shawn Mendes or Thai songs. When I listen to English songs, sometimes I can\u2019t translate \u2013 I just think, oh good song. Then I can focus on my reading or driving. What do you eat? I eat everything except vegetables and spicy food. When I go to eat with my friends, we order tom yum kung soup, fried sea bass, chicken wings and som tum [papaya salad] \u2013 but som tum is spicy so they order one plate spicy, one plate not spicy. How do you socialise? Gossiping. If I\u2019m with a close friend I will talk about something deep, something secret that I only want to tell them. When I\u2019m with groups of friends we just drink alcohol and talk \u2013 stupid things like stories from when we were young, like old people! I like to drink beer more than whisky because beer is easy to drink \u2013 just one or two bottles, you don\u2019t need to have a mixer. We go to friends\u2019 houses to talk and eat barbecue with them, and have beer. When some of my friends want to dance maybe they go to a pub and dance together. Maybe every few months we go to another province to travel \u2013 a one-day, or two-day trip. What do you wear? Just T-shirts and jeans. I used to wear black or white colours but my mom didn\u2019t like it, she wanted me to wear pink, green, every colour. In Thailand they don\u2019t like the children to wear black or white, they say \u201cit\u2019s not lively or colourful\u201d. At university almost all of the students wear Birkenstock sandals. For girls, there\u2019s a brand called Holster, it\u2019s like a trend. Tell us about your Saturday Last Saturday I went to my aunt\u2019s bungalow hotel in Nakhon Nayok, central Thailand. Ten years ago it was busy because a lot of customers stay after spotting it while driving past. But now it\u2019s hard because a lot of young people find resorts on Facebook or Google. So I helped them to open a Facebook page. How do you relax? Watching TV like a Korean series or drama. A lot of my friends love to watch Korean series and read manga on Korean comics platform Webtoon. What do you want? I want to be rich and have a lot of money. If you have money you can do everything you want to. I could go to travel around the world, but I would need to have money first. What do you fear? I am afraid of ghosts. When I was young, I read ghost stories, but then I couldn\u2019t sleep for a month. I\u2019d need to wake my dad up for him to stay with me before I go to sleep. I\u2019ve never experienced any ghosts though, I don\u2019t want to dare them. What\u2019s next? I have a plan to study for a master\u2019s degree in Taiwan so I need to take the exam and get a high enough score to get the scholarship fee. I thought about Australia, but in Taiwan it\u2019s easier to get a full scholarship. Also, in Taiwan they speak Chinese and so I will learn another language if I go there. What does the world in 2024 look like to you? 2024 is my pee chong [a bad year according to astrology] \u2013 so I don\u2019t hope for that much. Maybe I will go to do kae chong, a tradition where we visit a temple or shrine to mitigate bad luck.

It demonstrates that in spite of all the workload research and initiatives, and efforts by schools to write wellbeing policies and show staff that they are valued, any success in reducing workload is marginal. There\u2019s an enormous gap between the image propagated by the Department for Education\u2019s Every Lesson Shapes a Life adverts, which show smiling teachers engaged in constant life-enhancing interaction that makes a real difference to pupils\u2019 educational progress and wellbeing, and the reality of long lonely evenings spent glued to a computer away from family and friends. If the DfE doesn\u2019t want to show this downside, perhaps it should do more to cull the excessive unproductive bureaucracy that\u2019s destroying the profession. Too often, workload solutions are \u201ctips\u201d and \u201chacks\u201d \u2013 quick tactics to cut corners rather than long-term strategic solutions that address the burgeoning bureaucracy that is directly responsible for poor recruitment and retention rates. What is really needed is a full-scale job evaluation to identify the core educational activities that teachers are uniquely able to perform. Leaders should evaluate using the mantra from the DfE\u2019s 2016 Marking Policy Review Group report to ensure that all tasks are \u201cmeaningful, manageable and motivating\u201d, and cull the rest.

The least agriculturally productive acreages are to be unyoked from cultivation \u2013 large herbivores will manage what springs from the boggy soils and there are hopes, soon, of beavers. Elsewhere, farming is switching to regenerative methods and tree cover is set to increase through a mixture of natural regeneration and planting with stock grown from seed gathered by hand \u2013 a huge effort boosted by volunteers. When I call into the estate\u2019s tree nursery, Guy Thallon, the head of natural environment, is chatting to nurserymen Josh and Henry.

It\u2019s odd, Josh muses, as other species growing alongside are reaching \u2013 conventionally \u2013 skywards. Then he says that the deviants are bound for disposal. They won\u2019t fit in tree guards and no one wants bent trees anyway. Rowans have a strong appeal, aesthetically, ecologically and culturally. They are pioneers and bird magnets, at home on exposed crags in minimal soil, and thus ideally suited as urban \u201camenity trees\u201d, because a city street has much in common with a rocky mountainside. Their associated mythology and folklore is almost boundless, encompassing associations with life, fertility, fire, blood, death, transition and magic of the quickening, protective kind. I discover that the Castle Howard rowans are all bending the same way, to the south. Reaching for the light. I hard relate. When Guy offers to gift me a few trees of my choice as thanks for some small favours last year, I go back to the determinedly bent rowans, and pick four of the wonkiest I can find. They\u2019ll grow potted for now while I work out what they might have to tell me.

Defending the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2019s findings of corrupt conduct on the part of Berejiklian, Stephen Free SC told the court of appeal Berejiklian\u2019s \u201cvision for her future\u201d with her Liberal colleague had impacted her judgment. The court sat on Tuesday for the second day of a judicial review of the Icac findings that the former state leader engaged in corrupt conduct and breached the public trust by failing to disclose her relationship with Maguire. Berejiklian\u2019s barrister, Bret Walker SC, on Monday argued that viewing a relationship as a \u201cstanding potential for impropriety\u201d was a \u201cblack, depressing and utterly unrealistic view of human life\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He also argued there was no evidence that Berejiklian\u2019s wanting to maintain or progress her relationship with the former Wagga Wagga MP had impacted her decision-making. The claim was rebutted by Free on Tuesday. He told the court there was a \u201crational foundation\u201d for the finding and that Maguire was a \u201cspecial kind of serial pest\u201d in his lobbying of the former premier. \u201cHe was agitating for his interests in his electorate by taking advantage of a particular emotional relationship that existed only as between them,\u201d he told the court. Free said there was evidence that Maguire had an \u201cemotional hold\u201d over Berejiklian. He argued that the former premier\u2019s \u201cvision for her future\u201d, including the prospect of marriage and children with the MP, meant she had a special interest in him, \u201cwhich she obviously did not have with any other local member\u201d. Berijiklian has maintained that she did not give Maguire special treatment. Between 2016 and 2018, Berejiklian was involved in approving or supporting allocations of millions of dollars in government funds to projects in Maguire\u2019s electorate. While acknowledging others in the cabinet had also supported these projects, Free said that did not mean Berejiklian\u2019s judgment had not being affected by her relationship with the local MP. \u201cShe was influenced by not just her assessment of the merits of the proposals but a desire to maintain her relationship with Mr Maguire,\u201d Free said. Walker retorted that being influenced by someone did not amount to corruption. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t distort political decision-making to take into account the preferences and desires of those whom you admire,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the conduct of human politics by humans.\u201d Berijiklian\u2019s legal team has previously argued the findings were invalid because assistant commissioner Ruth McColl, who in charge of the probe, was no longer at the commission when they were finalised. McColl was yet to complete the report at the end of October 2022 when her term was due to expire. She was given an extension to work as a consultant until she handed her report to the three-person commission in June 2023. He also argued there were several \u201cdefects of reasoning\u201d and legal errors in the findings. Icac had initially been looking into Maguire who was also found to have engaged in serious corrupt conduct. Maguire was alleged to have used his position to conduct a business helping property developers. After Berejiklian was heard on phone taps, she was called to give evidence at Icac and admitted she had been in a \u201cclose personal relationship\u201d with Maguire for several years, which she had not disclosed to colleagues or family. Icac then investigated a number of grants she had been involved in approving for Wagga Wagga as well as her state of knowledge of Maguire\u2019s business dealings. Berejiklian has maintained she served the public interest \u201cat all times\u201d while in office. Last year, Icac found the former premier\u2019s failure to declare a personal conflict of interest in relation to funding for the Australian Clay Target Association and the Riverina Conservatorium of Music was a breach of public trust. Additionally, Icac found Berejiklian engaged in corrupt conduct by failing to report suspicions that Maguire had engaged in corrupt conduct.

However, writer-director Hilmar Oddsson doesn\u2019t need to pander to specific tastes because it\u2019s clear he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing with this happy-sad comedy-drama, a film that hovers on the emotional cusp between tones with consummate skill. The story unfolds in long, languid, static takes, signalling both a kind of arthouse melancholy that at the same time reads as faintly comical, setting up a frame for funny business to take place within its confines, provided the timing is just right. It most certainly is here, thanks not just to Oddsson but also his cast, led by Thr\u00f6stur Le\u00f3 Gunnarsson as Jon, a lonely farmer living in an isolated part of Iceland. In fact, the homestead is so remote, the easiest way to reach it is by boat. Jon, a middle-aged bachelor, lives with his widowed mother (Kristbj\u00f6rg Kjeld), and their perky sheepdog Bresneff (Dreki, a very good boy indeed). Jon and Mamma knit sweaters using the hearty bulky-weight lopi wool which they sell through a local cooperative. Given the story is set vaguely somewhere in the 1970s or 80s, there\u2019s no internet or TV, just cassette recordings of old news bulletins that the boatman delivers when he comes to collect the finished sweaters. One night, sour-faced Mamma dies. Jon feels obliged to honour her last wishes to dress her corpse up in her finest clothes, apply heavy makeup and drive her to the town on the other side of Iceland where she was born to be buried. Bresneff comes along for the ride, looking alert in the front seat while Mamma is strapped in the back of Jon\u2019s Ford Cortina, lookingas if she\u2019s just nodded off. She may be dead but that doesn\u2019t stop her from having conversations with Jon, criticising his life choices like the time he fell in love with a girl named Bergdis (Hera Hilmar). As the journey progresses, he imagines he sees Bergdis in every passing woman with long hair, and slowly he begins to thaw out and open up to the strangers he meets. The comic style is reminiscent of Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismaki, especially the deadpan way the film uses music. At the same time, this is very much an Icelandic film, one that celebrates the breathtaking emptiness of the landscape.

At Saturday night\u2019s awards event, the Palestinian film-maker Basel Adra and the Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham jointly took to the stage on Saturday to accept the best documentary prize for their joint film No Other Land, which charts the eradication of Palestinian villages in the West Bank. Adra said he struggled to celebrate his film\u2019s success while people in Gaza were \u201cbeing slaughtered and massacred\u201d, and urged Germany to cease arms exports to Israel. Speaking immediately afterwards, Abraham decried a \u201csituation of apartheid\u201d that meant that his film-making partner did not enjoy the same voting rights and freedom of movement even though they lived only 30 minutes apart. Abraham ended his acceptance speech with a call for a ceasefire in Gaza, and for a \u201cpolitical solution to end the occupation\u201d. The moment was one of several on the night in which film-makers expressed solidarity with the Palestinian cause in the conflict. The massacre perpetrated by Hamas militants on 7 October was mentioned once, in an opening statement by the Berlinale co-director, Mari\u00ebtte Rissenbeek, that called for the release of Israeli hostages. In Germany, where the government has tacked strongly behind the Israeli government since the start of the conflict, politicians were quick to condemn the event. Berlin\u2019s conservative mayor, Kai Wegner, described the speeches at the Berlinale closing ceremony as an \u201cintolerable relativisation\u201d. \u201cThe full responsibility for the deep suffering in Israel and the Gaza strip lies with Hamas,\u201d Wegner wrote on X. Even though the 10-day film festival\u2019s winners are chosen by independent juries made up of international film professionals, opposition politicians also blamed Germany\u2019s federal commissioner for culture, the Green party politician Claudia Roth, as being responsible for the comments made on-stage. A delegate for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) called for Roth\u2019s resignation, while a politician for the Free Democratic party (FDP) proposed that the film festival\u2019s state funding be withdrawn. The Berlinale, one of the big three European film festivals alongside Cannes and Venice, was financed by the German state with about \u20ac12.9m this year, roughly a third of its overall budget. Roth reacted on Monday by issuing a statement that called the statements at the gala \u201cshockingly one-sided and characterised by deep hatred of Israel\u201d, saying the lack of a mention of Hamas\u2019s terror attack was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. Footage of the awards ceremony, however, put further pressure on the minister of state: in a panoramic shot of the auditorium at the end of Adra and Abraham\u2019s acceptance speech, Roth and Wegner are clearly visible clapping their hands. In a statement on X on Monday, Roth\u2019s office tried to clarify that her applause \u201cwas directed at the Jewish-Israeli journalist and filmmaker Yuval Abraham, who spoke out in favour of a political solution and a peaceful co-existence in the region\u201d. While the conflict in the Middle East divides opinion across western societies, it is proving especially explosive in Germany\u2019s culture sector, where a strong pro-Israel consensus across the main political parties and media publishers is rubbing up against a more politically heterogenous crowd of international artists, who have been drawn to Berlin by its liberal reputation and generous cultural subsidies. In a separate development, the Berlin film festival\u2019s directors announced on Monday that it had filed criminal charges after the hacking of its Panorama section\u2019s Instagram account, which was used to post messages in support of Palestine. Under German law, at least one of the slogans posted can be classified as antisemitic and illegal. One of the images posted on Sunday showed what appeared to be Palestinian children next to the message \u201cCeasefire now \u2013 Stop the genocide in Gaza\u201d, while another read: \u201cGaza, mon amour \u2013 End the German-funded state terror\u201d. A third picture, showing a man on a horse, contained the words \u201cFree Palestine \u2013 from the river to the sea\u201d. While the \u201cFrom the river to the sea\u201d slogan predates the current war in the Middle East by several decades, it has arguably taken on a new, genocidal meaning after 7 October. Last October, the Berlin state\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office announced the phrase was subject to criminal penalties because it negates Israel\u2019s existence. \u201cThese statements do not originate from the festival and do not represent the festival\u2019s stance\u201d, the Berlin film festival said in a statement. \u201cThe posts were deleted immediately and an investigation was launched into how this incident could have occurred.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-27", "section": "World news", "author": "Philip Oltermann European culture editor", "id": 475, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f4fdfe431eec79670ee0a92d45cad791ca6a012c/0_200_6000_3600/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Mary O\u2019Connell: \u2018My whole shtick was complaining about money.

I always liked performing. I did dance and piano when I was younger \u2013 to a mediocre extent \u2013 but standup was something I felt I could be really good at. Obviously if I looked back now at those performances, I\u2019d be well embarrassed but standup requires delusional confidence. I had that when I first tried it and I\u2019ve still got it now. It is also a way of connecting with people but completely, selfishly, on your own terms. Talking without interruption is great. What is the best heckle you\u2019ve had? At my first ever gig I was heckled encouragingly. I can\u2019t remember exactly what they said, something like: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, keep going!\u201d Even though it was supportive, it\u2019s still a disruption and you wouldn\u2019t do that at the National Theatre now, would you? Last year you won \u00a3100,000 in a contest run by OnlyFans, which is not particularly known for comedy content ... It\u2019s the craziest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me! I was a contestant in OnlyFans\u2019 reality TV show where comedians did a bunch of comedy-related challenges. When I applied (at work, to the bemusement and encouragement of my colleagues) the prize was advertised as a measly \u00a350k, if you can believe. I\u2019d done standup competitions before but never for such a big cash prize. I didn\u2019t even know when I applied that it would be a reality TV show. Comedy isn\u2019t valued that highly in terms of money, especially in the UK. Culturally it\u2019s extremely valuable, but just look at the budget for a comedy TV show compared with a drama. The fact that a platform decided to place so much monetary value on something I have done for free, and that this platform also happened to specialise in subscription-based adult entertainment, was hilarious to me. What was the first thing you bought afterwards? I have a lot of money anxiety and winning the competition just made my relationship with money more complicated. I still haven\u2019t bought a stupid, extravagant, gold-plated toilet or anything like that. When I won, it took a long time to process. I think I tried to pretend like everything could still stay the same. The day after I won the money I just went into work, trying to be normal. I did take an Uber though. What\u2019s your show, Money Princess, about? My whole shtick was complaining about money and capitalism and then I won a bunch of money but I still want to complain about it. The show is about how I seem to prioritise all those things over the enjoyment of my own life, even though I think money, work and late stage capitalism are all kind of evil things. Whether I\u2019d won the money or not, I was always a Money Princess. It\u2019s a term that I\u2019m pretty sure I invented. I think it means most plainly, a girly who is aware of money, of having it, of not having it and of the nuances of wanting it. When I started this journey I was one type of Money Princess, now I\u2019m a different type. Do you have any preshow rituals? I have a playlist of songs about money that I\u2019ll have a little dance to backstage. I also do tongue-twisters and mouth exercises. Any comedy heroes? It\u2019s worrying admiring people these days because in a few years they usually turn out to be a horrible person. I love Rik Mayall \u2013 his face was just so ridiculous and I love how he wasn\u2019t afraid to be completely vulgar. And I love Richard Pryor who was just effortless, and so authentic. I should probably also mention someone who\u2019s still alive. Mindy Kaling is incredible and her ability to write flawed, lovable characters is something I\u2019ve always respected. Any bugbears from the world of comedy? It\u2019s still quite an old-fashioned industry. People make assumptions that because of your appearance your comedy will be a certain way and you can only reach certain audiences, which of course is a very limiting way to think. There\u2019s not enough representation, especially of women of colour. Things have got slightly better but there\u2019s always room for improvement and for more opportunities for me \u2013 specifically me \u2013 to get paid. Just kidding, everyone deserves their flowers. What are you excited for at the moment? I\u2019ve just moved into a new flat so I\u2019m very excited and nervous about decorating it. There are so many things you have to get that you don\u2019t even think about. I bought a loo-roll holder yesterday which was humbling yet gratifying.

The couple, who live in Northampton, Massachusetts, had agreed to try polyamory \u2013 they were both free to pursue sexual, intimate relationships with other people. But when Kragness struggled to make an extracurricular connection of her own, she began to feel jealous of Porter\u2019s budding relationship. \u201cI\u2019d get snappy or grumpy right before they went on a date,\u201d Kragness said. \u201cI would pick a fight, get isolated or cold. None of that is healthy or positive.\u201d Things worsened. The couple spent less time together, avoided talking and slept in different bedrooms. At a family wedding, the bubbling drama boiled over, and the couple confronted their issues head-on. \u201cA decision had to be made: are we going to continue together, or are we going to part ways because of the poly lifestyle?\u201d Kragness said. Kragness didn\u2019t want to come off as manipulative. If Porter wished to stay poly, that was fine by her, but they would have to break up. \u201cPeople said we were done for,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the view was that when people open their relationship, it all falls apart.\u201d But after some soul-searching, Kragness and Porter decided to stick it out \u2013 and close their relationship. Polyamory (having multiple partners at once consensually) and open relationships (where couples pursue other sexual relationships but tend to stay emotionally connected to just each other) aren\u2019t anything new. The anarchist revolutionary Emma Goldman advocated for \u201cfree love\u201d in place of \u201cthat poor little State and Church-begotten weed, marriage\u201d in the 1910s, while many in the queer community practiced open relationships long before \u201cpolycule\u201d became a TikTok buzzword. But Covid changed conceptions of love and intimacy on a wider scale. This year saw the release of More, a memoir by Molly Roden Winter, in which the white, upper-class Brooklyn mom recounts juggling polyamory with parenting. Peacock\u2019s salaciously named reality show Couple to Throuple follows four pairs who, while living together in a tropical resort, mull adding a third party into the mix. (What could go wrong?) And last month, New York magazine released its \u201cpractical guide to modern polyamory\u201d, which included rules and tips on how to ethically open up a relationship. It can feel like everyone\u2019s open now \u2013 according to a recent Match study, one-third of respondents had experimented with consensual non-monogamy. But what if it doesn\u2019t work out? A failed attempt at polyamory might lead to a devastating breakup, even when some couples, like Kragness and Porter, might not be ready to call it just yet. \u201cBeing open started and ended with an agreed mutual decision: we were advocating for our personal needs, and we had a willingness to try,\u201d Kragness said. \u201cBut ultimately, we decided that we want each other in our lives, and that\u2019s not something that\u2019s possible for me if we\u2019re poly.\u201d There were awkward moments during the repair process: when Porter broke up with their other partner, it was difficult for Kragness to support them as they grieved the loss of another lover. For now, the couple \u2013 who are getting ready to celebrate their sixth anniversary \u2013 describe themselves as \u201cmonogamish\u201d. They\u2019re not actively pursuing sexual relationships with other people, but they might in the future. Deeper, emotional connections with other people remain verboten. Struggling with the \u2018Olympics of relationships\u2019 Shai Fishman is a Pennsylvania entrepreneur who also runs an online community for the polyamorous called Leveled Up Love. He says the lifestyle has helped him learn to better communicate with partners and advocate for his sexual desires \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s for everyone. Fishman often sees open relationships close, especially if a couple rushed into it or thought that trying non-monogamy might serve as a Band-Aid for pre-existing problems. \u201cI joke that polyamory is like the Olympics of relationships,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cSome people are going to struggle. There are these idealistic approaches to polyamory, and when jealousy and insecurity smacks someone in the face, they could run for the hills.\u201d In Massachusetts, the Puritan state, of all places, three cities allow more than two people to be in domestic relationships, and two of those cities have laws on the books protecting polyamorous families from discrimination. In California, Berkeley and Oakland have introduced similar bills. And in New York, the therapist Daniel Rich says half his clients are couples who engage in some sort of non-monogamous structure. When things go wrong, about half of those couples break up. \u201cThese relationships can stir up so many big feelings,\u201d Rich said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to attribute the end of a relationship to it being open. But a lot of times, it really ends because of issues that were already present in the relationship, such as a lack of communication or trust.\u201d He says the couples who do tough it out can have a long road of rebuilding after closing their relationships back up. At first, Jeannie, a 53-year-old administrative worker from New York, enjoyed opening her marriage. She\u2019d never been with people other than her husband, whom she\u2019s known since high school and had gone through long dry spells with. The sex drought was so prominent, in fact, that Jeannie once spoke to the women\u2019s magazine Self for an article about not having enough sex. (Jeannie is a pseudonym.) Opening up the marriage felt like the \u201ccapstone\u201d of a process during which Jeannie became more comfortable with her sexuality. She took pole dancing lessons and courses on women\u2019s empowerment. One night in 2018, Jeannie kissed someone who wasn\u2019t her husband at a party; the couple calls that date their \u201cpolyversary\u201d. Jeannie thought this new period of self-discovery and erotic exploration was fun: \u201cI went on tons of dates, went to parties, and met lots of people.\u201d But her husband wasn\u2019t as successful and found dating hard. That was, until he met someone he really liked \u2013 and eventually, loved. Gradually, the tables turned on Jeannie. \u201cI never expected that to happen,\u201d she said. Her one night stands began to feel like a \u201crevolving door\u201d of lovers who weren\u2019t satisfying. Meanwhile, her husband was falling deeper in love with his new girlfriend. \u201cIs she another soulmate?\u201d Jeannie wondered. \u201cIt was jarring to my reality, and I didn\u2019t know where I fit.\u201d Things came to a head during the fall of 2020: \u201cI told my husband that if he was poly by nature and needed that in his life, that was OK, but I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Jeannie said. They agreed to give their closed marriage another shot by rebuilding their relationship and clarifying their desires. \u201cWe did all of the things: couples therapy, individual therapy, medicine journeys,\u201d Jeannie said. It wasn\u2019t easy, and there was collateral damage. Jeannie\u2019s husband harbored resentment for having to break up with his girlfriend, whom he never intended to hurt; she was devastated. But he and Jeannie still made a point to commit. \u201cWe had breakfast together every day and learned how to be better communicators,\u201d Jeannie said. They also wrote up a \u201crelationship agreement\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s 20 pages long, with an appendix \u2013 that breaks down their priorities as a couple, what\u2019s OK to do, and what\u2019s not. After a few years closed, Jeannie and her husband opened up again with that agreement in mind. No regrets about trying polyamory Sometimes, relationships start out polyamorous. Such was the case with Rome, a 24-year-old bookseller from New Mexico who has dated his partner Andi for about a year. For the first six months, they agreed to be open. Both wanted to explore relationship anarchy, an ethos that prioritizes autonomy and community over monogamy\u2019s rules for romance. The couple scheduled monthly \u201ccheck-ins\u201d to talk about their feelings and discuss how things were going. (Rome and Andi asked that their last names not be used.) \u201cWe had a rule where we\u2019d only tell each other what we needed to know: for example, we would only tell each other about a new relationship if we thought it was going to be an ongoing thing,\u201d Rome explained. There were times when they\u2019d accidentally reveal \u201ctoo much\u201d to each other: \u201cI was at a concert with someone else, and I told my partner how we were having a really great time, and they said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear about that,\u2019\u201d Rome recalled. For his part, Rome found himself feeling \u201con edge\u201d when he thought about Andi going out with other people. Andi, who is 27 and works as a graduate teaching associate, said they had grown exhausted with the pace of dating outside of a relationship. \u201cThe thought of having the door open for romantic connections grew less of a priority, given my energy and emotional capacity,\u201d they said. Still, when Andi thought about having the \u201clet\u2019s close up\u201d conversation, they felt anxious. \u201cWe met on a dating app that\u2019s used by non-monogamous folks, and Rome reads a lot about polyamory and its benefits. I had this fear that my asking for monogamy might be read as a control or coercion thing. I worried that this person I cared about so much would think that I was trying to limit the meaningful connections he can have for other people.\u201d But there were no tears or big, blowout arguments. In fact, the scene could have been straight out of a romcom: during one of their check-ins, Andi told Rome they weren\u2019t seeing anyone. Rome told them he wasn\u2019t either. They came to the conclusion that it should stay that way. None of the couples who spoke to the Guardian said they regretted being open, or believed monogamy to be the only way to date. It\u2019s just what is best for them at this time. \u201cSociety hands us these boxes and says, \u2018These are the only options,\u2019 and certain compulsory behaviors are so ingrained in our society,\u201d Rome said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s OK to change your mind.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-28", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Alaina Demopoulos", "id": 479, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d98db1c8b9e69f3420089a366f5314d836803ba0/2_0_5674_3407/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Mary & George: epic drama and ruff sex \u2013 this is everything you want in a period romp ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/29/mary-george-epic-drama-and-ruff-sex-this-is-everything-you-want-in-a-period-romp", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.076, "neu": 0.656, "pos": 0.268, "compound": 0.9985}, "body": "The hardest part of this job is writing about drama. How do you get revved up for drama? \u201cThey said things in the right way. No jokes. Everyone was delivering their lines very earnestly. And then drama happened.\u201d Every time a big drama project rolls around I worry: what can I say about the costume choices, the music, the direction? Because the acting in these things is always very pure, good, capital-A acting, and then never really gives me a critical in. It\u2019s just: it\u2019s drama. Mary &amp; George (5 March, 9pm, Sky Atlantic) then, which is a drama. The costumes are nice, the music is genuinely fantastic, the direction is gorgeous. But actually, something texturally interesting about Mary &amp; George captured me from the off, and that\u2019s it now. I get what you lot are always on about. Drama is good, finally, and I see why it always ends up winning awards. The brief of Mary &amp; George is so good: Julianne Moore plays Mary Villiers, a famously scheming real-life Countess of Buckingham, who is jagging around merry olde England in the early 1600s, doing a low, blunt English accent and trying to hustle her second-born son, George (played cheekboningly well by Red, White &amp; Royal Blue\u2019s Nicholas Galitzine). Don\u2019t you want to watch Julianne Moore use her gorgeous adult son as a sexy royal pawn? You do, and I do too, and we\u2019re right to. The two leads are great \u2013 Galitzine\u2019s George is moping and moaning and wet and soft, until a formative trip to France turns him into a sexy little harlot, and Moore is, well, Moore: scheming and manipulative and charming, always running her eyes from left to right as she tries to calculate the next shrewd social chess move, inscrutable. They are both bastards, basically, but doing it in such a fun knowing way that it\u2019s dynamising to watch. \u201cKnowing\u201d is the operative word here: it would be easy to label a show like this as \u201ccamp\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite right. There is a lot of enjoyable historical queerness, of course \u2013 Villiers is constantly trying to get her son in front of the wandering eye of King James I (a joyously lewd Tony Curran), there\u2019s a lot of sucking the juices of a fresh ripe fruit off a thumb, a lot of suggestive dangly gold earrings and everyone is constantly eating their dinner in a brothel \u2013 but despite that, the sex in Mary &amp; George is almost always power over lust, and is played as such. Mary &amp; George pulsates with \u201cromp\u201d energy, and it would be easy to lean into that, but what everyone is doing here is far more interesting: Laurie Davidson\u2019s Robert Carr is screen-grabbingly villainous, Niamh Algar is full of bolshie intrigue, Sean Gilder\u2019s Sir Thomas Compton a perfect TV grump. I am a sucker for a period-ish drama where everyone, nevertheless, talks like they\u2019re normal (last year\u2019s The Gallows Pole and Mary &amp; George are comparable in that regard, though with a valley-sized class divide between them), and this lands right in the sweet spot: a complete absence of \u201cyes my Lord, no my Lord\u201d, and instead wicked little characters t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eateing behind velvet curtains. Two more compliments before I let you go off and try to figure out how to make the Sky box series-link this then get frustrated and give up: there are a couple of directorial choices that make Mary &amp; George feel fresh and new and interesting. One of them is \u2013 and this is going to blow your mind \u2013 no drone shots. Perhaps period productions in recent years have suffered from a trend of \u201cover-epic-ing\u201d (too many sweeping camera angles, too many catapults flinging rocks into the mist: the same way sci-fi sometimes feels like two computers being a bit mad at each other) but M&amp;G feels very low-down and real as a result.

The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, is to overhaul the way local authorities fine parents for unauthorised school absences by bringing penalties \u201cunder a national framework to help tackle inconsistencies\u201d. The Department for Education said that fines \u201cmust be considered if a child misses five days of school for unauthorised absence\u201d, with local authorities currently having wide variation over whether they levy fines. Under the new rules, the initial penalty notices will be raised from \u00a360 to \u00a380, if paid within 21 days. Those who delay payment will have fines raised from \u00a3120 to \u00a3160. Schools\u2019 daily registers will also be shared online with the DfE and local authorities, as part of the government\u2019s drive to improve attendance from its post-Covid slump. Keegan said: \u201cOur fantastic schools and teachers unlock children\u2019s imagination, potential and social skills, which is why improving attendance is my number one priority. \u201cToday we are taking that next step to further boost attendance and I want to thank those who are working with us, including teachers and heads.\u201d Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, stressed that most fines were applied to children taken on holidays during term time, while higher absences were often the result of serious issues such as mental health problems. Barton said: \u201cThere is a wider issue about absence relating to the growing number of children who suffer from anxiety, families who are struggling to cope, and disengagement with education, which schools are endeavouring to address by working with families and pupils to improve their attendance rather than using fines. \u201cSchools need more help from the government in this work, both in terms of the funding they receive and investment in local social care, attendance and mental health services. \u201cEducation has become an unofficial fourth emergency service, picking up the pieces for a decade-long erosion of support services. This cannot go on.\u201d In 2022-23, out of a total 399,000 penalty notices, a record 350,000 parents in England were fined for taking their children out of school for unauthorised holidays. The total was 20% higher than in 2018-19, the last full school year before the pandemic. Labour\u2019s Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe Conservatives are only just waking up to the damage of persistent absence that has reached historic levels on their watch, but their answer addresses the symptoms of absence, not the causes. \u201cPersistent absence was rising long before the pandemic, the result of growing unaddressed mental ill health, the impact of years of economic decline hitting family finances and a breakdown of trust between schools and families.\u201d", "date": "2024-02-29", "section": "Education", "author": "Richard Adams Education editor", "id": 481, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dbeb15448a223f4e5ce28e77fa6daf83dfc03516/0_99_3000_1801/500.jpg"}, {"title": "NSW rejects claim it lags on renewables, citing 18 projects approved in 2023 ", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/29/nsw-renewable-energy-projects-chris-minns-government", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.045, "neu": 0.727, "pos": 0.229, "compound": 0.9983}, "body": "The New South Wales government has rejected industry criticism its approvals of renewable energy projects lag other states, saying planning had finalised support for 18 significant wind, solar and battery projects in 2023. The defence came as federal, state and territory energy ministers gather in Canberra for the first meeting of 2024 on Friday. Speeding up the rollout of renewable energy along with an updated national hydrogen strategy are understood to be on the agenda. In data released to Guardian Australia, the Minns government said the 18 projects given support last year would generate enough clean energy to power more than 1.5m homes with a combined capacity of 7.6 gigawatts of generation and storage. More than 3,000 jobs would also result during construction and operation of those projects, with 8.3m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions avoided each year. These include Virya Energy\u2019s proposed 1.5GW Yanco Delta windfarm with 208 turbines in the Riverina region, which would be Australia\u2019s largest. \u201cThese approvals represent the NSW government\u2019s commitment to accelerate the transition to renewables so households and businesses have reliable access to clean and affordable electricity,\u201d said the energy minister, Penny Sharpe. \u201cNSW is now about halfway towards our 2030 renewable generation target, and over a quarter of the way there on our long-duration storage target.\u201d The pace of renewable energy\u2019s introduction will feature prominently at Friday\u2019s energy ministers gathering.

Also on the agenda will be details of an updated national hydrogen strategy. Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, Victoria\u2019s energy minister, will also brief counterparts about this month\u2019s severe storms that knocked out a key transmission line and blew over power poles, cutting off power to about half a million homes. The event underscored the need for greater resilience of electricity networks, an issue Victoria had pressed in meetings last year. A spokesperson for the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, declined to comment ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting. The reliability of the power grid may again be tested later on Thursday. An actual so-called level one lack of reserve event was reported in NSW by the market operator as temperatures in parts of Sydney reached 40C in a late-summer heatwave, pushing up electricity demand. Renewable investors had singled out NSW as the state with some of the highest hurdles to clear to get projects to completion. Late last year, the state\u2019s planning department surprised some in the industry with a map that appeared to discourage windfarms, even from parts of its designated renewable energy zones. The map was later revised. The Clean Energy Investment Group also recently released a report calling for \u201cgreater approval and timing certainty for clean energy projects\u201d. It said windfarms in NSW were taking an average 3,488 days for approval \u2013 or almost 10 years \u2013 with solar farms taking 705 days. Battery projects needed 540 days, while hydro and transmission projects were taking 492 days on average. Simon Corbell, the group\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday he \u201cstrongly\u201d welcomed the finalising of planning assessments, particularly for the Yanco Delta windfarm. \u201cHowever, the total number of wind projects approved remains low, compared to solar and battery storage,\u201d Corbell said. \u201cOnshore wind energy is the lowest cost form of new utility scale generation available today and will play a central role as thermal coal continues to exit the system.\u201d Corbell\u2019s group wants to see the NSW government further expedite planning assessment in the draft energy assessment guidelines currently under consideration. Of particular concern are changes to the proposed visual amenity assessment criteria for wind projects, he said. Nicholas Aberle, a Clean Energy Council director, said NSW had had \u201ca patchy few years in terms of project approvals, especially wind farms and has historically been much slower than other states\u201d. \u201cThe approvals in the last few months have been a welcome change, but this pace needs to be maintained,\u201d Aberle said. \u201cThe NSW government\u2019s current review of planning guidelines for wind farms needs to deliver a framework that is fit for the purpose of ensuring renewable energy projects are built at the pace needed to replace ageing coal power stations and to reduce climate emissions.\u201d Paul Scully, NSW\u2019s planning minister, said renewable energy projects would \u201chelp deliver clean and affordable energy to NSW residents while injecting millions of dollars into regional economies and creating hundreds of new jobs\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with industry and impacted communities to strike the right balance between supporting renewable energy projects and responsible development,\u201d Scully said.", "date": "2024-02-29", "section": "Australia news", "author": "Peter Hannam", "id": 482, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/05d0fda7e1a23eb7cda9d86f14a0e203d9761099/0_515_4032_2419/500.jpg"}, {"title": "How can I lift the burden of a weighty Virgin Media package for my friend?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/feb/29/how-can-i-lift-the-burden-of-a-weighty-virgin-media-package-for-my-friend", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.071, "neu": 0.715, "pos": 0.214, "compound": 0.9832}, "body": "I have a severely disabled friend.

Recently, I discovered that he is paying Virgin Media between \u00a3144 and \u00a3175 a month for his TV broadband/landline package. He does watch Sky TV, Netflix and use his phone, but he has no need for Sky Sports which is included in his bill. I can\u2019t help believing that his bill could be substantially reduced. Can you help? AF, Hertfordshire These cases are very difficult because we never know what the person agreed to when they took out the contract. I agree that on the face of it, though, \u00a3175 a month is a crazy sum to be paying. I asked Virgin Media to contact the customer, and having done so it has concluded that he is on the best bundle for his needs \u2013 albeit still at a whopping \u00a3120 a month. This includes Premium Netflix which is worth \u00a317.99 if bought separately, and Sky Sports that he doesn\u2019t need, but wouldn\u2019t save any money by ditching. That said, I think you could help him bring this bill down significantly by establishing which channels he actually watches, and then switching to the Sky home entertainment package that fits his needs. I would also suggest he opts for a daytime telephone calls package, as this appears to be pushing up the bill. He would have to buy the Netflix package directly, but this would take about five minutes to set up. Whether he can face the disruption, only you and he can decide.

Its lead track, Fan the Flames, was one of those songs that just stops you in your tracks. It seemed to be rooted in music that had far less to do with punk than the mainstream hard rock that predominated when punk first reared its head: there was Thin Lizzy and quite possibly some Lynyrd Skynyrd in its unhurried sound, while lead guitarist Kyle Seely was audibly engaged in the kind of playing that would once have been approvingly referred to as \u201claying down\u201d some \u201ctasty licks\u201d. But the sound was lo-fi and absolutely everything was caked in distortion, including the voice of Tina Halladay, a potent, soulful wail that, on closer inspection, was delivering a call-to-arms against unscrupulous landlords and gentrification. Between the classic rock references, the noise, the dextrous musicianship, the vocal delivery and the righteously pissed-off lyrics lurked the exciting sense that this was a band who weren\u2019t quite like anyone else around at the moment, amplified by the fact that Sheer Mag didn\u2019t do social media, or grant interviews to the press. Since then, Sheer Mag have eased up on their media blackout and released two full-length albums that honed the sound found on Fan the Flames: retro-glancing rock of the hard \u2013 and, occasionally, soft \u2013 variety, noisy punk/garage aesthetics, political lyrics, killer guitar playing and Halladay\u2019s equally killer voice. Both 2017\u2019s Need to Feel Your Love and 2019\u2019s A Distant Call come highly recommended \u2013 if you\u2019re in the market for a vaguely New Wave of British Heavy Metal-influenced call for armed socialist revolution, hasten to the latter album\u2019s Chopping Block \u2013 but Playing Favorites is a noticeably different beast. For one thing, it started life as a disco EP \u2013 an attempt, the band have suggested, to shake off personal difficulties through euphoric music. These origins are still intermittently audible on Playing Favorites, both in lyrics that deal with emotional upheaval \u2013 not least the death of Halladay\u2019s abusive father \u2013 and in its sound. You hear disco during the breezy All Lined Up and the episodic Mechanical Garden, which slips from tough powerpop to orchestral interlude to intricate funk, complete with blazing guitar solo courtesy of Mdou Moctar. Moonstruck, meanwhile, dramatically diverts from its slide guitar-strafed country rock intro and heads euphorically towards the dancefloor, bearing a freewheeling melody that has a hint of the Jackson 5\u2019s I Want You Back in its DNA. But the music here clearly outgrew its original remit, not least to include songs that fit Halladay\u2019s description of the band\u2019s USP \u2013 \u201cnobody [else] seems to write straight-up rock bangers any more\u201d \u2013 although they\u2019re wont to leave you wondering whether \u201cstraight-up\u201d isn\u2019t a knowingly reductive view of what Sheer Mag do. Eat It and Beat It might be rooted in old-fashioned, blue-collar heartlands American rock, but it arrives stripped of that genre\u2019s swaggering machismo, replaced with simmering anger at the state of things. Essentially a rallying call for a new generation of rock bands, it still seems to keep casting its eyes towards societal iniquities: \u201cDon\u2019t bother with the referee, it\u2019s all going back to the company.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that isn\u2019t entirely without historical precedent (tellingly, when once asked to pick the song they wished they had written, Halladay and Matt Palmer picked Judas Priest\u2019s Breaking the Law, which beneath its potent riffs and preposterous video, is a song mired in fury about unemployment in early 80s Britain), but it still sounds fresh and vital. So do the moments on Playing Favorites where Sheer Mag sound like they\u2019re expanding outwards, either tonally \u2013 there appears to be a celeste on Tea on the Kettle; a tumbling acoustic guitar figure introduces the title track \u2013 or in leaning more towards pop. Everything is still lightly battered in distortion, as though the band were still recording on a cheap 8-track tape in a bedroom, but the snarl in Halladay\u2019s voice is dialled back, the melodies on Golden Hour and closer When You Get Back ring a little more sweetly than in the past. The latter song is a triumph \u2013 dressed with vocal harmonies, the Thin Lizzy-ish twin guitars chiming joyously \u2013 but in truth, everything here is done really well. There\u2019s doubtless someone ready to grouse about the moments that take a softer approach, but you struggle to see that argument gaining a lot of traction. Even at its most melodious, Playing Favorites still sounds fierce and raw, an object lesson in altering your sound without losing your essence. This week Alexis listened to Musclecars \u2013 Ha Ya!

Part of her struggle to find her own place (or even a homeless shelter in her area) is that many landlords don\u2019t accept pets and she has a cat. She\u2019s basically starting her life over. Her skills are minimal (no degrees or specialised training), no car, and she just left a big city for the small town that we live in. She and I both know that it will be months upon months of living with us. She has spent the last five years caring for her mother, who had dementia. As much as I\u2019m humbled and honoured to give her a leg up, I\u2019m terrified that she will be living with us for a long time. My focus on myself and my own goals are fragmented at this point, because I\u2019m trying to help her out, too. She\u2019s also afraid of doing anything alone. I\u2019m trying to think of realistic boundaries/timelines to set with her; but in all reality she may not have her ducks in a row. I will not allow her to be homeless; but my sanity may be on the line if she\u2019s going to be my permanent roommate. Any advice? Eleanor says: You\u2019re doing a good thing. It sounds like your friend fell hard and bit the asphalt \u2013 mourning a parent, losing years of possible career time to caretaking, and now without a home. In a culture of \u201cyou don\u2019t owe anyone anything\u201d, you\u2019re doing a good thing. But the fact something is good to do doesn\u2019t necessarily make it easy \u2013 total compliance with morality would probably make life worse and leave you without any bits of sweetness or solitude. And boundaries are going to be important \u2013 you don\u2019t want to wind up like the giving tree, sawing off your own limbs so someone else has a place to sit. How to balance the imperative for kindness with the need to protect your own sanity? I think one place to start is recruiting as much help as you can to improve her situation. Precarious housing is a broader category than people think. It includes couchsurfers and people who\u2019ve been evicted and people staying with friends or family in just the way that your friend is. If your own ingenuity or industry could fix the problems that put people in these situations, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone in them any more. There are professionals and groups who have more experience than either of you in getting people back to more permanent housing. If you can encourage her to grab hold of as much qualified help as possible, that will simultaneously make it more likely that she finds a solution, and less likely that finding that solution will devour all your time and focus. It can be really easy for people to put off engaging this kind of help \u2013 out of shame, social awkwardness or the sense that it\u2019s only for people in worse positions. If you can frame it as a kindness to you for her to seek this kind of help, it might overcome those feelings. It might also help to be specific about what\u2019s putting your sanity on the line. If you can name exactly what you need and aren\u2019t getting, it\u2019s easier to find ways to provide it, even in slightly compromised ways. If it\u2019s about solitude \u2013 if you\u2019re like me and without enough alone time your brain goes like an old TV tuned to nothing, just static and bands of nonsense colours \u2013 you could try to find slivers of alone time even while she\u2019s living with you. You could ask for X many nights to yourself, and make them predictable and recurring, so you can plan and look forward to them. Or if it\u2019s about feeling overwhelmed with responsibility for another person\u2019s future, you could work on small ways to call your focus back. Mark periods of the day off as times when you do not think about this, or practice directing her (and you) to professionals instead. One final thing would be to make sure you keep careful track of the common ground between you. You don\u2019t want to be thinking \u201cI wonder how long until she finds a place to stay\u201d while she\u2019s thinking \u201cthank heavens I\u2019ve found a place to stay\u201d. Try to make sure that you\u2019re each continuously upfront about what the other expects. If it comes to it, and you feel like you\u2019ve ended up with too-porous boundaries, try to remember the fortune-cookie wisdom: would you rather be non-confrontational or treated fairly? This is a really good thing you\u2019re doing. Not many people put their money (or their house) where their mouth is in this way. Just try to make sure it doesn\u2019t obscure her longer-term path. *** Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

Now, as baby boomers, you start getting advertisements for people completely mysteriously making tomato sandwiches in conservatories talking to the camera about their insurance and funeral plans, stepping out of baths, lifting themselves out of electric armchairs, mobility scooters and incontinence pads.

TurangaLeela2 and TopTramp Who says that I haven\u2019t, didn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, aren\u2019t at this very moment? No, you\u2019re right. Good heavens, I wish I were that clever. There are brands of clever. There\u2019s smart quick. You look at someone like Lee Mack and you think: \u201cHow does a brain operate that fast?\u201d You get other people who have a cleverness of verbal facility and talk about philosophy, history and poetry all in one go. And then there are others who have a kind of intelligence that\u2019s a wisdom, an insight into human behaviour that\u2019s nothing to do with education. How to cope with life: you don\u2019t need education for that. People use the great phrase: \u201cCan\u2019t sit the right way on a toilet seat\u201d to mean doesn\u2019t have any common sense. But so there are so many wildly different kinds of intelligence. I\u2019m aware that I have verbal facility and that I have a good memory and I\u2019m very pleased about those things. If only they helped in things like a cure for cancer. What would have happened if it was Laurie and Fry and your career had taken the path of Hugh\u2019s and him yours? TurangaLeela2 I think if I had his physical talents for sport: tennis, cricket, football, rowing \u2026 I can\u2019t even dive into a swimming pool. If I could sing and play an instrument, I would sit all day at the piano. But it\u2019s a bit like a flatfooted platypus looking up at an eagle and saying: \u201cIf I could fly, I would do this. I would do that.\u201d Hugh\u2019s life is brilliant and he\u2019s earned it and the respect and affection in which people hold him is so fully deserved. He\u2019s a wonderful, wise, kind, good, funny, clever man, and brilliantly talented. In many ways, his life is much more admirable and enviable than mine. And yet I wouldn\u2019t swap. It loops back to your question about old age. One of the things you come to terms with is that your life is your life, and all the terrible mistakes, wrong terms, regrets and I wishes and why didn\u2019t I? You do actually think: \u201cWell, it was my life and I led it, and I wouldn\u2019t really have it any other way.\u201d \u2022 The Inventor is in Vue cinemas from 8 March", "date": "2024-02-29", "section": "Film", "author": "As told to Rich Pelley", "id": 486, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/58345e857a9adf9aa3732dbdc5795268d5eaa6aa/0_88_5928_3557/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Richard Lewis: the Curb favourite and standup legend who never hid he was having a great time", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/feb/29/richard-lewis-tribute-larry-david-friends-curb-your-enthusiasm", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.095, "neu": 0.636, "pos": 0.268, "compound": 0.9963}, "body": "Just last night, before I woke up to the news that comedy legend Richard Lewis has passed away at 76, I was watching him duke it out with Larry David. There is a very funny scene in the new season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, a gloriously volcanic t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate on a golf course where the two men \u2013 playing heightened versions of themselves \u2013 start bickering, hardly for the first time in the show\u2019s 12 seasons. \u201cI\u2019m leaving you in my will \u2013 I\u2019m tweaking it and you\u2019re in it,\u201d Lewis snaps, triggering the following vein-bulging exchange: David: If bequeathed, I will not accept! Lewis: Well, I\u2019m bequeathing. David: Well, I\u2019m not accepting! Lewis: Well, you have to accept! David: Don\u2019t give it to me! Lewis: Don\u2019t hurt my feelings! David: I\u2019m not gonna keep a penny of it! Lewis: You\u2019re hurting me! David: Thank you, but I don\u2019t want it! Lewis: I\u2019m giving it to you anyway, pal! David: Oh my god, fuck you! This absurd moment perfectly encapsulates how well these two old friends worked together. \u201cRichard and I were born three days apart in the same hospital and for most of my life he\u2019s been like a brother to me,\u201d David said after Lewis\u2019s death was announced. You can feel the very real affection between these guys, though neither would stand for schmaltz. It is why any Curb fan can watch them argue ad infinitum \u2013 and also because a fight over their relationship\u2019s \u201cobligation imbalance\u201d could somehow become a discussion of the linguistic similarities between Mussolini, the dictator and Mucinex, the cold and flu medicine. Lewis\u2019s schtick was a slightly calmer counter to David\u2019s, but always acerbic and always ready to pick and needle. Both on camera and in real life, he was almost always dressed in all black \u2013 in Curb he was sometimes overdressed in black, one vaguely military-looking outfit prompting David to ask him: \u201cAre you vying for the title of the most pretentious man in the world?\u201d And on and on we go. Watching these guys go to town on each other never gets old. So often when Lewis performed, you can see a cheeky, impish gleam in those big eyes: he was having a great time. Much of his career was in standup comedy, positioning the bulk of his work in live and ephemeral art as \u201cthe Prince of Pain\u201d, as well clocking up a whopping 48 appearances on Late Night with David Letterman. His film credits include Prince John in 1993\u2019s Robin Hood: Men in Tights, directed by Mel Brooks who once said that Lewis \u201cmay just be the Franz Kafka of modern-day comedy\u201d. Lewis brings a hilariously manic, bulging-eyed energy to the role, such as when he insists that the Sheriff of Rottingham must deliver some bad news \u201cin a good way\u201d (then, of course, admonishes him for making light of a terrible situation). Lewis also starred alongside Jamie Lee Curtis in the well-loved late 80s sitcom Anything But Love, bringing the funnies as neurotic journalist Marty Gold. In the opening scene we see him board a flight while desperately trying to \u201cforget the fact that five million pounds of metal is slightly heavier than air\u201d. In no time he\u2019s engaged in a spritzy banter with Hannah Miller, played by Curtis, another of Lewis\u2019s great conversational sparring partners. It was 30 years before his final turn in Curb, but even then you could clearly see Lewis was enjoying himself, loving the banter and relishing the comedy, but never winking too hard at the audience.

You may have more free time, perhaps more money; you\u2019re not constrained by pressure to start a family. Whether you are looking for abundant casual sex, or marriage number whatever, here experts offer advice on getting back out there. Are you ready? If you are new to dating in later life, you are probably finding yourself in this situation as a result of something painful: divorce or bereavement. However a long relationship ends, there will be a feeling of grief. \u201cSociety doesn\u2019t like grief,\u201d says Andrew G Marshall, a marital therapist and the host of The Meaningful Life podcast. \u201cWe want to make it better straight away and we try to parcel everybody up into a couple again. The problem is, if you date too soon, you bring all the old relationship issues into the new one, or you bring the ghost of the old relationship. It could be that there is quite a bit of recuperation or learning to do.\u201d Therapy may help, but Marshall says it could just be a case of checking \u201cinside yourself to see if you are ready.\u201d Think about what you actually want from a relationship Perhaps it\u2019s not a new relationship you are after. \u201cIt could be that now is the time to climb Mount Kilimanjaro or to learn to play the banjo or whatever it is that is going to bring new energy into your life, rather than necessarily a new person,\u201d says Marshall. You may find you meet someone as a result of this new pursuit anyway. Perhaps you actually want a new friendship circle and revived social life, rather than a romantic partner. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding out what is right for you,\u201d says Cate Campbell, a relationship and psychosexual therapist. \u201cSome people have found an enormous amount of freedom in being single and getting into a relationship can take that away. What you want may also change over time.\u201d Let go of guilt It is understandable to feel guilty about getting into a new relationship after a bereavement. It\u2019s a big generalisation, says Campbell, \u201cbut men often want to be in another good relationship quickly, while women can feel guilty about moving on. Children, family and friends can be quite judgmental as well.\u201d Again, it comes back to: are you ready? You don\u2019t need to follow the script Sometimes, says Campbell, older clients \u201cwant to follow old-fashioned relationship trajectories. One thing that puts people off dating is the thought that they have got to move somebody in, or move the relationship along in the way that they would have when they were younger. You don\u2019t have to do that any more.\u201d Marriage or living together doesn\u2019t have to be the end-goal of a new relationship. \u201cI think it doesn\u2019t even occur to some people that they have choices. Once they realise they are in charge of their future, they are liberated.\u201d Join an app Apps have radically changed the dating landscape, but if you\u2019re new to it, Hemmings is reassuring. \u201cTechnologically, dating has changed, but the essence hasn\u2019t. You want to meet someone with whom you connect, who you find attractive, has a great sense of humour, shares your interests, is funny, kind \u2026\u201d Apps, she says, are \u201can opportunity, not something to fear\u201d. There is a broad range, from the traditional Match and Hinge (aimed at people looking for relationships) to Tinder and Grindr (more casual) to Bumble (where women make the first move in heterosexual pairings). There are also age-specific apps, such as OurTime which is run by Match, aimed at the over-50s. Enlist a friend Writing a dating profile is cringe-inducing, particularly the first few times you do it. Hemmings suggests getting a friend to describe you. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to become self-deprecating as we get older and undersell ourselves. And get a friend to take photos of you: your profile picture should be a nice one, smiling, where you look good, relaxed. Your other pictures could be holidays or things you might be doing with other people.\u201d Broaden your horizons \u201cBe realistic about what you want. Educational standards, political views; these are things that are pretty much settled by the time you\u2019re 60-plus,\u201d says Campbell. It\u2019s normal and desirable to have some non-negotiables, but try to be open-minded. Maybe you have such a narrow list of requirements \u201cthat nobody matches with you because you\u2019ve been too specific. Don\u2019t be overly judgmental.\u201d Talk first Relatively swift but not overly hasty is the rule when it comes to making a date \u2013 especially when you have connected via a website or app. With endless messages, says Hemmings, \u201cthere is the danger of becoming pen pals\u201d. After a few messages, it\u2019s a good idea to speak on the phone or do a video call. \u201cYou can infer a lot from somebody\u2019s voice \u2013 the tone, their humour, their character.\u201d Be clear on your boundaries \u201cDating makes you aware of all sorts of boundaries,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cWill you accept this behaviour or not? Are you happy to go out and have coffee with somebody who is going to be meeting another person for coffee an hour later?\u201d Don\u2019t feel as if you have to do something just because someone asks you, adds Campbell. Meeting for coffee or a short daytime date is better than dinner, says Hemmings, and have somewhere you need to be afterwards. \u201cIt adds to a sense of security, and takes away some of that fear \u2013 you know you have some boundaries in place before you go and that helps people relax.\u201d Are you exclusive? Dating apps have normalised the idea of seeing multiple people casually. It is perfectly possible that the person you are seeing regularly is also seeing other people, says Marshall, \u201cwithout feeling that they\u2019re doing anything unusual\u201d. Ask yourself if you are comfortable with this idea and be prepared to have a conversation about agreeing not to see other people (which may not go the way you want it to). Likewise, it\u2019s also fine to meet lots of people. \u201cYou should be honest, but treat them with respect,\u201d says Hemmings. If you want to end the date, or decide against meeting up in the first place, \u201cbe kind, but firm\u201d. If you are keen, be clear, advises Campbell. \u201cIt\u2019s no good trying to be coy because online, people will move on to someone else if you look as if you\u2019re not interested.\u201d Be open to meeting someone in real life You don\u2019t need to go near an app \u2013 the idea of meeting someone serendipitously isn\u2019t entirely extinct. Advice about starting a new hobby still stands. \u201cWhen you are doing something you love, you\u2019re more likely to be present and able to make an authentic connection with somebody,\u201d says Vicki Pavitt, a dating and relationship coach. Also, she adds, if you are a heterosexual woman and you\u2019re afraid to make the first move, ask yourself why. \u201cWe\u2019re now dropping those gendered scripts and embracing more of an equal approach.\u201d Practice being approachable Smile, says Pavitt. \u201cHave an openness in your body language, like smiling and making eye contact.\u201d It can help to have some ice-breaker comments or questions in mind \u201cif it\u2019s not a natural thing for you\u201d. Paying a genuine compliment is a good way to get a conversation started (but don\u2019t be creepy: \u201clook for reciprocity in how someone responds, and signs that someone is open to being approached, like a returned smile\u201d). Open-ended questions can help to encourage a meaningful response and you can improve social skills with practise. \u201cWhen you\u2019re getting a coffee, chat to people. If that is too much of a leap, just practice making eye contact. That can really help to flex that muscle of connection. Also let it be imperfect \u2013 don\u2019t put pressure on yourself to suddenly be this great conversationalist.\u201d Most importantly, practise listening. Listen to your children \u2013 but up to a point Teenage or even grownup children may be hostile to the idea of you dating. There can be legitimate, if slightly unsavoury, worries about inheritances, but often the bigger barriers are emotional, particularly, says Campbell, if they have already lost one parent \u201cthrough death, or if they\u2019ve moved away, or gone off with a new partner. They may fear losing the remaining parent. Sometimes children are unreasonable, but sometimes they are just frightened and they love you and want to be close to you. So listen to what they are saying, even if at the end of that you say: \u2018Actually, this is making me happy.\u2019\u201d Create a fulfilling sex life There can be many anxieties associated with a new sexual relationship, from body-image insecurities to concerns about sexual dysfunction, such as erectile problems or vaginal dryness and pain. Psychosexual and relationship therapist Lottie Passell-Syms sees it all. \u201cOne thing I ask [clients] to do is to stop criticising themselves,\u201d she says. If there is a loss of self-esteem and confidence, \u201cwhere has that message come from? It might be from your family, where you were not \u2018good enough\u2019. Can you accept yourself enough to be able to give yourself to somebody else?\u201d For physiological concerns, she suggests people see their GP, but adds many issues of sexual dysfunction can be psychological. \u201cIt could be shame, guilt, trauma or a specific incident.\u201d As we get older, there may have to be adjustments, such as using different positions, and don\u2019t expect what worked in a previous relationship to be the same in a new one. \u201cCommunication is the key to all of this,\u201d says Passell-Syms. \u201cJust because you like something or want something, it doesn\u2019t mean you can have it; you have got to have a conversation with the other person. We still need to put boundaries in place and say: \u2018I\u2019m not ready for this part of it.\u2019\u201d And if you are having sex, use condoms \u2013 rates of sexually transmitted infections among the over-65s are on the rise. Work on your confidence Separation, bereavement, long periods of being unhappily alone and hormonal changes can all sap confidence and, for some people, insecurities can grow with age. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have confidence, you need to ask yourself why,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cIf it\u2019s because you have always got by on your looks and now you\u2019re worried about the loss of that, then it is possibly time to find out what else you have to offer.\u201d Counselling might be useful, and being in a good place, mentally, will improve the chances of successful dating. \u201cUnderstand yourself better, so you can be more yourself rather than some jolly person that you send out with a mask on.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-01", "section": "Life and style", "author": "Emine Saner", "id": 488, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7a366db9bc73f5b5d0cf826998691f7e300eceb0/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Republicans seek to override Ohio governor\u2019s veto of trans rights bill", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/04/ohio-trans-law-veto-override", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.068, "neu": 0.731, "pos": 0.201, "compound": 0.9929}, "body": "A legislative showdown is brewing in Ohio after Governor Mike DeWine split from his party to veto a bill that would impose substantial new restrictions on the lives of trans children. The bill, HB 68, prohibits doctors from providing gender-affirming care to trans youths. It also blocks transgender female student athletes from participating in girls\u2019 sports. On Friday, DeWine said signing HB 68 into law would signal that \u201cthe government knows better what is medically best for a child than the two people who love that child the most: the parents\u201d. Ohio hospitals do not offer gender-affirming care to young patients without the consent of a parent or guardian. \u201cParents are making decisions about the most precious thing in their life, their child, and none of us should underestimate the gravity and the difficulty of those decisions,\u201d the governor said. \u201cMany parents have told me that their child would be dead today if they had not received the treatment they received from an Ohio children\u2019s hospital.\u201d The veto by DeWine, a Republican, marked a rare victory for LGBTQ+ advocates, who spent the past year battling a historic rise in anti-trans legislation and rhetoric across the United States. Maria Bruno, policy director for Equality Ohio, said the governor\u2019s veto was \u201ca relief for Ohio\u2019s transgender youth, parents, healthcare professionals and educators who can finally take a breath and get back to their lives\u201d. But that relief could be short-lived. Top Ohio Republicans, including the secretary of state, Frank LaRose, are now urging the state legislature to reverse the governor\u2019s decision by overriding his veto. \u201cWe have a duty to protect safety and fair competition for female athletes and to protect children from being subjected to permanent, life-altering medical procedures before the age of 18,\u201d LaRose said. The Republican speaker, Jason Stephens, announced this week that the Ohio house would reconvene on 10 January, weeks earlier than scheduled, in an attempt to revive the bill before the official start of the 2024 legislative session. Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers of the Ohio legislature, meaning Stephens\u2019 push to sidestep the governor is likely to succeed. \u201cIt is disappointing that the governor vetoed House Bill 68,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe bill sponsors, and the house, have dedicated nearly three years to get the bill right.\u201d Despite Stephens\u2019 insistence that HB 68 is a tool to \u201cempower parents and protect children,\u201d hundreds of Ohio families, including the parents of transgender children, have spoken out in fierce opposition to the GOP-backed proposal. Last year, the Ohio house received more than 600 written testimonies from people who oppose the ban on gender-affirming care, compared with just 56 in support of the legislation. In her testimony against the bill, Minna Zelch, the parent of a transgender daughter, asked why she and her husband \u201care qualified to make other medical decisions for our children, such as if they should have surgery for a broken bone or take ADHD medication, but we\u2019re not qualified to decide if and when they should receive gender care?\u201d Zelch added: \u201cAll transgender kids and their families deserve the basic right of deciding what medical care they receive.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-04", "section": "US news", "author": "Ava Sasani", "id": 489, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/499b597b0ab2aae0b27c64e049888b86dda4607b/0_39_6163_3700/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Too mild for fleeces?

Specifically, the group didn\u2019t care for how mild it has been \u2013 not good for shifting fleeces \u2013 although the same temperatures didn\u2019t seem to bother Next, which turned in its usual upgrades to forecasts. So the story probably lies in the other factors mentioned by JD. The group blamed \u201cmore cautious consumer spending\u201d and \u201can elevated level of promotional activity during the peak trading period\u201d. Possible translation: more and more punters think the entire \u2018athleisure\u2019 industry \u2013 from big brands such as Nike and Adidas, to the likes of JD itself \u2013 had elevated prices to silly levels. Who could blame them? When the retail price of the latest \u201cessential\u201d variation on an old line of Nike trainers is \u00a3175, more than a few would-be buyers may conclude that a purchase is actually inessential, or decide to wait until the product goes on sale. In the past, the industry has tended to dismiss such concerns as the fogeyish thinking of those who don\u2019t understand the must-have status of the buzzier fashion ranges. And it has usually been able to demonstrate its point: the hype machine in crossover sportswear is a wonder of modern marketing. Yet this Christmas season seems to have been marked by a mass outbreak of late discounting by big brands and retailers, with JD obliged to join in. The intriguing aspect is that JD\u2019s profits warning, like Nike\u2019s before Christmas, comes at a moment when the trading backdrop wasn\u2019t obviously unhelpful. Overall employment levels, it used to be said, dictate the real incomes of the core 16 to 24-year-old target market and, on that front in the UK at least, there isn\u2019t a problem, notwithstanding wider cost-of-living pressures. As recently as late-September, JD said it expected headline pre-tax profits for this financial year to arrive at \u00a31.04bn, so the latest prediction of \u00a3915m-\u00a3935m represents a \u00a3100m-plus gap that has appeared over the peak season. That\u2019s chunky. JD could still report a 1.8% improvement in like-for-like revenues in the last five months of 2023 and, with the contribution from new stores, overall revenues should still be 8% higher over the course of a financial year that closes in early February. This is still a growth company making a very substantial profit and enjoying the benefit of a diversified revenue base that is split roughly evenly between the UK, the rest of Europe and the US. Nor is JD\u2019s closeness to major brands, and thus its ability to get sweetheart access to the top lines, about to disappear. Yet the 23% slump in the share price still looks rational. There is a new uncertainty here. Has the industry\u2019s phenomenal ability to crank the fashion handle and maintain pricing power reached a natural ceiling for now? JD didn\u2019t venture a forecast for the 2024-25 year.

Lancashire\u2019s performance as the chef and author Julia Child is one of this arch, twinkly show\u2019s main draws, but by the time we rejoin her in season two, her TV show The French Chef has triumphed over the odds, making her a star, so now the drama must find other sources of tension. Franco-American disagreements about what constitutes a cassoulet seem as good a place to start as any. Julia is a rich and highly stylised show, which lingers as lovingly on its dialogue as it does on food. It begins its second outing with a lengthy period of separation for the bulk of the cast, dividing its time between France, where Julia and Paul (David Hyde Pierce, a perfect match for Lancashire) have escaped the madness of fame, and Boston, where the 1960s explosion in popular culture is picked over and mined for drama, from the sexism of the TV world to the power dynamics of book publishing, via several diversions to the anti-Vietnam war movement. France offers the more sumptuous scenes, and initially, Julia is best when it lingers there. Julia is researching her next book with teacher and friend Simone \u201cSimca\u201d Beck (Rossellini). \u201cIt is good to have industrious wives,\u201d notes Simca\u2019s husband, Jean, to Paul, as they sip drinks on deckchairs in the garden.

Julia is reluctant to return to the US to face the music, so Judith and eventually Avis (Bebe Neuwirth) are sent over to hurry things along. A little hurrying along is surely necessary. The pace, to start with, is gentle, and as viewers, we are Paul and Jean, lounging in the garden, waiting for the main course to be served up. It leaves the impression that it is spreading itself thinly, particularly in Boston. Director Russ (Fran Kranz) is now trying to make it in the world of documentaries. Network bossHunter (Robert Joy), having produced a hit, finds himself under extra pressure, both to manage his hit effectively and to produce even more of them. But its main concerns are the women. Producer Alice (Brittany Bradford) is having to do her own job, despite not knowing when her French Chef will return, as well as helping the men with their roles, while taking the blame for Hunter\u2019s terrible ideas and being denied access to the big decisions. Russ is replaced by a female director, Elaine (Rachel Bloom), who has fled the more successful CBS and must fend off the unwelcome advances of her colleagues. Meanwhile Judith must pick up the slack for the ailing Blanche, while not appearing to undermine her boss. Can they have it all? What would Betty Friedan think? Julia occasionally forgets to be subtle. Episode one ends with Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are a-Changin\u2019, just in case the message wasn\u2019t loud enough, and the voice of the modern day sometimes creeps in. Hunter is desperate for \u201cnew content, yesterday!\u201d, while Alice is \u201cone girl, in a sea of men\u201d. It takes a little too long to rev up, and there is a sense that the early episodes have overloaded plates, which leads to less Julia on screen. Without her, the story feels adrift. It isn\u2019t until the fourth episode that the old gang are finally brought back together. When it plumps for acid over sugar, however, it finds its form. Stockard Channing makes a brief, bright appearance as Frannie, an oil heiress from Ohio, travelling with chef and author James Beard, who is surprised when a dish of his own arrives at the house. At a fractious dinner, where the guests are supposed to adjudicate between the warring Julia and Simca by voting for the food they like best, Frannie delivers a wonderfully spiky speech about dependence and what it means to be \u201ckept\u201d by another person, laying the foundations for marital disruption. Simca, meanwhile, cannot abide Julia\u2019s Americanised tweaks of the French classics. \u201cI love her like my sister,\u201d she declares. \u201cYou hate your sister,\u201d Jean reminds her. Julia is a uniquely indulgent watch, erudite and gorgeous and heady. It isn\u2019t without its flaws: season two needs more Julia, and it takes its time to work on the winning recipe, but it is such a warm pleasure that it\u2019s easy to simply sink in to its richness, pastry fish and all. \u2022 Julia is on Sky Atlantic and Now in the UK and on Binge in Australia", "date": "2024-01-04", "section": "Television & radio", "author": "Rebecca Nicholson", "id": 491, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/856591ea285f2adfe91d042c620f1e5e04f652ef/0_104_7008_4205/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Do the Golden Globes still matter?

A boycott by stars and their publicists following years of scandal came to a head when it became evident not one of the voters was Black. Celebrities refused to attend and broadcasters to cooperate. The ceremony was held behind closed doors. No press. No red carpet. No impact. At the time, the general reaction was: good riddance. What merit was there in being celebrated by such a discredited society? And isn\u2019t all that hoopla a bit distasteful in the age of Covid? A year later, and the stars and cameras flooded enthusiastically back, lapping up a ceremony of gongs, glamour and endless mea culpas via a host \u2013 Jerrod Carmichael \u2013 who readily confessed he\u2019d been hired as a conspicuous symbol of the organisation\u2019s overhaul. Why the U-turn? Had everyone been satisfied by the Globes\u2019 admission of error and hiring a handful of diverse new voters? Perhaps. Also possible is that Hollywood noticed that without this raucous youngster to kick off proceedings, awards season lost a lot of its energy. Momentum sputtered. Actors missed out on the chance to \u201caudition\u201d for those more prestigious gongs still being voted on \u2013 either by frocks, charm or assuming a role as an unfairly snubbed loser. Marketing opportunities for movies still in cinemas were lost. The film industry might not respect the Golden Globes, but it didn\u2019t know what it had until it was nearly gone. So the awards\u2019 unreliability as an indication of quality is no longer of concern. Nor is its increasing shakiness as a bellwether of Oscars success. Last year, only three of the 14 Golden Globe film category winners went on to pick up Oscars: best animation Pinocchio, and Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019s Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. And while that film swept the Academy Awards, the titles that won the Golden Globes\u2019 best film trophies \u2013 The Banshees of Inisherin (best comedy or musical) and The Fabelmans (best drama) \u2013 went home from the Oscars empty-handed. So, Hollywood has reconciled with the Globes\u2019 lack of class and, potentially, taste? The benefits of attending still outweigh the embarrassments. Such a shift in thinking can perhaps be best illustrated by comparing what happened when each body made a blatant play for the mainstream. In 2018, the Academy introduced a new category recognising \u201cpopular\u201d movies, with hefty box office an eligibility requirement. So ferocious was the backlash, which many cited as evidence of selling out to superhero culture, plans were abandoned less than a month after being announced. This year\u2019s Globes will see the presentation of the inaugural award for cinematic and box office achievement for films grossing at least $100m (\u00a379m) domestically and $150m internationally. The new prize was announced last September. Nobody batted an eyelid.

Will Fransen, 61, had set off on a solo fishing trip from Whangamat\u0101 on the Coromandel Peninsula, south of Auckland, on 2 January, but was yanked overboard after hooking what he suspected was a marlin. He was unable to catch his idling 12-metre boat as it floated away, and was dragged by currents as he tried to swim to the Alderman Islands. Whangamat\u0101 police sergeant Will Hamilton said it was an \u201cabsolute miracle\u201d the man was still alive after the ordeal. Fransen told the New Zealand Herald he was \u201cpessimistic\u201d of his chances of survival. \u201cI grabbed the line with the marlin attached and started pulling the line out. I tried pulling my way towards the boat only to have the line slip out of my hand, which is pretty gutting, because next thing my boat\u2019s idling over the horizon and I\u2019m treading water. \u201cWhen I went in the water I knew the chances of somebody even knowing I was in the water were pretty slim. I was pretty pessimistic from the outset,\u201d he said. \u201cI just kept staying alive.\u201d Fransen was too exhausted to keep swimming, so endured a cold and difficult night in the water, at one point seeing a shark coming close and having \u201ca sniff\u201d before swimming off. \u201cI gave up and just treaded water and watched the beautiful sunset overhead,\u201d he said. The angler was saved the next day when the three fishers noticed a reflection in the water and went over in their boat to investigate. They found the exhausted and desperate man in the waters off Mayor Island, after he attemped to catch their attention by using the reflection of the sun from his watch. Hamilton said he was taken back to Whangamat\u0101 and treated for hypothermia and exhaustion. \u201cIt is an absolute miracle the fisherman is still alive after the ordeal. Without the quick actions of the three gentlemen that retrieved him, this certainly would have had a tragic outcome,\u201d Hamilton said. He thanked the fishers for saving the man\u2019s life, and added that authorities were still looking for his boat. \u201cThe boaties did an absolute stellar job and without a doubt saved this man\u2019s life. \u201cFew stories end the way this one did, and police cannot thank the eagle-eyed trio enough for making the call to investigate something that looked out of the ordinary. \u201cThe boat may be missing, but the fisherman still has his watch,\u201d Hamilton added. Rescuer James Mcdonnell told Newshub a \u201cseries of fortunate events\u201d led them to see the watch \u201cglistening, probably 600 metres away\u201d. \u201cI mean, we were 10 miles [16km] off the back of Mayor Island and not a boat in sight, but sure enough, as we got closer, it was quite obvious that someone was waving their arms,\u201d he said. Rescue boat skipper Max White said their priority was to get the man aboard and to keep him awake. \u201cWe had a big cooler bag and just wrapped him up in as many layers as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s desperate for water \u2026 so I had a bit of warm water on the boat and some cranberry juice \u2026 Give him what we can and try and get him talking and just make sure that he stayed awake as best possible.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-05", "section": "World news", "author": "Mostafa Rachwani", "id": 493, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/545d3f4983710a2178dd69de8cad94d507734742/0_72_2160_1296/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Houseplant of the week: Caladium \u2018Pink Beauty\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/05/houseplant-of-the-week-caladium-pink-beauty", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.029, "neu": 0.723, "pos": 0.249, "compound": 0.9847}, "body": "Why will I love it?

It could be a joke but, given that the comedian and TV writer once turned a sex scene into a fantasy about a Tesco meal deal, and wrote another about someone pooing their bed, a prop room awash with sex toys sounds about right. He\u2019s here filming the second season of his coming-of-age autobiographical comedy, Big Boys, which follows gay student Jack (Dylan Llewellyn) and his straight best friend Danny (Jon Pointing). The blue shed that Jack and Danny live in is literally a big blue shed in real life, based on the guardianship buildings Rooke lived in after university. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice because my mum lives around the corner,\u201d says Rooke, who is proud to put his home town on the map. \u201cSitcoms thrive outside cities \u2013 look at The Office.\u201d The dismal set might not scream inspiration, but spend a few hours with the cast and it\u2019s clear they have enough warmth and gags to make magic happen anywhere. \u201cWe are like a family,\u201d says Camille Coduri, who plays Jack\u2019s mum Peggy and becomes a matriarch to Danny. She can\u2019t stop cuddling and cooing over Pointing, with whom she stops for a chat at lunch. So genuine is this bond, Coduri recalls that when the cast went to LGBTQ+ festival Mighty Hoopla to introduce Kelly Rowland on stage, she let Llewellyn stay at her own son\u2019s house for the weekend. \u201cHe\u2019s so nerdy isn\u2019t he?\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m very fond of them all.\u201d No wonder this lovely lot have charmed so many fans, earned Bafta nominations and won best sitcom at the Writers\u2019 Guild of Great Britain awards. Based on Rooke\u2019s Edinburgh fringe show and book Cheer the Fuck Up, it follows Jack\u2019s experience of grieving his dad, coming out to his mum, going to uni and making an unlikely friendship with lads\u2019 lad Danny, who, behind the banter, struggles with depression and family estrangement. In real life, Rooke\u2019s best mate killed himself. But at the end of the first series, a tearjerking letter soothes Danny, who decides to accept help from Jack and stay with his family for the summer. \u201cI\u2019m writing Big Boys for people who have gone \u2018I wish I\u2019d said that at that time\u2019,\u201d says Rooke. \u201cIt\u2019s me writing in hindsight.\u201d If this sounds heavy, that\u2019s because at times it is \u2013 and how refreshing to see men\u2019s mental health explored so freely. But for every weepy moment, there\u2019s a raucous gag to make you spit out your tea (like the moment a student union rep confuses ISIS with ASOS). It\u2019s also loaded with fun 00s pop culture references \u2013 a love letter to a time when Alison Hammond did Strictly, Holly and Phil ruled daytime TV and the \u201cLive, Laugh, Love\u201d sign was everywhere. Season two picks up straight after the first: Danny and Peggy have been smoking weed together all summer, and Jack is determined to live his new life as a confidently gay man. \u201cI\u2019ve finally come out but my sex life is still a disaster,\u201d he puffs after being poked in the eye by a pub DJ\u2019s penis in the loo. Danny, meanwhile, wants to be with on/off love interest Corrine (Scottish Bafta-winner Izuka Hoyle), but now that he\u2019s got his erection back, he also just \u201cloves the puss\u201d. After failing to find a new house together, they cram back into the blue shed ready for another turbulent year at uni. When I meet up with the gang again a few weeks ahead of the show\u2019s release, there\u2019s no sign of second album nerves. \u201cMe and Phoebe Waller-Bridge have just been texting,\u201d says Rooke casually, followed by a knowing laugh of disbelief. \u201cShe just asked me to write a play for her.\u201d Waller-Bridge is not the only famous fan. Russell T Davies was so impressed that he contacted Rooke and spoke with him over FaceTime to help go through his contract. \u201cHe\u2019s so kind and generous.\u201d Richard Curtis also invited him to dinner to ask for help producing a project, while Derry Girls creator Lisa McGee has become a mentor. Self Esteem singer Rebecca Lucy Taylor is a great friend too, and gave him the advice: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop fucking putting success down. You fucking won an award.\u201d But the personal hero that topped them all? \u201cWhen Kathy Burke tweeted about the show, I just took the day off.\u201d Llewellyn had already enjoyed a taste of this sort of success after his breakout role as \u201cwee English fella\u201d James in Derry Girls. At last year\u2019s Baftas, the next level of fame really hit when he had to choose which of his two nominated shows\u2019 tables to sit at (he chose Derry Girls, who won, but joined the Big Boys lot for dessert). \u201cSometimes I do forget that I am an actor,\u201d he says, in his very unassuming way. \u201cWhen someone stares at me I\u2019m like \u2018What are you looking at?\u2019 I do freak myself out.\u201d The real pinch-me moment, though, was when Big Boys featured on the Gogglebox Pride special: \u201cSeeing Rylan and H from Steps react to Jack\u2019s coming out scene and how much it meant to them? It was really beautiful.\u201d Llewellyn was first introduced to Rooke by their mutual friend Nicola Coughlan after his comedy show. How did it feel later auditioning to play his mate\u2019s mate? \u201cJack is a very light-up-the-room person,\u201d he says. But, despite sharing the same curly mop of hair, he takes on a certain version of him: \u201cMy Jack is still trying to come out of his shell, you know, and it\u2019s when he was younger and trying to discover himself and be comfortable.\u201d There\u2019s a clear mutual respect between the pair, with Rooke calling Llewellyn the hardest working person there because his dyslexia means he needs to spend more time with the scripts. \u201cI do find it tough when there\u2019s a fresh draft and we need to shoot the day after,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cBut it\u2019s a very safe space. It always works out because everyone\u2019s just looking out for each other.\u201d Pointing, who started out as a standup, met Rooke on the comedy circuit nearly seven years ago, and they bonded in a kebab shop. \u201cYou know when you meet someone and you feel like \u2018Oh, I\u2019m home\u2019?\u201d he remembers. They immediately started talking about developing Rooke\u2019s series. \u201cLook, how many times have I been half cut and some other performer or writer has said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this idea for a show\u2019?\u201d But Rooke realised he had found his perfect \u201cstraight mate\u201d Danny. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I was exactly like his friend,\u201d says Pointing. \u201cBut I think he saw something in me.\u201d The success of playing Danny \u2013 along with his compelling blend of deadpan wit and laddish charm (enough to make an interviewer burst into a five-minute laughing fit with a sarcastic comment on how the \u201cstraight male community\u201d isn\u2019t represented enough) \u2013 has boosted Pointing\u2019s career over the last two years. He starred in the BBC\u2019s recent Agatha Christie adaptation, and won hearts as a single dad looking for love in Sky Comedy\u2019s modern romcom Smothered. He and Llewellyn are almost in danger of being typecast as really lovely blokes. Would they ever play the villain? \u201cYeah sure!\u201d says Pointing. \u201cI used to do a really unpleasant person in my comedy. But I\u2019d look around the room and think \u2018Oh I\u2019ve just ruined everyone\u2019s evening.\u2019\u201d Llewellyn, meanwhile, would just \u201clove to play an adult\u201d and for people to say \u201c\u2018What the hell? But that\u2019s the Wee English Fella!\u2019\u201d What he\u2019s most keen on, though, is to work with McGee again on a soppy romcom. Beyond these triumphs, the most meaningful thing to happen to the boys is the open-arms response from not just the LGBTQ+ community but also straight men who have taken something positive from the show. \u201cThe most important thing is when someone\u2019s like, \u2018My husband\u2019s a builder and he loves Danny!\u2019\u201d says Rooke. It\u2019s a big middle finger to the commissioners who rejected Big Boys because they would ask, \u201cDo we believe this gay guy would have this straight best friend?\u201d Pointing adds that, while there are lots of posters on the tube and in pubs these days about men\u2019s mental health, many still don\u2019t know how to articulate it. \u201cMaybe the show helps a little bit.\u201d How about a third season, then? Everyone is keen, obviously \u2013 Rooke even admits that he\u2019s obsessed with the ratings figures. \u201cMy aim is [like] Gavin and Stacey vibes. I want a huge span: that\u2019s my dream.\u201d Then again, after turning 30 last year, he also says he has \u201cmilked this story\u201d to death. He\u2019d like to focus on writing characters inspired by the working-class women in his life. He adores his mum \u2013 who always believed in him but also prepared him for working-class failure in a very middle-class industry \u2013 and says the best thing about all of this is that he\u2019s finally been able to buy her a fridge. \u201cShe\u2019s got like three framed Bafta-nominee posters on the wall at home. I can just tell that for her, it\u2019s the best thing.\u201d There\u2019s only one disappointing thing about this second season: no one has yet met Alison Hammond, who Jack\u2019s goldfish was named after. \u201cI don\u2019t think she likes it,\u201d says Rooke. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine she would. I think it would be weird being written up in a sitcom as a fish.\u201d Series two of Big Boys starts on Channel 4 on 14 January.

The six actors join the season one star Natasha Rothwell, whom Variety confirmed would reprise her Emmy-nominated role as the beleaguered luxury hotel masseuse Belinda back in April 2023. Exact plot details for the third season, set to begin production in Thailand in February, are being kept under wraps, although it is expected the new outing will again follow a set of guests at a different fictional White Lotus hotel property. The creator, writer and director Mike White will again serve as executive producer and director, along with David Bernad and Mark Kamine as executive producers. White has previously teased that the third season will delve into eastern spirituality, potentially aligning with Belinda\u2019s interest in wellness. \u201cThe first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,\u201d White said in an HBO clip tied to the season 2 finale. \u201cI think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and eastern religion and spirituality.\u201d Rothwell, recently seen in Wonka, has already teased a surprising season in-store. \u201cI gasped out loud a minimum of five times, and this was just me reading them,\u201d she told Vanity Fair last month. \u201cThe scripts are a testament to Mike\u2019s skill and ability to tell the most smart and entertaining stories.\u201d HBO has partnered with the Tourism Authority of Thailand to support filming and promotion of the third season. \u201cWe are pleased to partner with the Tourism Authority of Thailand to execute Mike\u2019s creative vision and showcase all that the beautiful country of Thailand has to offer, as the next group of guests check in to the White Lotus,\u201d said Janet Graham Borba, executive vice-president of production for HBO and Max, in a statement reported by Variety. Thailand has long been considered one of the world\u2019s favorite filming locations,\u201d added Thapanee Kiatphaibool, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. \u201cThe White Lotus project will certainly strengthen the kingdom\u2019s status as a preferred filming destination and a beacon of experience-based tourism, inspiring even more visitors to amazing Thailand.\u201d The White Lotus was an instant critical hit since its debut in 2021 as a limited series \u2013 its first season, set in Hawaii, earned 20 Emmy nominations and 10 wins, including for best limited series.

She was so affectionate and always greeted me when I came home. Her loss affected me massively when she passed away in February last year. I loved her throughout her whole life, but she was particularly sweet in her later years. I thought to myself: when I have my own place, I\u2019ll adopt old cats to make sure they don\u2019t stay in cages at the end of their life. Last summer, I finally got my own flat in London and was ready to adopt. I came across a cat named Flossie through Cats Protection, a charity dedicated to rescuing and rehoming stray, unwanted or homeless animals. The website said she was a 27-year-old tortoiseshell. At the time, I thought it was an error and that she must be 17. Cats Protection told me she was still available to adopt and that no, she was in fact 27, the same age as me. It is weird to think that Flossie and I were born in the same year. When I adopted her, I thought she\u2019d only have a few months left, but felt comforted by the fact that she\u2019d at least spend them in a nice, warm flat, be fed well and get treats as well as a comfy bed. I wanted her to roam around and get the attention she deserved. To my surprise, I\u2019ve had her for over a year now and she\u2019s still going strong. Her birthday is 29 December, so she has just turned 28. Flossie is a small indoor cat who always wants attention. She\u2019s very friendly and will sit on anyone\u2019s lap straight away. The balcony is her sanctuary, especially when it\u2019s sunny. Though we\u2019re the same age, she\u2019s still my baby. She\u2019s my child, my best friend, my family. I come home and she\u2019s always there. She has her routine: waking up and loudly meowing at six in the morning for her breakfast, going for a nap, waking up again for some afternoon snacks and then having more naps. There are a few special toys she likes to play with. As soon as I get into bed, she climbs on my chest and then falls asleep on my lap. After a little nap on me, she\u2019ll move down near my feet for the rest of the night. I think she\u2019s lived so long primarily due to luck, and because she was loved by her previous owners. She does have a special diet now, but she\u2019s still very active \u2013 as active as you can be at her age. I bought her little stairs to get up on the sofa, but she hasn\u2019t used them at all; she still jumps everywhere. I found out Flossie was the world\u2019s oldest living cat when someone from Cats Protection later messaged me to say that they thought she might be. They had received vet\u2019s records confirming she was actually born in December 1995. I was surprised, but didn\u2019t think it would be as big a deal as it turned out to be. Guinness World Records came around to take pictures. A week later, pictures of me and Flossie were everywhere, and resulted in some lovely responses. A gentleman painted a picture of Flossie and sent it to Cats Protection, who forwarded it to me; he included a little toy mouse and some treats too. One of the most surreal and special moments was sitting on the sofa with Flossie and watching ourselves on TV. Obviously, she had no clue what was going on, but it was fun to sit next to her and think, \u201cThat\u2019s us on there!\u201d I also made a speech at the Cats Protection awards ceremony in her honour \u2013 another thing I never thought I\u2019d do. I told the audience it was heartwarming to know that more senior cats aren\u2019t being overlooked, and have nice retirement homes to go to. There are, of course, challenges to having an ageing cat; not only is she deaf, but she is also partially sighted. Yet she\u2019s been so easy to look after. The biggest difficulty is dealing with the fact that there may soon come a time when she passes. I\u2019m in denial about that. I look at her and just think she doesn\u2019t look old at all. Yet who knows? She could well be on the way to becoming the oldest cat in history. Though even if she doesn\u2019t break the current record of 38 years and three days, at least I\u2019ll know she had a great retirement home. \u2022 As told to Diyora Shadijanova Do you have an experience to share?

Last year the best was, without doubt, Matthew Parker\u2019s One Fine Day. It was such a great idea to tell this complex history through the prism of one day in 1923, when the British empire hit its peak. Doing so meant he was immediately freed from the inane \u201cbalance sheet\u201d view that has British historians forever listing the positives and negatives of the enterprise. What emerges instead is a nuanced and readable book. But reading so much history I sometimes forget that I\u2019ve also written a novel, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ve lost my tendency to think and write creatively. So next year I want to focus on stuff that is fun; books that aren\u2019t about the British empire, genocide or colonisation. I want to focus on human stories that entertain me and amuse me, and maybe get some light in my life. The first one is The Bee Sting by Paul Murray. It\u2019s a comic novel set in Ireland. Everyone\u2019s going on about it, and I feel like I\u2019m missing out. I also want to read You Are Here by David Nicholls, out in spring. I think he\u2019s the funniest writer around and incredibly insightful about people. I would also like to try Charles Dickens. I\u2019ve never read him properly; I took against him at university. The times I\u2019ve picked him up I\u2019ve found him prolix and hard to get into. The closest I\u2019ve got is watching The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is very good, but it didn\u2019t make me want to read the book. However, last year, Nick Hornby\u2019s Dickens and Prince: A Particular Kind of Genius really opened my eyes because I\u2019m a massive Prince fan, and it made me rethink Dickens \u2013 maybe I was being ignorant in not reading him. So I\u2019m either going to read Great Expectations or A Tale of Two Cities. I\u2019m slightly put off by the latter because I saw an adaptation of it, which was a four-hour monstrosity set outdoors \u2013 it made me want to die. I think I\u2019ll go for Great Expectations, it seems accessible. Another on my reading list for later in 2024 is Welcome to Glorious Tuga by Francesca Segal. It\u2019s about a woman who tries to escape her life in London by going to study tortoises on a faraway island. So it taps into that fantasy, that desire to escape that I think we\u2019ve all had since Covid. As told to Ella Creamer. Empireworld: How British Imperialism Has Shaped the Globe by Sathnam Sanghera will be published on 25 January \u2018I want to read remarkable stories of ancient lands\u2019 Elif Shafak I am preparing an eclectic reading list guided by the flow of rivers. This year I have been working on my new novel There Are Rivers in the Sky. Writing about rivers and floods, immersing myself in the mysteries of water, made me appreciate how connected we all are across borders. Mexico\u2019s famous R\u00edo Secreto and many underground rivers remind me that I need to read more Mexican authors, especially Valeria Luiselli, Laura Esquivel, Fernando del Paso, Yuri Herrera and the Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros. South Korea fascinates me in so many ways. The restoration of the River Cheonggyecheon, a great example of daylighting \u2013 the practice of uncovering a buried waterway \u2013 has inspired me to learn more about Korean literature and culture, and so I will be reading Kyung-sook Shin, Bae Suah and more of Han Kang. Buried Saharan rivers, ancestors\u2019 tracks, now mostly dried up or forgotten, will guide me towards the remarkable stories of other ancient lands. I want to learn more from the literatures of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Sudan. Bensalem Himmich, Laila Lalami, Le\u00efla Slimani, Tahar ben Jelloun. Also, Yasmina Khadra, Leila Aboulela, Ahdaf Soueif, Alaa al-Aswany, Muhammad Aladdin, Rania Mamoun, Jamal Mahjoub, Hisham Matar and the Sudanese-born writer Nesrine Malik. I will also be rereading Assia Djebar and Albert Camus this year, as I feel like their remarkable intelligence sheds light on our troubled times. The slow death of Zimbabwean rivers, just like the painful demise of the Tigris and the Euphrates, makes me more eager to read authors from or around the region. I will especially focus on Tsitsi Dangarembga, NoViolet Bulawayo, Petina Gappah and Alexandra Fuller. It is a large and heterogeneous collection, a diverse reading list that grows by the week, guided by the flow of rivers \u2013 those that are still with us and those that we have lost. There Are Rivers in the Sky by Elif Shafak will be published by Viking in August \u2018My list includes books about WG Sebald, Jean Rhys and James Baldwin\u2019 Sarah Waters I\u2019ve always loved reading about authors\u2019 lives, in the form of biographies, diaries and memoirs. But I\u2019ve rather dropped the habit, and plan to rekindle it in 2024. Luckily, there are some terrific looking books to get me back in the groove. First on my list is Carole Angier\u2019s biography of WG Sebald, Speak, Silence. I find Sebald\u2019s books mesmerising, with their brooding meditation on memory, exile and trauma, and their disconcerting blurring of the lines between fact and fiction. His life seems to have been similarly enigmatic, and, by all accounts, Angier has done a remarkable job of delving through layers of reticence and obfuscation to get to the troubled essence of the man and his work. Next, another rather slippery character, in the form of TS Eliot. One of my best reads last year was Erica Wagner\u2019s Mary and Mr Eliot, which explores the fascinating relationship between Eliot and his close friend Mary Trevelyan \u2013 and incidentally exposes what a self-centred bastard he was. So I\u2019m looking forward to Lyndall Gordon\u2019s The Hyacinth Girl, a study of another of the remarkable women in Eliot\u2019s life, his American muse and confidante, Emily Hale. Then there\u2019s Miranda Seymour\u2019s I Used to Live Here Once, a new biography of Jean Rhys. I\u2019m familiar with some of the details of Rhys\u2019s extraordinary, rackety life, which featured periods of exile, heartbreak, alcoholism and literary obscurity. But I know hardly anything about her Caribbean childhood, and nothing about the writing process that produced masterpieces like Wide Sargasso Sea and Good Morning, Midnight. So I\u2019m excited by the prospect of reading Seymour\u2019s book, which promises to supply all that and much more. An almost exact contemporary of Rhys\u2019s was the novelist and journalist Storm Jameson, and I\u2019m delighted to see that Pushkin will soon be reprinting her 1969 autobiography, Journey from the North. Born in Whitby, Yorkshire, in 1891, Jameson wrote more than 50 books, was active in socialist and pacifist politics, and worked prominently for English PEN, helping refugee writers and their families escape from Nazi-occupied Europe. She was a sensitive, forthright, hugely likable writer, and, as with many 20th-century female authors, deserves to be more widely known. And, finally, another author whose life and career intertwined with political upheavals and radical social change: James Baldwin. Baldwin was a brilliant chronicler of African American life, and his essays are among some of the finest ever written, with a trenchant understanding of the complicated intersections of race, class and sexuality. Giovanni\u2019s Room, his groundbreaking novel from 1956, is a beautiful, blistering depiction of gay male desire. I\u2019d love to know more about his influences, his early years and his civil rights activism \u2013 so will turn with great pleasure to a new biography by Bill V Mullen, James Baldwin: Living in Fire. Sarah Waters\u2019 novels include Fingersmith and most recently The Paying Guests, published by Virago \u2018I\u2019m turning to sci-fi and dystopia\u2019 Sheena Patel I have a fascination with sci-fi that is purely theoretical. I often think about reading it but never make any attempt to go near such books because I am afraid of the imagination I will find there. Perhaps I haven\u2019t felt I can really access the genre because sci-fi feels like what Black and Brown people can go through on a daily basis. We\u2019re still in an age of empire, even though we are distracted from this knowledge. I do love sci-fi films though. I had a true epiphany when I saw Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Under the Skin at the cinema. It was so strange, the alien mixed with the mundane, documentary spliced with fantastical set pieces. Next year I think I will read the Michel Faber book from which the movie was adapted. In 2024 I also want to tackle Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune books. Earlier this year, I watched the film on my laptop maybe 50 times. At first, I hated it, but then I totally fell in love with it \u2013 the visual representation of different worlds opened my mind. Throat singing and nomadic desert tribes could be used as a mood board for the future, but this is already happening now in communities that are regarded as \u201cprimitive\u201d. It is the future because it is eternal \u2013 such a beautiful thought. We are fed so much dystopia that reading it in fiction feels hard \u2013 but, as the world burns, maybe it is a good idea to hear from artists about where we might be heading. So the other three titles I will try are classics: Octavia E Butler\u2019s Kindred, Stanis\u0142aw Lem\u2019s Solaris and The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin. The present feels so bleak, and our vision of the future so foreshortened, it almost seems like tempting fate \u2013 but, without science fiction, how can we dream? I\u2019m a Fan by Sheena Patel is published in paperback by Granta \u2018I\u2019d like to tackle more fiction in translation\u2019 Benjamin Myers Winter is the best time for fiction, a season in which I am drawn to all things old, or weird, so 2023 started with a series of big names that I\u2019d previously avoided: The Sea, the Sea by Iris Murdoch, which pulled me in and spat me out; the deep dive into time and place of Waterland by Graham Swift; and the perfectly succinct Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. The Ice Palace by Tarjei Vesaas reminded me that certain Scandinavian literature speaks to me in ways I can\u2019t fully articulate. Perhaps it is the Viking blood that a recent DNA test revealed I have within me. The Birds by Vesaas achieved an astonishing trick with a narrative voice that almost made me want to give up writing entirely. Almost. I also found comfort in retreating back into a 20th-century England of fried breakfasts, furtive sexual encounters and infrequent bathing via The Bloater by Rosemary Tonks, The Glass Pearls by Emeric Pressburger, The Children of Dynmouth by William Trevor and The Slaves of Solitude by Patrick Hamilton. A new discovery was Love, Leda by Mark Hyatt, a bisexual, occasionally homeless and often brilliant poet, who died by his own hand in a cave near Blackburn in Lancashire. I slumped in the summer, but, with winter here again, the fire is lit and the fiction tower is wobbling. I\u2019d like to tackle more literature in translation. I\u2019ve yet to read Olga Tokarczuk or Lucas Rijneveld, and have an entire Halld\u00f3r Laxness backlist winking at me. I often remember a Richard Brautigan character who is reading \u201cthe Russians\u201d and think I really should do the same. But then, resolutions are for breaking, and with Ireland seemingly producing an amazing new novel every fortnight, The Heart in Winter by Kevin Barry or Wild Houses by Colin Barrett will, I suspect, provide pure reading pleasure as we ease into spring. Two other novels have been patiently waiting for me to pick them up for several years now: Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry and Beyond Black by Hilary Mantel. Perhaps the time has come. Cuddy by Benjamin Myers won the 2023 Goldsmiths prize and is out in paperback by Bloomsbury on 1 February \u2018I\u2019ll try to meet up with the Latin poets I studied\u2019 Sebastian Barry My degree was in ancient and modern literature. Next year I might try to start again into the lovely thickets of Virgil\u2019s Aeneid, if I can drum up the courage and strength. I did a degree called ancient and modern literature, and the ancient part of it was Latin. Although I was the worst, or at least the slowest, reader of Virgil in the history of students struggling with spondees and dactyls, I still believe it did me infinite good, as whatever sort of writer I ended up, to make the attempt. I am sure many people who have been through university have that curious bookshelf in their later houses that are the texts \u2013 never reread, gathering the dust of decades \u2013 from those old campaigns to survive their degrees. I certainly do. All those red-jacketed Loeb classics, even a few green ones denoting Greek, which I never penetrated. I have a lovely, genius friend called Daniel Mendelsohn, a famous classicist, who told me recently he was going again through the rabbinical texts for the love of it. Well! I think he told me that when he first looked into Greek, another of his acquisitions, as a child, he could more or less intuit the shape and the sense of it, knew the essence and atmosphere of it instinctively. I possess no such assistance from a sluggish brain. But I thought next year I might try to meet up with Propertius again, and perpetually modern Catullus (who died so young), and Horace of the Satires rather than the Odes, although I am probably old enough for the Odes now, God knows. And Plautus, and maybe Terence, who didn\u2019t teach me much about playwriting, maybe, but did indicate that demotic writing existed 2,000 years before television. Old God\u2019s Time by Sebastian Barry will be published in paperback by Faber on 1 February \u2018I\u2019m craving the immersive experience that a long book provides\u2019 Cecile Pin I keep tab of my reading on my Notes app. This past year has been a bit eclectic: I read eight books in August, and only one the next month. I favoured fiction, with quite a few Greek myths, classics or retellings in the first half of the year, and debuts throughout. I especially loved Fire Rush by Jacqueline Crooks and Nothing Special by Nicole Flattery. There was also some poetry (Louise Gl\u00fcck and Anne Carson), and a few science books, mostly research for my next novel. One detail stands out: almost all the books I\u2019ve read sit under 300 pages, and I know that\u2019s not by chance. Perhaps for fear of commitment, or a shortened attention span in the age of social media, I tend to avoid reading long books. Often, when looking for my next read in bookshops, my eyes avoid the bulky tomes \u2013 and I (shamefully) look at the page count before reading the blurb. I\u2019d like to remedy this in 2024. I\u2019m craving the immersive experience that a long read often provides, with a meticulous sense of place and time, and sweeping character arc. More than this, there is a discipline that comes with reading longer works: you must be more consistent, reading a little each day instead of 300 pages one day and zero for two weeks. I\u2019d like to apply that discipline to other aspects of my life, particularly my writing, which, like my reading, tends to come in fits and starts. I\u2019ll probably start with Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver, which I\u2019ve heard only good things about. I also have in mind Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, which I\u2019ve been meaning to read for years, In Ascension by Martin MacInnes, and The Love Songs of WEB Du Bois by Honor\u00e9e Fanonne Jeffers. On the nonfiction side, I\u2019m currently reading American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, and would like to read Eve by Cat Bohannon. Wandering Souls by Cecile Pin is out in paperback, published by 4th Estate \u2018I\u2019m drawn to nonfiction about climate change and motherhood\u2019 Alice Winn Lately, I\u2019ve been finding myself drawn to nonfiction, possibly because, with novels, I\u2019ve seen how the sausage is made, so nonfiction feels like an escape. I have a theory that I am more psychologically equipped to think about climate change when it\u2019s cold outside, so am aiming to read The Climate Book edited by Greta Thunberg early in the year. It\u2019s a collection of essays by more than 100 experts, so I figure if one essay depresses me, the next might have a more cheerful outlook. Aubrey Gordon is a co-host on the podcast Maintenance Phase, about anti-fat bias and the food system generally. I love the podcast because she and Michael Hobbes are funny and personable, but I also really feel they have improved my media literacy. So I\u2019m looking forward to reading Gordon\u2019s new book, You Just Need to Lose Weight: And 19 Other Myths About Fat People, which I assume will be charming and informative. Liana Finck is my favourite New Yorker cartoonist, and she had a baby not long before I did. Her cartoons cheered me up, especially because I found them on Instagram, buried among sponsored posts about how my child would grow up to be a serial killer if she didn\u2019t get enough tummy time. Her new book How to Baby: A No-Advice-Given Guide to Motherhood promises to be a mixture of funny essays, lists (\u201cNesting. The Comprehensive List of What to Buy and Why Getting Things Used Is Dangerous and Unamerican\u201d) and observations about motherhood. I want it! While nursing my daughter I got into the crusades and read Steven Runciman\u2019s excellent history in three volumes. Baldwin the Leper King! Saladin! Wily Frankish queens! So I\u2019m really looking forward to reading The Crusades Through Arab Eyes by Amin Maalouf (1984), which draws on primary sources to tell the story from an Arab perspective. \u2022 In Memoriam by Alice Winn is published by Viking", "date": "2024-01-06", "section": "Books", "author": "Sathnam Sanghera, Sarah Waters, Elif Shafak, Benjamin Myers, Sheena Patel, Sebastian Barry, Cecile Pin and Alice Winn", "id": 500, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/60bcbd155493fad16a31c2e9a28493f56b018e18/503_11_5684_3411/500.jpg"}, {"title": "How to turn fruit peelings into a herbal tea \u2013 recipe | Waste not", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/06/how-to-turn-fruit-peelings-into-herbal-tea-recipe-zero-waste-cooking-tom-hunt", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.022, "neu": 0.746, "pos": 0.232, "compound": 0.9949}, "body": "I like to make my own tea out of foraged, preserved or saved ingredients from the garden, spice rack and fruit bowl, be that dandelion, goosegrass and rosemary from outside, fruit skins and peelings, and spices such as cinnamon, cardamom and ginger.

Once dried, they can be stored in a jar for up to a year. Leftover fruit skin herbal tea Herbal teas are costly to buy in teabag form, but they are incredibly simple to make from loose tea and ingredients from your garden, larder and fruit bowl. Fruit peelings are full of essential oils and aromatics, so are perfect for making your own tea; the quality and intensity of flavour will also be far superior. Try creating your own flavour combinations inspired by commercial herbal teas: turmeric gold, for example, can be made by mixing turmeric skins with green tea, while I make my own \u201clove\u201d tea with chamomile, lime peelings and dried or fresh edible flowers (marigold, lavender or rose, say). To make relaxing tea, mix fennel seeds with chamomile, orange peel, lemon balm and cardamom seeds. I\u2019m quite happy to have all the different ingredients floating around in the cup, but strain the tea first, if you prefer. Per serve 3-6 fruit peelings, dried or fresh (apple, orange, pomegranate), preferably organic \u00bc tsp dried herbs, or 1 sprig fresh (rosemary, sage, thyme; optional) 1 pinch spice (cinnamon, clove, vanilla), optional, to taste Depending on how strong you want the tea, and how many you\u2019re serving, put the fruit peelings in a mug, cafetiere or saucepan and cover with a cupful of boiling water per person. A quick steep in a cup or cafetiere will yield a mild flavour and might need the addition of more flavours, whereas a quick boil in a saucepan will create a stronger, more intense drink. If you like, add the dried or fresh herbs, and follow with an optional pinch of spice to taste. Leave to steep in a cup of cafetiere for five minutes, or bring up to a simmer in a saucepan, cook for three minutes, then turn off the heat and steep for five minutes.

Inside it live five female refugees from Eritrea. The neat, terrace property, they say, has provided them with a lifeline. Two of the women, Mariam and Helen (not their real names) said before arriving here they had spent short periods homeless and on the streets after the Home Office granted them refugee status. \u201cI don\u2019t have words to describe how I feel to be able to live in this house,\u201d said Mariam. \u201cI know a lot of people suffering with homelessness and it is particularly difficult and dangerous for women to have to sleep on the streets. This house is the best place. It is quiet and secure and nobody can disturb us here.\u201d Their home is spotlessly clean and freshly decorated with a spacious communal lounge and a large kitchen with smart grey units and ample cooking and storage facilities. There is a decent-sized back garden with a table and chairs where the women will be able to enjoy the outdoors when the weather improves. They have a cleaning rota to ensure everyone does their share to keep the house pristine. It is one of 19 properties managed by the charity Boaz Trust, a member of one of the Guardian and Observer 2023 charity appeal partners Naccom. The lion\u2019s share of Naccom\u2019s share of appeal donations will be regranted to member organisations working on the frontline of refugee homelessness. Boaz provides accommodation to a mix of refugees and refused asylum seekers who have no recourse to public funds. Rents in line with the local housing allowance are charged to refugees who have the right to work and access benefits and these payments subsidise the places for people. The trust provides wraparound support to those it accommodates to help them get on their feet as quickly as possible. This includes everything from employment and benefits advice, registering with a GP and obtaining a travel document to finding a new immigration lawyer to prepare a fresh asylum claim for those whose claims have been refused. The house the Eritrean women share is a stark contrast from both the type of accommodation often provided to asylum seekers by the Home Office. Unlike Home Office-procured accommodation, which uses a network of private companies, Boaz is not about making big profits. Shared housing provided by Home Office contractors is in many cases of poor quality. Horror stories about damp, mould, collapsed ceilings and infestations of vermin are not uncommon. Use of hotels, along with mass accommodation sites such as Wethersfield airfield in Essex and the Bibby Stockholm barge moored in Portland, Dorset, has attracted criticism from asylum seekers and human rights campaigners and has been the subject of various legal challenges. Sara Nathan, the co-founder of Refugees At Home, another of the charity appeal\u2019s 2023 partners, said the problems with Home Office provision of accommodation for asylum seekers were fixable: \u201cIf the Home Office made decisions quicker, there would be so much less demand for asylum seekers to be housed at all, let alone expensively in hotels. She urged the Home Office to provide homes that are \u201cdignified and appropriate\u201d. She said: \u201cIf asylum seekers could work and pay their own way, some would not need accommodation, and for others the transition into refugee life when they get leave to remain would be smoother and more productive.\u201d Jon Featonby, the chief policy analyst at the Refugee Council, a third Guardian and Observer appeal partner, said: \u201cPoor accommodation is a significant problem for those in the asylum system. What we have seen is a government that is all too willing to create more hardship for refugees, stripping away housing protections and introducing policies that negatively impact their health and wellbeing. It\u2019s shameful to see people seeking safety treated this way in a country that has long upheld values of fairness and compassion.\u201d Ros Holland, the chief executive of the Boaz Trust, said there was no single solution to fixing the problems with asylum seeker and refugee housing, and that a range of options were needed. But with a combination of decent housing and wraparound support, which is bespoke for each individual, rapid progress can be made. \u201cWe see people transformed when they have a place to stay and a space to recover in,\u201d she said. Mariam moved into the Manchester house in August. Her English has improved and she has a driving test booked in the hope that it will allow her to get a job as a care worker looking after people in their own homes. \u201cNow that I\u2019m a refugee and I have somewhere to live I want to help other people.

He had the worst anxiety in the world of anyone I\u2019ve ever met and was extremely risk-averse. I remember getting really excited about it snowing outside and my dad sat me on the bed and told me the story of a boy at his school who was blinded by a snowball. I was traumatised by that, and other endless horror stories. My dad also had a massive ego. He was in this mod band called Relay. Instead of reading us bedtime stories he\u2019d bring his guitar in and talk about the band. He once told us he wrote the song Tambourine Man. For years, whenever I heard it on the radio, I\u2019d think: my fucking dad wrote this. I eventually challenged him on it. He said, \u201cI never said I wrote that,\u201d but he fucking well did. Our upbringing was unconventional, but we just thought it was the norm. I once shared a mattress with my brother, Charlie. We\u2019d been evicted from the home my parents were renting. They\u2019d not paid their rent for five months; we ended up in a tiny two-bedroom council house, where my parents still live. We were actually in our 20s at the time. What happened if one of us pulled? That never happened. My experience of Rada was traumatic. The tutors practised the Stanislavski Method. Us students were made to talk about our experiences of rape and miscarriage in order to be as \u201creal\u201d as possible. It was bollocks. Acting is just pretending. You can either do it or you can\u2019t. This Country changed everything. My whole sense of self-worth shifted. I was validated. People were like, \u201cYeah, yeah, they\u2019re going to write something, of course they are.\u201d But we did. We had zero money before. I couldn\u2019t even afford tampons. Now I don\u2019t have to think about money. It\u2019s brilliant not to be on the hamster wheel of worry. How do I chill out? I masturbate. I love reading books. I really love ghost stories and walking around haunted places. I\u2019ve seen a ghost \u2013 it was underwhelming. Meeting Rami Malek at Jimmy Carr\u2019s party blew my mind. His girlfriend was a big This Country fan. Did he offer me a part in his next film? Did he fuck. I feel pressure to maintain success, but I\u2019m not as ambitious as I used to be. If this is my lot, I\u2019m happy with it. As long as I can keep doing my Cameo videos, that\u2019ll do me. Being famous is fucking brilliant. I can just ring up Pizza Express and get a table there on a busy Saturday. The next thing I want to do is write a film. That\u2019s what Simon Pegg did. I remember him saying, \u201cMoney wise, don\u2019t bother with TV series, the money is in movies.\u201d So I\u2019m going to give that a go. If that fails, I\u2019m going to start my own OnlyFans account; whatever is the least amount of effort. I\u2019d charge punters \u00a3100 for me to say, \u201cYou\u2019re a cockwomble\u201d to them. My ultimate ambition is to write the film script for Katie Price: The Movie.

She won\u2019t be told how to get into character. She won\u2019t tolerate what she calls \u201cvoodoo\u201d directing, that is am-dram, shake-your-body-out nonsense. She won\u2019t respond to certain types of \u201calpha\u201d interference from people up the industry chain. (The only time Foster submits to bossy producers, she says, is when they are \u201csuper passive-aggressive British people\u201d \u2013 a type she just can\u2019t resist.) In work mode, and outside interactions with the press, she is conscientious, matter-of-fact, with almost no performance anxiety or self-consciousness. \u201cI approach a story or character in the same way I do a book report,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to make it pragmatic.\u201d We are in a hotel suite in West Hollywood where the 61-year-old is charming and pleasant, with gel-spiked hair, tiny-waisted black trousers and a crisp white shirt popped at the collar. She could be a matador, or someone in high-end catering, and the sheer familiarity of her face and manner is startling. The voice and smile, the teasing laugh and intensity, evoke decades of iconic roles, from Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs and Sarah Tobias in The Accused, back to her childhood roles in Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone. Foster kicks off her mules to reveal red painted toenails, and tucks her legs up under her, an unstudied gesture \u2013 or a knowing one. After five decades of fame, I imagine she understands as well as I do that, \u201cshe tucks her legs up under her\u201d is the type of dumb line profile writers like to use to summon fake intimacy. There is another side to Foster; one that is markedly less straightforward and, over the years, has made much of the coverage of her painful to read. She can be intensely self-conscious, a state if not wholly created then certainly intensified by the experience of having journalists test every conceivable angle to get the subject of her sexuality on the table. For a long time, Foster was the only visible gay woman in Hollywood and these days her ability to talk publicly about her life is mired in something that, to me, looks a lot like PTSD. Anyway, here we are, ostensibly to talk about True Detective: Night Country, the fourth season of the bro-y cult anthology show previously stewarded by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and that, this season, finally features some women. Foster plays Liz Danvers, chief of police of Ennis, a godforsaken small town in the far north of Alaska, where we join the story on the eve of permanent night: the two months of the year when that part of the world is in darkness. It\u2019s a police procedural, an odd-couple buddy drama, an affecting depiction of North American Indigenous life and, like the other True Detectives, a tale of the supernatural that doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense but still offers a highly enjoyable ride. Foster\u2019s cop, \u201cAlaska Karen\u201d as she puts it, is lonely and embittered, spitting out lines like: \u201cStop where you are, Ennis police \u2026 fucker.\u201d As roles go it\u2019s not a big stretch for Foster, who enjoyed shooting the six-parter in Iceland, but there is a satisfying arc for her character that is clearly her kind of thing. A more arresting feature of the show is considering what it must have been like for the relatively young cast and crew to work alongside Jodie Foster. Apart from Fiona Shaw, who plays a former university professor living on the edge of town and with whom Foster had no scenes (they dined together, she says), the production is made up of mostly new and inexperienced performers. Kali Reis, who is brilliant as Evangeline Navarro, Danvers\u2019 Indigenous sidekick, was until recently a professional boxer; Issa L\u00f3pez, the director, is a successful Mexican writer who has made a handful of Spanish-language movies, including the fantasy-horror film Tigers Are Not Afraid, but this is her first big project in the US. Foster, by contrast, has been in about 50 productions, directed multiple films and TV episodes, won two best actress Oscars, for The Silence of the Lambs and The Accused. Some singular quality in Foster that is hard to describe \u2013 a kind of flinching intensity, perhaps \u2013 along with the sheer volume and standard of her work, puts her close to being an icon. What on earth can it have been like for the young people working with her? She won\u2019t have this, of course. \u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty fun. I mean \u2013 I don\u2019t take anything seriously. I make jokes all the time.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnd, you know, I\u2019m not an expert.\u201d This makes me laugh out loud. You are the definition of an expert. You\u2019ve been doing this job since you were three years old! Imagine De Niro or Pacino saying such a thing. Foster smiles. \u201cNot really. I just know me, I don\u2019t really know anybody else, and even as a director \u2013 I\u2019m not really an actor\u2019s director, interestingly.\u201d Foster\u2019s directorial debut, the 1991 movie Little Man Tate, in which she also starred, has been followed in her directing career by a handful of movies and individual episodes of TV shows such as Orange Is the New Black and Black Mirror. \u201cI really let the actors do their thing and just hope I\u2019ve cast correctly. I\u2019m not somebody who can tease a performance on take 200. I believe that you cast, and allow something to happen on screen, and, if you do it fast enough, people don\u2019t overthink themselves.\u201d She has very particular requirements when it comes to being directed herself, and if there was any difficulty on True Detective \u2013 \u201cWell, not difficult, but the little dance that has to be done\u201d \u2013 it was with the director, L\u00f3pez. \u201cShe has directed four movies, and I\u2019ve been in so many films, and I think that part is sometimes daunting. But we bonded immediately and laughed through everything. I like it when directors tell me what they want and say things like faster, slower. I\u2019m not interested in directors who are like\u201d \u2013 she puts on a whispery, luvvie-ish voice \u2013 \u201c\u2018Here, let me shake you!\u2019 She might have to do that with other people, because they\u2019re young or they\u2019ve never acted before. And I would watch her do that with them and \u2026 \u201d Foster snorts. \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that with me.\u201d This is the second consecutive project in which Foster has worked with much less experienced directors. On the recent Netflix movie Nyad, in which Foster plays Bonnie Stoll, the best friend and coach of marathon swimmer, Diana Nyad, she was working with an even less seasoned team: first-time feature directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, who had previously only worked in documentary film. I loved Nyad, partly because it was so funny and well written, partly because Annette Bening is brilliant in the title role, and partly because of Foster, who is more relaxed on screen than anything I\u2019ve seen her in since she made Freaky Friday at the age of 13. It is nice, for once, to see her playing someone who isn\u2019t slogging through a trauma or being launched alone into space. In Nyad, she is loose-limbed, and full of easy humour and jokes \u2013 her performance has just been nominated for a Golden Globe. As far as I\u2019m aware, it\u2019s the first time Foster has played an out lesbian. (There\u2019s a separate essay to be written about gay subtext in her depiction of Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs, which lesbians will give you chapter and verse on \u2013 the boots, the duffel coat, the way she shrinks and smirks in relation to the male characters, I could go on). The press around the film, particularly when hacks brought up the fact both lead characters were gay, was customarily awkward. It is worth pointing out here that it is harder for gay women than gay men in Hollywood, where there is no female equivalent of, say, showrunner Ryan Murphy (well, there is; but she\u2019s so far back in the closet she\u2019s practically in Narnia). I don\u2019t blame Foster for withdrawing. Questions about her life aren\u2019t overtly hostile or mocking these days, but there is often still a judgment behind them: from straight people, broadly, why are you still so bent out of shape by this; and from the gay press, why didn\u2019t you do more back in the day? I tell Foster I loved Nyad and she says, brightly: \u201cOh, thanks! I love those two [Bonnie and Diana], so that was the number one reason to do it. I knew them from barbecues and stuff.\u201d There is a trauma narrative in Nyad that is subtly handled. As a teen swim champion, Nyad was molested by her coach. \u201cObviously, they\u2019re young film-makers and there was a lot of \u2013 we all brought our thoughts to the table, having made movies about victims of sexual violence. They shot a lot more than they put in.\u201d Instead, the film focuses on Nyad\u2019s record-breaking swim from Cuba to Florida, undertaken at the age of 64 and in the face of immense physical risks. \u201cThe important thing to Diana and me and Annette was: we cannot think that she achieves the swim because of the molestation. My happiest moment in the film is when Bonnie says as an aside, \u2018Oh, I read in the paper that he [the coach] died.\u2019 And Diana says, \u2018He didn\u2019t mark me; it\u2019s just that sometimes, every once in a while, I feel like I\u2019m 14 again and fighting this stuff.\u2019\u201d Personally, I liked the hangout scenes at the start of the movie, when Foster and Bening are chilling at home in LA, playing table tennis and Scrabble. \u201cYeah. I love those scenes.\u201d To achieve Bonnie\u2019s washboard stomach, Foster worked out like an athlete for six months; she swans about the movie in cutoff shorts and a vest, brandishing her clipboard and whistle like the world\u2019s buffest PE teacher. She has always been portrayed as a nerd, but in light of the evidence isn\u2019t she really just as much of a jock? Foster laughs loudly. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to be objectified my entire life, so I\u2019m very happy that people have started talking about my body parts.\u201d Foster spoke recently about her 50s being a tricky decade of transition in which she had to figure out, in the absence of many role models, how to be a woman above a certain age in Hollywood. She found an answer in friendships both up and down the age range. \u201cI have a friend who I adore, who\u2019s 80. She\u2019s a college professor, she lived in a commune in the early 70s, she\u2019s an extraordinary person. I get to see what\u2019s ahead, what\u2019s possible. For all of her accomplishments, what she keeps saying, which I think is really true, is that the greatest thing is helping communities of other women.\u201d What does she think young people in her industry need to hear? \u201cThey need to learn how to relax, how to not think about it so much, how to come up with something that\u2019s theirs. I can help them find that, which is so much more fun than being, with all the pressure behind it, the protagonist of the story.\u201d I mention to Foster that I saw a photo of her recently with the young British actor, Bella Ramsey, the non-binary star of the HBO zombie hit The Last of Us and who, at 20 years old, is on the brink of megastardom. Last month, Ramsey introduced Foster at the Elle magazine Women in Hollywood celebration, a pairing Foster says she requested herself. \u201cI reached out to Bella, because we\u2019d never met, and said, \u2018I want you to introduce me at this thing\u2019, which is a wonderful event about actors and people in the movies, but is also very much a fashion thing. Which means it\u2019s determining who represents us. [The organisers] are very proud of themselves because they\u2019ve got every ethnicity, and I\u2019m like, yeah, but all the attendees are still wearing heels and eyelashes. There are other ways of being a woman, and it\u2019s really important for people to see that. And Bella, who gave the best speech, was wearing the most perfect suit, beautifully tailored, and a middle parting and no makeup.\u201d As a mentoring relationship, it\u2019s part of a pattern, says Foster. \u201cI do a lot of reaching out to young actresses. I\u2019m compelled. Because it was hard growing up.\u201d When she looks at Ramsey, who told British Vogue earlier this year that \u201cI\u2019m not 100% straight\u201d, does she feel a pang of sympathy for her younger self? \u201cYes.\u201d It was so bleak. \u201cBut I had my mom, you know.\u201d Foster\u2019s late mother, Brandy, was a force of nature in the entertainment industry, who raised her four children in LA and stewarded Foster, from the age of three, when she first put her up for commercials, to stardom. Could she have worn a suit and had a severe middle parting with no makeup when she was coming up as a young actor? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause we weren\u2019t free. Because we didn\u2019t have freedom. And hopefully that\u2019s what the vector of authenticity that\u2019s happening offers \u2013 the possibility of real freedom. We had other things that were good. And I would say: I did the best I could for my generation. I was very busy understanding where I fitted in and where I wanted to be in terms of feminism. But my lens wasn\u2019t wide enough. I lived in an incredibly segregated world.\u201d I mention something she said the other day about fear dictating most of our choices. \u201cIt can. It keeps you safe.\u201d But it\u2019s also warping, isn\u2019t it? Beyond a certain point? \u201cWell, it\u2019s a survival skill. But one that will kill you eventually.\u201d I should add that, for all her cheerleading of gen Z, Foster isn\u2019t above being irritated by them. \u201cThey\u2019re really annoying, especially in the workplace. They\u2019re like, \u2018Nah, I\u2019m not feeling it today, I\u2019m gonna come in at 10.30am.\u2019 Or, like, in emails, I\u2019ll tell them this is all grammatically incorrect, did you not check your spelling? And they\u2019re like, \u2018Why would I do that, isn\u2019t that kind of limiting?\u2019\u201d Foster has two sons, Kit and Charles, who are in their 20s and whom she had with her ex-partner, film producer Cydney Bernard. She and Bernard split up in 2008 and for the last 10 years she has been married to the photographer Alexandra Hedison. A funny effect of her sons\u2019 upbringing, says Foster, was their early confusion over how, precisely, to be male. \u201cMy two don\u2019t like sports,\u201d she says. \u201cThey like to watch movies and sit at home, and they\u2019re really into their female friends. They\u2019re super feminist. And there was a moment with my older one when he was in high school, when, because he was raised by two women \u2013 three women \u2013 it was like he was trying to figure out what it was to be a boy. And he watched television and came to the conclusion, oh, I just need to be an asshole. I understand! I need to be shitty to women, and act like I\u2019m a fucker. And I was like, no! That\u2019s not what it is to be a man! That\u2019s what our culture has been selling you for all this time.\u201d The phase went on for six months, she says. Did she let it play out? \u201cYes, and no. I was like, you won\u2019t be talking to me like that.\u201d Foster bursts into laughter. Meanwhile, her wife has just had a short documentary called Alok \u2013 a portrait of the non-binary author, poet and comedian Alok Vaid-Menon \u2013 accepted by Sundance, which Foster says makes her very proud. Although Foster served as the short film\u2019s executive producer, they are not overly involved in each other\u2019s work. \u201cWe like doing our work independently, although there are things that I do better, she recognises.\u201d Sounds ominous. Like what? \u201cI\u2019m a really good letter writer. And she\u2019s extraordinarily visual. Great photographer.\u201d Getting to this place of seeming security and happiness with Hedison has been a struggle for Foster. Even minor celebrity is corrosive, and Foster\u2019s fame is ridiculous. It has taken years of work, she says, not to be ruined by it. \u201cThere is a meta-weirdness to having been a public figure from the time you were young, right? Especially if you have stayed being an actor.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until she took time off mid-career that she realised just how odd her life was. Suddenly, \u201cI had lots of time where I wasn\u2019t the most important person in the room. Or not everybody was listening to the stupid shit I was ranting about. Being a public figure, your universe is altered and you just don\u2019t know anything else. And you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re a blowhard, and that you\u2019re not a good friend, and that you never show up.\u201d Because people indulge you? \u201cBecause people indulge you. So there are hard lessons you have to learn. There\u2019s something Hugh Grant said, which I thought was right on: that the fame thing at a young age is like being shot up with steroids and you live with those big muscles your whole life, and then, one day, you make the decision that there are no more steroids. And you don\u2019t recognise yourself and have no idea who you are. And you have to rebuild an entire identity. That can be difficult, and that\u2019s something I had to learn late.\u201d During the years Foster was with Bernard, she never took her to the Oscars or other public events, and never publicly owned to their relationship \u2013 although she did, later, pay tribute to her in her 2013 Golden Globes speech, when after thanking Bernard she said, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of our modern family.\u201d What\u2019s the reckoning, I ask. Is it someone telling you they can\u2019t live with you any more because you\u2019re so awful? \u201cYes. Definitely. An actor\u2019s life is not a good life to be self-aware. It\u2019s very easy to be un-self-aware.\u201d Presumably the magnetic pull back towards being an arsehole is strong, although, says Foster, she has strategies in place. \u201cI think, healthily, I created compartments around things. But the compartments are problematic for my relationships.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to know me in this context.\u201d She indicates the surroundings of the interview. \u201cThis is just mine. My friends don\u2019t know it, my kids didn\u2019t know what I did for a living till quite late. They had no idea. I never brought them on set.\u201d That\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it? \u201cI guess it\u2019s good? But then there\u2019s other actors whose kids are like, \u2018Oh, I lived in Romania [when my parent was filming] and I did this and that \u2026 \u2019 and I didn\u2019t do any of that with my kids. Maybe they would\u2019ve had adventures, or something.\u201d The point is, she says, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing normal about being a public figure from the time when you were young, and there\u2019s a lot of negotiating around that \u2013 to figure out how to be a whole person\u201d. It can\u2019t have been easy for her and yet she still gets a lot of stick for decisions she has made over the years. \u201cAnd I will never be able to explain,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause unless you were there, you don\u2019t get it. There are choices that I made that people can say, \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 Well, you didn\u2019t walk in my shoes. Try to walk in my shoes and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d * * * I have one quick question about The Silence of the Lambs. One thing about Foster\u2019s acting is that, because of the intelligence she brings to her roles, she very rarely caves in to cliche. When she won the best actress Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992, it was for a role that felt like nothing we had seen on screen before. The chemistry between Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Foster as the trainee FBI agent made the movie, but, of the two of them, it was Foster\u2019s film. There\u2019s a scene at the end where Clarice is groping her way through the killer\u2019s house in the pitch dark, and he\u2019s watching her through night-vision goggles. And her hand, holding the gun out in front of her, is shaking with nerves. It runs against every boilerplate depiction of the hard-charging FBI agent. She is quivering with fear, and my question is: was that detail Foster\u2019s or director Jonathan Demme\u2019s idea? \u201cIt was my idea.\u201d Knew it! \u201cThat felt right to me. There was something unexpected about Clarice \u2013 that she was able to have power, but was so vulnerable and had that smallness. She recognised that she wasn\u2019t powerful physically, and it didn\u2019t occur to me that there was anything revolutionary about that. You\u2019re playing somebody who could be what we see as a male character \u2013 the action guy. But she\u2019s not; she\u2019s Clarice.\u201d Foster could be describing herself. The contrast between smallness and power is somehow central to her appeal and is also present in her ability to enforce boundaries off-screen. \u201cI\u2019m not a multitasker. I\u2019m a weird focused person. If there\u2019s a spectrum, that\u2019s my spectrum. It doesn\u2019t matter if there are planes going by or if someone is calling my name, if I\u2019m focused on something. I\u2019m really good at going, no thank you, I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d No kidding. She won\u2019t be moved and she won\u2019t be put upon, and, at this point in her life, she won\u2019t be made to feel bad about any of it, either. \u201cYou can get a skin as an actor, not just for being criticised, but [told what to do]: \u2018Can you move your body there? Can you do this, can you be emotional here?\u2019 I learned how to do all that. And I will not.\u201d For decades, Foster was chastised in public for doing it wrong and lectured on how she should be doing it instead. \u201cAnd now,\u201d she says, looking at me rather pointedly, \u201cI\u2019m like, I\u2019ll do it for my job, and I\u2019m not going to do it for you.\u201d \u2022 True Detective: Night Country is available on Sky Atlantic and Now from 15 January.", "date": "2024-01-06", "section": "Film", "author": "Emma Brockes", "id": 505, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f3f2dfd19d9648422c429a7cfe4695a18d4249a2/0_1064_4825_2894/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Notes on chocolate: it\u2019s time to taste the most expensive chocs in the country | Annalisa Barbieri", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/07/notes-on-chocolate-the-most-expensive-in-the-country", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.07, "neu": 0.698, "pos": 0.231, "compound": 0.9785}, "body": "Chantal Coady, the only chocolatier to be made an OBE for services to chocolate, started Rococo 40 years ago.

The Cru Criollo truffles are being launched to celebrate Rococo\u2019s ruby anniversary. Criollo is the rarest of beans, making up just 0.01% of cocoa in the world, and the truffles come in three permutations, from a dark milk at 38% to a 75%. It\u2019s hard to fault them.

Another set of really good truffles were the single-origin ganache ones by Coco Chemistry. I wasn\u2019t expecting much, as I find cream truffles (which these are) very hit and miss. Either the shell is so thick to contain the ganache that you have to practically unhinge your jaw or they just hope that using the word ganache on a label makes up for all manner of ills.

In disgrace following widespread reporting of corruption, racism and even sexual assault within their ranks, the ceremony was boycotted by the industry and dropped by its longtime broadcasting partner NBC. The awards went ahead, unattended and untelevised, posing an equivalent showbiz question to the old \u201cif a tree falls in a forest\u201d conundrum. Turns out they did make something of a sound: cue the awkward social-media spectacle of winners such as Nicole Kidman and Rachel Zegler advertising their victories while sternly admonishing the voters. In the frenetic, dog-eat-dog rush of awards season, even a tarnished win is an opportunity. After all, it\u2019s not as if the globes fell from a very high pedestal. For years, the small-time, even obscure nature of the HFPA membership \u2013 and its often questionable decisions, including an infamous win for Pia Zadora in the 80s amid allegations of bribery, or a best picture nomination for the Johnny Depp calamity The Tourist \u2013 was a point of mockery from industry folk, who were still all too happy to attend their boozy January shindig. In the current climate of social consciousness, however, it became harder to look the other way from less trivial allegations \u2013 including actor Brendan Fraser\u2019s claim that former HFPA president Philip Berk groped him at an industry event. Pundits speculated that it was finally the end of the road for a tacky but once-treasured Hollywood institution. Yet what a difference a painstaking PR makeover makes. After a tentative return to television last year \u2013 still boycotted by some nominees, including Fraser \u2013 the globes this year are splashily declaring themselves not just back but entirely different: new voters, a new attitude, even a couple of new award categories. Hollywood, meanwhile, will be returning in all its most glittery finery, proving that you can\u2019t keep a good back-patting ceremony down. Or even a dubious one. There\u2019s a completely new voter base One thing everyone used to know about the Golden Globes is that they were run by the HFPA. Quite what, or who, that meant was a murkier question. Essentially a nonprofit organisation of entertainment journalists for non-US outlets, it was a small club (about 100 members at its largest, and thus a far easier group to sway than the 10,500-member academy that votes on the Oscars) but not a lofty one. Their seamy reputation was tolerated until 2021, when an LA Times investigation into the HFPA\u2019s ethics and demographic makeup turned up, among other scandals, a complete lack of black members. Now disbanded, the association has been replaced with an invited group of 300 international journalists: 47% female and only 40% white, as boasted by the Globes\u2019 new owners, private equity firm Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions. This year\u2019s mostly respectable nominations \u2013 topped by summer siblings Barbie and Oppenheimer, but heavy on critically adored art films such as Past Lives, Anatomy of a Fall and The Zone of Interest \u2013 suggest the new group would rather not be sneered at. Barbie is the one to beat\u2026 maybe Barbie leads all contenders at this year\u2019s Golden Globe awards with a whopping nine nominations \u2013 tied with the 1972 musical Cabaret for the second-most of all time, with only another 70s classic, Nashville, ahead of them on 11. Cynics might point out that three of Barbie\u2019s nominations are in the relatively minor best original song category, while another comes in the newly created and oddly defined category of cinematic and box office achievement, alongside the less prestigious likes of The Super Mario Bros Movie and Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. (When the Oscars floated a similar-sounding best popular film award a few years ago, it was ultimately scrapped for being craven and confusing \u2013 two adjectives the globes have never feared.) Don\u2019t assume Barbie\u2019s nomination haul guarantees a good night for Team Gerwig, however, particularly with fierce competition from Poor Things in the comedy/musical categories: from its record-breaking 11 bids, Nashville won a single award\u2026 for best original song. Don\u2019t place your Oscar bets just yet Then again, for those with an eye on the biggest prize \u2013 the Oscar \u2013 the globes aren\u2019t the be-all and end-all. For years, it was assumed that the globes were a reliable Oscar predictor but recently they\u2019ve diverged significantly, as pundits look more to industry guild awards and the Baftas for Oscar tea leaves. In the last 20 years, only eight best picture Oscar winners won the corresponding prize at the globes. Last year, globe voters preferred Martin McDonagh\u2019s The Banshees of Inisherin to eventual Oscar sweeper Everything Everywhere All at Once, just as they did Austin Butler and Angela Bassett to Oscar winners Brendan Fraser and Jamie Lee Curtis. The year before, Jane Campion\u2019s queer western The Power of the Dog trumped cheesy Oscar champ Coda; in others, they opted for The Social Network over The King\u2019s Speech, The Grand Budapest Hotel over Birdman, Brokeback Mountain over shock Oscar victor Crash, and so on. They can be hipper than you think If, like many critics and cinephiles, you think those choices reflect rather well on the beleaguered, less prestigious ceremony, here\u2019s the thing nobody tends to admit about the globes: they sometimes have better, bolder taste than you might think. This is the group, after all, that nominated David Lynch\u2019s visionary Mulholland Drive for best picture in 2001 \u2013 something the Oscars cannot claim \u2013 and has recently handed out inspired acting wins to the likes of Isabelle Huppert, for her daringly perverse portrayal of a conflicted rape victim in Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Elle, and Sally Hawkins, who wasn\u2019t even Oscar- or Bafta-nominated, for her highly original comic turn in Mike Leigh\u2019s Happy-Go-Lucky. Indeed, the globes\u2019 comedy/musical category has enabled them to reward various classic films and performances for which the Academy was too po-faced: Marilyn Monroe may never have received an Oscar nomination, but she did pick up a well-deserved Globe for Some Like It Hot. They have a serious thing for Barbra Streisand For all their past diversity-related controversies, the globes beat the Oscars to one particular milestone by 26 years. Whereas it took the latter until 2010 to reward a woman for best director \u2013 Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker \u2013 the globes did it all the way back in 1984. Admittedly, the HFPA didn\u2019t have to move outside their celebrity-loving comfort zone to do this: the winner was Barbra Streisand for her directorial debut, the self-aggrandising musical Yentl, an achievement the academy\u2019s directors\u2019 branch chose not to nominate at all. As it happens, between her achievements in acting, filmmaking and songwriting, La Streisand holds the record for the most Golden Globe trophies with 10. (Meryl Streep, with eight, holds the record for acting wins alone.) With globe voters having preferred James Cameron to Bigelow in the year of her Oscar coronation, only Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and Jane Campion have since joined Streisand on the list of women to win for directing: Greta Gerwig and Past Lives newcomer Celine Song are hoping to join them this year. They didn\u2019t have a host until 2010 Traditionally, the appeal of the globes has been that it\u2019s the more fun, more raucous version of the Oscars. With seating around dinner tables rather than theatre-style, and alcohol flowing freely throughout, it has a reputation for entertainingly inebriated speeches and chaotic mishaps \u2013 the night where a hammered Elizabeth Taylor couldn\u2019t open the envelope for the award she was presenting, and when Ren\u00e9e Zellweger was in the loo when her best actress win was announced. A frill-free ceremony \u2013 just awards, no production numbers, no emcee \u2013 was a key part of their informality. Then, in 2010, they introduced a tradition of suitably fast-and-loose hosts, including Ricky Gervais and the popular duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. This year, the job falls to a lesser-known comic, Filipino-American standup Jo Koy. It\u2019s a big gig, though still comes with nothing like the pressure of hosting the Oscars. Oh, and they\u2019re not just about film Where the Oscars\u2019 viewership figures have declined in parallel with diminishing cinemagoing numbers, the globes have their additional television awards to lure in small screen-inclined audiences. Though the Emmys retain their reputation as the most prestigious prize in TV, the Golden Globes \u2013 drawn to shiny new things, and thus less inclined than the Emmys to pick the same winners year on year \u2013 can be more exciting on this front. It\u2019s the group that handed best series prizes to the Emmy-less likes of Brideshead Revisited, Twin Peaks, Girls and the original British version of The Office. This year, viewers can see if that trend results in wins for hot new series like The Last of Us and Jury Duty, or if past victors Succession and Abbott Elementary prevail again. Meanwhile, a brand new category for best performance in standup comedy on television \u2013 with the nominees including Ricky Gervais, Amy Schumer and Chris Rock \u2013 gives the Golden Globes a unique selling point in a crowded season of awards shows: no other major ceremony has an equivalent.", "date": "2024-01-07", "section": "Film", "author": "Guy Lodge", "id": 507, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7cfceea62e49264daa64222728cfd502dd461947/0_94_3300_1981/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Change the lights!

Everything seems harder, gravity\u2019s pull feels heavier and bed becomes a lethargy-breeding haven. Then along comes the new year and with it the annual push to be reborn as improved humans, as though it were spring. Which it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s dark and cold and we are still recovering from a festive season of too many \u201cshoulds\u201d \u2013 should have fun, should party, should have the friends and family over for a super-feast. It is a time when even more than normal is expected of us, says psychologist Dr Linda Blair. Paying heed to all the shoulds goes some way to explaining why many of us feel low on batteries. While the thought of detoxes, boot camps and resolutions might be as appealing as a turkey smoothie, now is the time to focus instead on how to \u201csay no gracefully, without hurting feelings, when you know you\u2019re at your limit of what you can do\u201d, says Blair. Executive coach and author Viv Chitty prefers to talk about \u201cdepleted energy\u201d rather than low energy, because, she says, \u201clow energy may not necessarily be a negative state to be in\u201d. You could simply be calm, contemplative or deeply listening. Even a feeling of low energy outside those realms is not bad per se. \u201cIt means you want to rest and recuperate,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you listen to what your body and mind are telling you, you can learn what you really need.\u201d You\u2019ll know if you have problematic depleted energy, Chitty says, \u201cwhen you feel unable to focus on work, or to be interested in what\u2019s going on around you. It will affect work performance and relationships, and needs to be addressed.\u201d Here is some expert knowhow on escaping that blanket exhaustion, along with our writers\u2019 top tips for getting fired up and ready to go. Resist lie-ins Don\u2019t be tempted to go into \u201cgoblin mode\u201d just because it\u2019s cold and dark. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to feel jet-lagged,\u201d says Dr Renata Riha of the University of Edinburgh\u2019s sleep medicine department, \u201cespecially in winter when the days are short, if you sleep in too much.\u201d Instead, get up and be ready to head out once the sun has finally emerged. \u201cTake a brisk walk or even a meander in the fresh air during the hours of light, particularly early on,\u201d adds Riha, who also recommends not keeping your house too stuffy: \u201cBed socks for cold feet rather than turning the thermostat on.\u201d Stroke animals and dance \u201cWhen you touch another mammal, both of you release oxytocin,\u201d says psychologist Dr Linda Blair. It\u2019s often called the love hormone, but actually, she says, \u201cit\u2019s the safety hormone and the basis of starting to feel better is to first feel safe.\u201d Then dance. \u201cMoving to rhythm is a primitive way to communicate joy,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we\u2019re feeling tired and emotional, memories tend to clump by emotion, so bad thoughts like, \u2018I don\u2019t have any energy,\u2019 call up other bad thoughts, which make you feel worse.\u201d But if you dance to music that you associate with happy times the opposite will happen. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better, you\u2019ll feel great.\u201d Identify what fills your tank Sit down and have a think about what gives you energy and what takes it away, says executive coach and author Viv Chitty. This can include physical influences, such as nutrition, hydration, sedentary behaviour, sleep, rest, your age and the impact of hormones. But it also includes our emotions and thought processes, work, parenting and caring for elderly relatives. \u201cIdentify what fills your tank and what empties it,\u201d she Chitty. \u201cYou could have a simple diagram on your wall.\u201d Then you can figure out the steps you can take to manage the energy drains and maximise the boosters. Eat breakfast If you want more energy and focus, eat breakfast. \u201cI cannot stress enough the importance of eating breakfast,\u201d says Gavin Sandercock, professor at the University of Essex\u2019s School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences. \u201cBreakfast being defined as proper food that requires cutlery, preferably greater than 300 calories, eaten sitting down.\u201d Visualise your energy \u201cElectricity flows through our bodies, igniting everything from the neurons in our brain to cardiac cells that pump our blood,\u201d says Tracy Anderson, fitness pioneer and creator of the Tracy Anderson Method, who famously honed Madonna\u2019s athletic physique. \u201cSo when we talk about getting our energy back in the new year, it\u2019s important to remember we never lost it. Alternative ways of thinking about energy can help so, as well as working conventional muscle groups, Anderson likes to focus on her \u201cheart centre\u201d \u2013 a phrase more usually associated with yoga. She uses exercises that challenge the mind and body together. A good example is: stand with your eyes open, arms fully extended to the sides, palms facing up and fingers straight. Imagine holding something precious and vulnerable in your hands. Rotate your hands towards the ground, then towards the back wall and, finally, up towards the ceiling, while simultaneously bending into a squat with a flat back. Reverse the hand rotation as you stand up, being careful not to \u201cdrop\u201d the imaginary object. Not only will this improve physical health, she says, \u201cbut it emphasises the importance of cognitive awareness in overall wellbeing and brings a deeper understanding of the energy within your body.\u201d Socialise without stressing Author and illustrator Sophie Lucido Johnson\u2019s newsletter, You are Doing a Good Enough Job is packed with joyful ways to recharge and resist productivity culture. \u201cThe festive season teaches us that socialisation is stressful, so people tend to isolate in January,\u201d she says. \u201cFind opportunities to gather in ways that don\u2019t feel challenging, with people who don\u2019t stress you out. Instead of fraught dinners with meticulously planned menus, get together with friends and don\u2019t bother cleaning. Have a singalong or order pizza or have a gathering where everyone just drinks tea and reads books in each other\u2019s company.\u201d Do the twist Make time for a \u201ccalming and energising\u201d easy, seated twist, says yoga teacher Zoe Speekenbrink. Sit cross-legged or on your heels, rooting your weight in your sitting bones and lengthening your spine. Breathe in and, as you breathe out, twist to your right, taking your right hand to the floor behind you. Bring your left hand to the outside of your right knee. Take another breath and exhale as you move deeper into the twist, from the torso. Inhale as you come back to centre, then do the same on the other side. Light up your life Light impacts mood and increases vitality, says Linda Geddes, author of Chasing the Sun, an exploration of how light affects our health and wellbeing. Studies also show light exposure improves alertness and helps us sleep \u2013 so get outside or, failing that, give yourself a boost of light therapy with a Sad lamp. Pump up the volume Listen to the most obnoxious song you can as loudly as you can get away with. Play All I Do Is Win by DJ Khaled to your children on the way to school \u2013 it\u2019ll be like they\u2019ve been electrocharged. Is the energy constructive or destructive? Who knows? But we do know loud music releases dopamine and adrenaline \u2013 and it\u2019s a lot of fun. Start a Nap Club A nap is both illicit and wholesome; a sweet spot. Make it an event. Get your nicest blanket. Nap deliciously, on the sofa, for no more than 20 minutes. Crucially, text your friends. The first rule of Nap Club is: talk about it, a lot. Discovering your friends are slumping mid-afternoon will make you feel less useless. It may also energise you. Nothing turns around a bad night\u2019s sleep like hearing someone else had a worse one. Go to bed earlier Sleep is important, especially as you get older, so why not experiment with an earlier bedtime? This week, try going to bed an hour earlier than you usually do. What are you going to miss? Newsnight? You\u2019ll get over it. Do things you don\u2019t want to, eagerly Plans made in excitement can find us feeling less than enthusiastic when their due date rolls around. It\u2019s good to be realistic, yet we often expend more energy complaining about insufficient energy than we do on the journey or social effort. In all probability, you are going to do the thing, so do it with your whole heart. Don\u2019t see family and friends resentfully, because they\u2019ll feel it. Get the most out of whatever these occasions offer \u2013 there\u2019s always something. You can complain afterwards, if you still want to. Most times, you won\u2019t. Turn your home into a spa A bath, with candles. Body scrub, face masks. Relaxing playlist. Above all, permission. Set aside an afternoon or evening. If they\u2019re not awful at it, get your partner to give you a massage. The best things in life are not free, but you can definitely get all this for about \u00a310. Change the lights When LED bulbs start to fail, the light they give out sort of\u2026 sours. The temperature of the room falls. Recommended: Philips Dimmable A60 LED bulbs. Eat fashionably seasonally People who eat seasonally are forever telling others they should, too. They don\u2019t really want them to, though, as then they wouldn\u2019t be special. But here\u2019s the rub. We all should eat seasonally \u2013 and not just for point-scoring. Fruit and veg that travel the fewest miles come loaded with the most nutrients and zingy minerals, and will supercharge you. Think of it as seasonal fashion. Apples and Jerusalem artichokes are very in right now. Perfect a new but useless skill Learn the Eurasian screech owl call; or a magic trick; or how to walk a coin across your knuckles, or play Eye of the Tiger by flicking your cheeks. A nice, sedentary, time-intensive trick that will garner you minor, perhaps odd, but still significant kudos at parties. Stop buying new clothes It\u2019s easier than you think, now there\u2019s Vestiaire and Vinted. Make the seller an offer they can\u2019t refuse \u2013 on Vinted you can offer up to 40% below the asking price. Get some sheepskin inner soles When winter is properly bedded in, \u00a35 for a spring in your step is a bargain. Scent your bedroom like a hotel Either splash out on a luxe diffuser or make your own water spray with ingredients like witch hazel with lemon, clove or lavender essential oils. Drink more, achieve more Drink way more water than you usually would. Sure, hydration is good for energy, but nothing focuses the mind like really, really needing a wee. Why not set yourself a task, and refuse to allow yourself to go to the toilet until it\u2019s been completed? You\u2019ll get it done in record time. Make like a squirrel In a recent TikTok, actor Jennifer Garner became hysterical laughing at how many packets of nuts she had squirrelled away in her handbag (eight). Garner has the right idea though: research on their benefits appears constantly, for both physical and cognitive health. Eat nuts! Plot a (very) slow art crawl Get more beauty into your life: if there\u2019s an artist whose work you enjoy, explore where you could see more of it, then plan trips over the next year, or even decade. If you love Bellini, say, there are beautiful works of his in London, Birmingham and Glasgow. But why not start dreaming of a trip to his hometown of Venice, too? Living in the moment is great, but having plans to look forward to can really switch the lights on when things feel dark. Create professional boundaries Nothing depletes a person like receiving a work email out of office hours, and knowing you\u2019re expected to reply promptly. Set up an out-of-office at the end of every working day, basically saying: \u201cI\u2019ll reply to this tomorrow when I start work again.\u201d Suddenly you have tons more time to spend on other things, like fretting that your boss is going to fire you for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Think vertically Anyone who is planning to throw off the laziness and gluttony of the past month will be thinking about getting fitter. But plodding round the streets, often in the dark and the rain, is no fun. Instead, next time you are in the office, head for the emergency stairwell and start running up the stairs, two or three at a time. It\u2019s high intensity, builds speed, power and cardiovascular fitness, and helps with agility, balance and foot speed. It also means you can boast about being on the cusp of a new fad: vertical marathons. Scream your head off If you are feeling stifled, take a lesson from the tantruming two-year-old and let it all out at the top of your voice. There\u2019s good evidence that \u201cprimal scream therapy\u201d works on many levels, but you don\u2019t need to worry about that. Just go to a field, garden, park or cupboard under the stairs and shout as loud as you can. You will feel instantly empowered. Avoid dry January Do we need to say more? Yes, drink in moderation, but denial is going to give you the opposite of a well-needed boost. Go for a swing This has to be the easiest of all. Next time you walk past a playground, pop in and sit on a swing. The zen-like repetition, the feeling in your tummy, the sheer silliness of it is wonderfully life-affirming. Better still, it\u2019s good for you, you are outdoors and you\u2019re living in the moment.

Behind him is an oil painting of his father, a prop created for a film, which required \u201cdynastic portraits\u201d of his relatives. \u201cI liked my father fine, so, there he is.\u201d We are talking on Zoom and he spins the camera round. \u201cBut look, even better! Here\u2019s the counterpoint. Do you see that?\u201d To the side of him is a large, lightbox photograph of his friend and occasional collaborator, the artist Marina Abramovi\u0107, standing priest-like over a naked body adorned with organs. \u201cAnyway, you get the idea,\u201d he says. Dafoe is less the kind of actor who wants to discuss his three-hour morning workout routine and more the type who will get stuck into the bigger stuff. We are here to talk about Poor Things, the stunning new Yorgos Lanthimos film, based on the novel by Alasdair Gray. Dafoe stars as a reclusive genius scientist named Godwin Baxter \u2013 God, for short \u2013 who creates life in the form of Emma Stone\u2019s Bella. It is a gorgeous, thrilling adventure and it could be the film to earn Dafoe, who slaps on heavy prosthetics to play God, his fifth Oscar nomination. His first was for Platoon, in 1987, and he has been working solidly, voraciously even, since 1980, making more than 150 films in five decades, with every interesting director in the business, from David Lynch to Wes Anderson, from Werner Herzog to Paul Schrader and Martin Scorsese. Dafoe, 68, is back in New York only briefly. He first moved to the city in 1977, when he was 22, because he wanted to be a commercial theatre actor, but he fell in with an arty crowd and joined an experimental theatre collective called the Wooster Group instead. It was there he met his first partner, with whom he had a son in 1982. He\u2019s lived in New York on and off since then, though less so now. In the early 00s, he married an Italian woman, the director Giada Colagrande, 48, with whom he now lives in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like I go back to a different life than I have normally,\u201d he says. He has Italian friends, Italian family, speaks Italian. And then there are the animals. We were due to speak in the summer, but Poor Things was pushed back due to the actors\u2019 strike, which also meant that Dafoe stopped working for almost four months. \u201cI love to work,\u201d he says, \u201cand it was longer than I like to go.\u201d But it was fine, mostly, because of his small farm. \u201cI never know how much to talk about this,\u201d he says, a little warily. \u201cBasically, let\u2019s say, I was a gentleman farmer.\u201d I am sure I am not the only one who would like to know more. \u201cOh, OK. Well, maybe you\u2019ll get a little out of me.\u201d Dafoe had never even had pets before, but now, he has \u201clots of animals\u201d and a vegetable garden, just outside Rome. Why does he keep animals? \u201cI\u2019m basically a vegetarian, so I do it just for the pleasure of their company and to try to give them a good life, which is a little naive.\u201d They take eggs from the chickens and turkeys, and wool from the sheep and alpacas. At one point he refers to \u201cother people\u201d on the farm. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he says, catching himself. \u201cOther people!\u201d He means the animals. A few months ago, Dafoe\u2019s Poor Things co-star Mark Ruffalo posted a picture of the two of them with an alpaca, which briefly lit up the internet. So that was your alpaca? He nods. \u201cA baby. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Do they have personalities? \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the whole thing. Each one is very distinct. With sheep and goats, some you know well, some have names and they really stick, but some are just sheep and goats. But every alpaca, you have a whole particular relationship with, and you know their character.\u201d The gentleman farmer sounds like a very different lifestyle to either Hollywood or the New York theatre scene. \u201cIt is, but still, it\u2019s like being at the theatre. I wake up, I hit the ground running. My day is dedicated to doing things and taking care of things. Idle hands are the devil\u2019s workshop, what can I tell ya?\u201d He grins. \u201cAnother reason I don\u2019t like to talk about it is, I remember one of the first movies I was in.\u201d It was called Heaven\u2019s Gate, in 1980. \u201cI had never been in a studio or Hollywood movie before. I was used to being with the downtown crowd in New York, in a very fertile period. When I went on set, I thought everybody would be talking about poetry and film and philosophy. And everybody was talking about their dogs and their horses and their ranches, and I thought, this is a drag, ya know? And now, I\u2019ve become one of them.\u201d Dafoe has always existed between the mainstream and an artier scene, adjusting the balance over the years. There has been much mythologising of New York City in 1977. Was he part of that world? \u201cI was very much there, but we also were kind of insular, in the respect that it was a tough life and it was hard to survive. We didn\u2019t have the money to hang out at Max\u2019s Kansas City all the time. You would go to CBGBs, you\u2019d go to Mudd Club, but it wasn\u2019t a regular thing.\u201d When he first arrived, he was fresh from touring Europe with a travelling theatre company, and he thought he would become a professional stage actor. \u201cBut I found myself not being interested in pursuing that and hanging out with people that had very little ambition. Not until later did people really become kind of careerist about it. Because there was no career to be had, there was no audience for it.\u201d Clearly, he has had a long and successful career himself. Was there snobbery around the idea of success? \u201cOf course. Because grabbing at the brass ring \u2013 the brass ring was bullshit, you know? Why grab? Make our own brass ring. I think there was some truth to that.\u201d Dafoe has worked with scores of directors, many of whom have used him to challenging effect, whether in the psychosexual horrors of Lars von Trier or the earthy folk terrors of Robert Eggers; he has played Jesus Christ, starred in Antichrist. But he has done plenty of blockbusters in his time, from Speed 2 to Spider-Man. If it doesn\u2019t sound rude, I say, you have sort of grabbed at the brass ring, too. \u201cYeah, and listen, I\u2019ve been very fortunate. But I do want to say that I\u2019m always amazed when people have some success and they\u2019re kind of in denial, and still treat themselves as outsiders.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI find that kind of rude. I don\u2019t want to be that guy.\u201d I want to know what Dafoe thinks about the movies today. He has pointed out before that when he did Spider-Man, in 2002, it was an anomaly: movies weren\u2019t really made from comic books then. Now, superheroes dominate and many argue that between the blockbusters and the arthouse, there\u2019s no middle ground left. At first, he demurs and says he doesn\u2019t really think about it, because, as always, he\u2019s too busy working. But then he warms up. \u201cWhen something like the strike happens, I wake up and say, \u2018Listen, baby, you got to figure some of this stuff out,\u2019 because otherwise you\u2019re driving blind, you know?\u201d Listen, baby, this is what Dafoe has figured out. The easy one, he says, is that people watch films differently now, at home, rather than at the cinemas, which are closing down. \u201cWhich is tragic, because the kind of attention that people give at home isn\u2019t the same. More difficult movies, more challenging movies can not do as well, when you don\u2019t have an audience that\u2019s really paying attention. That\u2019s a big thing. I miss the social thing of where movies fit in the world. You go see a movie, you go out to dinner, you talk about it later, and that spreads out. People now go home, they say, \u2018Hey, honey, let\u2019s watch something stupid tonight,\u2019 and they flip through and they watch five minutes of 10 movies, and they say, forget it, let\u2019s go to bed. Where\u2019s that discourse found?\u201d The studios have changed, too. \u201cThey aren\u2019t making movies the same way they used to. They\u2019re being financed by toy companies and other entities, and they become the vehicle to make the movies, because they know how to do that. Streaming, they\u2019re becoming like a monopoly, they have the means of production and distribution. And so it\u2019s very complicated.\u201d He says again that he doesn\u2019t really know anything, that his friends who work in Hollywood more know better than him. \u201cI\u2019m a crummy source, a lousy source, to have a really good overview on what has changed.\u201d It sounds like he has a good overview to me. \u201cJust socially,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t really know the business part of it. I just noticed that there\u2019s been a proliferation of middlemen. There aren\u2019t ballsy producers like there used to be. There are some savvy ones, but you don\u2019t have the same kind of characters that you used to have, that would sell their house to make a movie, and do crazy things to get it done. They\u2019re a little harder to find.\u201d Dafoe always has several projects on the go. Another of the films he made recently is Gonzo Girl, Patricia Arquette\u2019s directorial debut, which sees him playing one of those crazy types, not a producer, but a Hunter S Thompson-esque writer, whose creativity has long since been subsumed by excess. He has a different name, but is very much based on Thompson. \u201cOf course, we borrow a lot from the real-life character, but I never wanted to do an imitation. That\u2019s why biopics that try to do an imitation always drive me crazy, because it ultimately becomes a show of the actor. Somewhere that embarrasses me and repels me. Really. And the actors that repel me are ones that are too needy.\u201d In an industry stuffed with inflated egos, then, it sounds as if Dafoe\u2019s ego is pretty healthy. \u201cI hope what you say is true,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course, we need an ego to get out of bed. To want to do things, we have to have some sense of self. But we don\u2019t want to delude ourselves to think that we\u2019re one thing, to be inflexible, to think that we\u2019re special.\u201d Is he a spiritual person? \u201cOh, God,\u201d he says, mock-appalled, but he indulges the question. \u201cListen. I\u2019m interested in spiritual impulse, and I\u2019m interested in religious thought, but you can\u2019t talk about these things publicly, and you shouldn\u2019t talk about them, because then you fall into the trap of making that your identity.\u201d For example, he\u2019s been doing yoga for 40 years and sometimes it comes up in interviews. It\u2019s a big part of his life. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like to talk about it, because every time you bring it up, if someone doesn\u2019t have the same reference, you\u2019re kind of saying, you\u2019re missing out, you don\u2019t have it, this is a beautiful thing for me, and then you just want to kill yourself! For being an asshole!\u201d Is it better, as an actor, to have people know nothing about you? \u201cI think that\u2019s true. I know that when I know someone has really repellent politics, it changes how I watch them.\u201d When he is talking about Poor Things, he is often asked about the prosthetics. \u201cThe second I hear myself saying, \u2018Yeah, it took four hours to get in and two hours to get out, and I was there at 3am\u2026\u2019 You don\u2019t want people thinking about that when they\u2019re watching the movie.\u201d I wonder if Dafoe, with his 150-plus movies and his theatre and his art and his alpacas, is easily bored. \u201cNot at all!\u201d he replies, immediately. \u201cI\u2019m never bored. In fact, it\u2019s probably the greatest feature of getting older. When I was younger, I was bored and restless a lot. I always have things I want to do and there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day.\u201d This sounds like a nice state to live in. \u201cIt\u2019s only come as I\u2019ve gotten older and other things have gone as I\u2019ve gotten older, and it\u2019s a good trade-off, I\u2019d say.\u201d What has he lost? \u201cNot much, you know, maybe a little muscle tone and thickness of eyebrows and your lips get thinner. No, I\u2019m joking, but I\u2019m not joking\u2026\u201d He laughs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, it feels like an open road much more. Once you get further down the line, you start to think about the under-the-line a lot more.\u201d He used to be the youngest person in every group. \u201cNow I\u2019m the oldest. I read all the time about people I\u2019ve worked with dying, and it\u2019s like, what happened? And it\u2019s like, well, they were 82 years old,\u201d he says. Younger people are often motivated by a need to find their place in the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s no accident that there are different stages of life and I don\u2019t have a preference for one or the other, but not everything has to happen when you\u2019re young. A lot can happen later.\u201d It sounds as if Dafoe has never been busier. He is about to start work on another film, with the former associate director of the Young Vic, Nadia Latif. He has already finished another film with Lanthimos and Stone. And then there is Beetlejuice 2. A couple of days earlier, Dafoe had let slip that he is playing an undead detective. \u201cDo me a favour,\u201d he says, annoyed at himself. \u201cI said this two days ago, and I regret it, because it occurs to me that Tim Burton is probably one of those people who doesn\u2019t like people to talk about the movie. I think he probably thought, \u2018That fucker, he should have kept his mouth shut!\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cI had a weak moment, ya know! I spilled the beans, as they say.\u201d Fashion editor Helen Seamons; grooming by Jennie Roberts at Frank Agency using Woolf Kings X and Glossier; Fashion assistant Sam Deaman; tailor Nick James; photography assistants Alex Cornes, Philip Banks and Brandon Hepworth; shot at Stockwell Studio.

The findings come as hundreds of thousands of people across the UK join or rejoin a gym, swimming pool or leisure centre as part of a new year resolution to improve their fitness. Survey findings commissioned by ukactive, which represents fitness operators, found that 55% of gym-goers felt their membership was important in helping them manage a short- or long-term health condition. And more than three in four (78%) said that going to the gym has a positive impact on their mental health and wellbeing, while two-thirds (66%) said they found that exercising helps them to sleep better. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that more people are seeing the true value of being active and its role in leading a fulfilling life,\u201d said Huw Edwards, ukactive\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to see people getting such crucial benefits from physical activity and more are now seeing fitness and leisure facilities as places in the community that can really help them look after their health and wellbeing.\u201d About 10.3 million people in the UK belong to a gym. Early January usually sees a surge in people joining because they have decided to try to get fitter but not everyone keeps up the habit. \u201cBecoming more active and achieving a healthy weight is known to provide long-term benefits to people and their communities,\u201d said Matthew Fagg, NHS England\u2019s director for prevention and long-term conditions, responding to the findings. The NHS uses physical activity as a key element of its programmes to help diabetics manage their condition, smokers to quit and the overweight to slim down, he added. Edwards urged ministers to do more to support the fitness industry, especially with a record 2.6 million Britons currently unable to work because they are struggling with an illness. Employers should be able to offer staff gym memberships or home fitness equipment as a perk and then claim the costs against tax, he said. He also called for an overhaul of VAT to incentivise gym membership \u2013 as Ireland has done \u2013 and a reform of business rates to encourage more gyms, pools and fitness facilities to open. Andy Bell, the chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said: \u201cPhysical activity has been shown to benefit our mental health. And people living with a long-term physical health condition are twice as likely to have a mental health difficulty. \u201cBut access to leisure facilities and green spaces isn\u2019t equal, and people with the poorest mental health often have the least access to opportunities for physical activity.\u201d But David Minton, a leisure industry analyst, said that gyms are doing too little to attract more people not aged between 16 and 34, who are the group most likely to be a member. They should also target older people with high cholesterol or musculoskeletal problems, he said. \u201cAs a species we are very poor at adopting simple behaviours that are proven to improve our healthy mobility. The fitness industry needs to adopt a fresh approach to both language and marketing to attract a wider audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIn January many new people will find a sense of purpose whilst improving their healthy mobility.

He fails to recognise that green belts are there to prevent most new development as a matter of principle, irrespective of its design quality. Green belts were not established to protect agricultural land, nor were they concerned with \u201camenity value\u201d. Established in 1955, the original purpose of green belts was \u201cto check the growth of a large built up area, to prevent neighbouring settlements from merging into another, or to preserve the special character of a town\u201d. In the 1980s the then Greater Manchester council, when drawing up the first comprehensive green belt for the conurbation, established a further critical purpose, namely to assist in urban regeneration \u2013 an objective subsequently adopted nationally by the Conservative government, despite being vigorously opposed by the big housebuilders of the day (something I remember well as a planner defending our approach at a 60-day public inquiry). Green belts are established as part of a rational local planning process, fully engaging with communities, and subject to rigorous public examination. While, once in place, they are certainly expected to be valid for the long term, like any other planning policy, they are subject to periodic review \u2013 as indeed has happened in Greater Manchester, where (after about 40 years) some adjustments to the boundaries have been made in order to reflect current housing and economic requirements. To suggest simplistically, as both the main political parties are doing, that an evidence-based policy such as green belt designation is the reason for the housing crisis (and thus that the planning system is \u201cbroken\u201d) simply makes an honest examination of the multiple failures of the last 14 years even more unlikely. David Kaiserman Wilmslow, Cheshire \u2022 It\u2019s not possible, as Nicholas Boys Smith seems to believe, to talk intelligently about housing and development without mentioning either genuinely social (ie not \u201caffordable\u201d) housing or developers\u2019 profits and their contributions to politicians. Developers prefer to \u201cchuck a cul-de-sac in a field\u201d, as he says, because greenfield land (not necessarily green belt) is cheaper to develop, and people are willing to buy the resulting houses with their three parking spaces and no public transport nearby. They build at low density because detached housing is somehow aspirational. They already use pattern books, as Boys Smith recommends, just not good ones. Georgian and Victorian pattern books gave a range of dwelling provision, with carefully thought-out facilities and spacing, and subtle changes of decoration \u2013 a little like the Parker Morris standards that the Thatcher government ditched. But however many planning permissions developers are given, they will never develop at a rate that risks undermining their profits. Gordon Brown and his economic adviser on housing, Kate Barker, both believed that all that was necessary to make prices affordable was to build in sufficient volume. That magical thinking has blighted planning ever since. And the housebuilders\u2019 contributions to the Tory party especially have blighted any hope of better provision. Starmer\u2019s proposal to cut the discounts available on right to buy for any remaining council houses is a step in the right direction. But the only solution for the millions of people of all ages living without secure housing is to build council housing once more, and return to the original intention that it should be normal tenure, not a desperate last measure for those with no other option. And restore the ability of councils to design and manage it, reversing the last 40 years of outsourcing and downgrading of local authorities. That will be a long slog, but it\u2019s essential.

It can slide off like Teflon or land right where, and when, you need it. Back in 2017 my mate Kearnsie had popped round for a cuppa and a chat. As we sat in the sunny kitchen with tea and bickies, I looked through the goodies she\u2019d brought along for my wife and I\u2019s pending arrival. After four years of trying, our first kid was on the way. Blooming beautifully in my wife\u2019s belly. We knew everything would change, and to be frank, we were freaking out. Kearnsie had brought some special bits and bobs she\u2019d saved from when her kids were little: gorgeous vintage overalls and tiny terry-towelling T-shirts. It wasn\u2019t all she gave us that day. As we leaned in to absorb the answers to questions we fired off about every potential need this baby would have, we hungrily took mental notes. Thankfully someone around here knew what they were doing. The chat changed direction and we started musing about our identities as fully formed adults with our own needs and wants. When would we be able to be us again, as a couple and as individuals? Was that time over? It was a simple phrase but one that hit like a lightning bolt. She said it like it was no big deal. \u201cYou\u2019re still you, but with kids.\u201d Oh! It hadn\u2019t occurred to either of us, really. I had grappled with this idea that I would have to disappear, to be a carbon copy of my mother (lovely as she is), to sacrifice everything I need to feel alive and safe. But Kearnsie had given me this epic yet simple reassurance \u2013 I\u2019m still me \u2026 with kids. That baby has just wrapped up their first year at school. It\u2019s been a huge success with lots of friends and a new reading habit. Just like they\u2019ve found their own groove outside our home and away from us, when the time was right my partner and I did the same. We\u2019ve both had career changes that followed our interests, and faced the requisite existential crises and rapid life changes people tend to at this stage of the game. When we\u2019d approach one another with a fanciful idea and felt a bit shy about making these leaps, the other would gently offer a reminder. \u201cRemember Kearnsie? You\u2019re you, with kids.\u201d Inhabiting who we are has helped us thrive. It wasn\u2019t just the big moments either. When a baby-shaped sleepy potato pudding joins your family, the first stretch is spent in protection mode. How do we best keep this person alive and flourishing? It\u2019s easy to forget that you have a spine that needs to be held at a certain angle to prevent ongoing crushing agony. Many a midnight I whispered to myself \u201cI\u2019m me, with a baby\u201d as I strapped my fussy babe into the gentle automated rocker we found on marketplace. I was present and protecting both of us, seeing the way we both had needs. As we got to know each other, I learned my baby\u2019s rhythms and knew when the rocker could stand in and when I could gather them up in my arms to deposit safely in their cot. We\u2019d both get a better night\u2019s sleep and be ready to roll as the sun came up. Needs will never be in short supply in any household. Rapid change and endless days and nights are all part and parcel of parenting, and if you don\u2019t check in with yourself it\u2019s easy for your awareness of your own needs to disappear.

How come? Well, it\u2019s an unusually strong year, especially in the categories Barbie had the best shot in: Margot Robbie was never realistically going to beat Emma Stone (for Poor Things), who herself looks now likely to be knocked out by Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019s Lily Gladstone for the best female actor prize when it\u2019s not split between comedy and drama. There may also be a sense that, although the great pink saviour did wonderful things for cinema, she oughtn\u2019t to hog all the glory as well as the cash and buzz. Leaning to Oppenheimer instead allows for the concession that press and popularity are a good thing, but keeps things donnish too. Anyway, sadly, Sunday\u2019s snub does bode badly for Barbie. After all, if the Globes weren\u2019t going to give the nod to Ryan Gosling for his definition-of-a-supporting-turn (the supporting actor award went to Robert Downey Jr for Oppenheimer), then more august bodies are unlikely to. Maestro could benefit from its Globes cold-shouldering Bradley Cooper\u2019s decade-in-the-prep transformation into Leonard Bernstein would traditionally have fast-tracked him to being smothered in silverware. But he was shunned in favour of Cillian Murphy \u2013 a popular winner, but not so much of a lock that the sympathy vote might not give Cooper (who has now lost six times at the Globes) the edge later in the race. Don\u2019t discount The Holdovers Classy and charming speeches from Paul Giamatti and Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph will only fuel the bonhomie felt in Hollywood for Alexander Payne\u2019s intimate comedy-drama: a movie less potentially polarising than Oppenheimer, Poor Things or Killers of the Flower Moon. A minority dislike each of those three. The Holdovers seems to leave nobody cold. Might it yet split the vote at the Oscars? Christmas party season is still going strong in Hollywood The stars were a little thin on the ground at last year\u2019s Globes, and those who did show up looked slightly unsure whether they should have. This year, everyone and their mother rocked up and looked ecstatic to be doing so. The whole awards season this year is defined by a post-strike headiness, and there is a palpable sense of enjoyment in the usual conveyor belt of interviews and red carpet opportunities which bespeaks of a thousand showboats grounded for many months. People seem genuinely pleased to see each other, and to talk about their work. Can this be sustained another two months until the Oscars? A test of acting prowess may be required. Politics is not on the agenda The hot water some stars found themselves in after wading in with their opinions on the Israel-Gaza war may have acted as a considerable deterrent to anyone who fancied having their say at the ceremony. But after so many references last year to the Globes\u2019s own racism, as well as Ukraine, as well as the long-bubbling anti-Trump nods, perhaps serious hat fatigue had set in. The closest we got were Gladstone using her speech to speak Blackfeet and reflect that \u201cNative actors used to speak their lines in English and then the sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera\u201d. That and Gillian Anderson\u2019s anatomical frock. The Globes still don\u2019t know a good thing when they have it Get Taylor Swift in the room \u2013 great! But then give her neither a prize nor a chance to air her pipes, and add insult to injury with a terrible joke \u2013 not so good. The producers of this year\u2019s show exposed their lack of judgment with endless missteps, not confined to hiring Jo Koy as the worst awards host in living memory. His lack of panache was highlighted by the smooth success of the presenting skits by the likes of Will Ferrell and Kirsten Wiig \u2013 and by the Globes\u2019s most successful host, Ricky Gervais, picking up the new standup prize. Jennifer Lawrence is still an awards season asset Up for female comedy actor for her role in the knockabout sex comedy No Hard Feelings, Lawrence \u2013 who didn\u2019t have a shot \u2013 gamely mouthed \u201cIf I don\u2019t win, I\u2019m leaving\u201d to the reaction camera which every other nominee studiously attempts to ignore when their name is read out. Second prize in the casual-knowingness-about-camera-placement awards goes to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Kylie Jenner, who splashily canoodled in the ad breaks. The new voters are properly international Much of the original, tainted, 90-odd membership of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association were binned along with the name (despite a few confused speeches still hat-tipping them), with a properly foreign and diverse 180 or so taking their place. Whoever the new voters are, they do have some taste, giving the best animation prize to The Boy and the Heron, and lock-stepping with the Cannes jury over Justine Triet\u2019s courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall, which took best screenplay as well as best foreign language film and now looks a certainty for a best picture Oscar nomination. Meryl Streep can lose Never bet against Meryl Streep \u2013 but maybe if you do, put down a lot of cash. Few could have foreseen Streep would be denied a record-setting 10th Globe win for her turn in Only Murders in the Building, and fewer still that she\u2019d be trounced by Elizabeth Debicki as Ghost Diana in The Crown.

This mashup of magical realism, gratuitous violence and sentimentality is an atrocity in filmic form. It\u2019s only a bit offensive for its appropriation of the Holocaust as a dramatic engine. What really stirs revulsion is the film\u2019s smug delusions of quality, a self-belief so strong that it has the gall to take two hours and 21 minutes to unfurl itself to the end. Everyone who whined about Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon being too long should be strapped to a chair, like Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, and forced to watch this in order to understand the difference between a film that\u2019s long because it has a lot to say and one that actively seeks to make its viewers stupider after watching it. So here\u2019s the plot. The year is 1943 and the small Mezza Piotta circus has set up in Rome. Run by kindly impresario Israel (Giorgio Tirabassi), the circus stars are an assortment of so-called freaks, a quartet with X-Men/Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children/Angela Carter-like abilities. Cencio (Pietro Castellitto) can control insects with his mind, although he has issues with bees. Mario (Giancarlo Martini) is a clown human magnet. Fulvio (Claudio Santamaria) is covered in hair like a cheap Chewbacca costume but has superhuman strength. Finally, ingenue Matilde (Aurora Giovinazzo) is so full of electricity that she shocks anyone who touches her \u2013 except when she doesn\u2019t because the script is terminally lazy. When Israel is hauled away east to the death camps and the gang are separated, Matilde embarks on a picaresque adventure to find them all. Meanwhile, there is a Nazi circus ringmaster in town named Franz (Franz Rogowski) who likes to huff ether because it gives him visions of the future (don\u2019t try this at home, kids); he also has extra pinkies on each hand which enables him to play Creep by Radiohead very fast on the piano. Franz wants to capture the players from the Mezza Piotta who he\u2019s seen in his visions and do mean stuff to them \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly clear what his goal is. Rogowski has been showered with praise for his performances of late, especially as a polyamorous narcissist in Passages, but any awards bodies thinking of bestowing prizes on him may wish to reconsider if they see his silly mugging and gurning in this, leaping about antically like a labradoodle chasing a Chuckit! ball. Sidenote: it\u2019s also offensive the way this Italian film pushes the entirety of the blame for Jewish persecution on to the Germans, as if Mussolini and the 1938 racial laws didn\u2019t even exist, and posits that all Italians are nice and it\u2019s just those beastly Teutons from up north who did everything.

On the one hand, he is about to appear in his first big movie role, in the delightfully surreal and sexed-up fantasia Poor Things. After his hit comedy drama series Ramy, it looks like the beginning of a new phase in his career. On the other hand, the Israel-Gaza war is dominating the news, and as one of the most prominent Muslim entertainers out there, Egyptian American Youssef is very much in the spotlight. These two worlds are colliding the day we meet in December. Youssef is tangentially in the headlines as a result of Taylor Swift having attended his standup show in New York a few days previously, with celebrity friends Selena Gomez and Cara Delevingne. Youssef is donating all the proceeds from the remainder of his standup tour to the Palestinian NGO American Near East Refugee Aid. This was too much for the rightwing presenter Megyn Kelly, who declared that Swift \u201cowes Israelis and Jewish Americans an apology\u201d, and urged people to \u201cboycott her events until she issues one\u201d, telling Swift \u201cwhen it comes to talking about those issues again, you clearly know nothing\u201d. Never mind that it was actually Youssef doing the talking, not Swift \u2013 it\u2019s an illustration of how difficult it is for him to simply enjoy his rising stardom. As we talk at a London hotel, saccharine Christmas music playing in the background, the conversation often lurches between lighthearted and deadly serious, although anyone who has watched Ramy will know that Youssef is well accustomed to this mode. \u201cI don\u2019t pay much attention to it,\u201d he says of the Megyn Kelly stuff, leaning in close on the sofa. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the act of helping innocent people getting politicised, and then it turning into this whole other thing, so I don\u2019t really give it much time.\u201d He describes Swift as \u201ca new friend\u201d \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s really funny, actually, and really cool.\u201d It\u2019s easy to assume that Youssef is just like Ramy, the character he plays on TV, but five years and three seasons on, the two identities are diverging ever further. \u201cRamy\u201d is an aimless but likable New Jersey millennial, still living with his immigrant parents and working for his gem-trader uncle, forever trying to reconcile Muslim and western values, but usually too weak to transcend his shallow desires (those puppy-dog eyes make him quite the hit with the ladies). \u201cThe show is really just about higher self and lower self,\u201d Youssef says. \u201cIt\u2019s about who we want to be and who we actually are.\u201d In real life, 32-year-old Youssef is now a writer, producer and director (as well as episodes of his own show, he has directed an episode of The Bear), as well as an actor and a comic. He has won awards and critical adulation, he\u2019s hanging with the likes of Swift and the model Bella Hadid (who had a guest role on Ramy), and now he\u2019s on the big screen punching Mark Ruffalo and having his ear licked by Emma Stone. Any apprehension Youssef might have had about stepping on to a movie set was dispelled during three weeks of \u201ccrazy theatre games\u201d that Poor Things director Yorgos Lanthimos arranged before shooting. \u201cThe rehearsal for all of us knocked out any impostor syndrome we might have had,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the time we got to shoot, it almost felt like you had embarrassed yourself so much over the last three weeks that there was nothing to be afraid of.\u201d What kind of games? \u201cYou know, physical stuff. Rolling around on the floor, doing an interpretive dance on cue, things that you would be a little shy to do in front of your improv group, and now you\u2019re doing them in front of Willem Dafoe.\u201d He describes making Poor Things as \u201ca surreal dream\u201d, which is a fair description of the movie itself. Adapted from Alasdair Gray\u2019s 1992 novel, and set in a parallel 1880s Europe, the film is a singular mix of gothic horror and absurdist comedy, with an avowedly feminist stance. Stone\u2019s shameless heroine, Bella, is an experiment of Dafoe\u2019s mad scientist, who sets off on her own journey of intellectual and sexual self-discovery. Youssef plays the essentially sweet-natured Max, who is assigned by Dafoe to first study Bella, then marry her \u2013 though things don\u2019t go at all to plan. \u201cThere\u2019s a really fine line between him being sincere and him being creepy,\u201d says Youssef of his character. \u201cAnd I felt, OK, I think I know how to handle this.\u201d Despite being largely set in Britain, Poor Things\u2019 main stars are all American. \u201cWe had this great moment on set where Christopher Abbott [who plays Alfie] was like, \u2018Dude, it\u2019s always the Brits playing the Americans. And now we\u2019re doing it!\u2019. He was so happy. It was like, finally, we got one on the board.\u201d Youssef nails the English accent impressively. One of his best buddies is a British Cypriot from Barnet, north-west London, he explains: \u201cI realised when I started working on the accent, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m copying him.\u2019\u201d Acting beyond Ramy was always part of the plan. \u201cI\u2019ve been really fortunate how well the show\u2019s been received, but I think in the back of my head I also knew, yeah, my name is Ramy and I\u2019m playing Ramy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that there\u2019s this whole other realm of acting where you really just step into a character.\u201d When he was 20, Youssef dropped out of university to enrol in acting school in New York, but his early career failed to launch. \u201cWhen I was auditioning before, no one ever really knew what to do with me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be like, \u2018You\u2019re not quite ethnic enough to do the ethnic thing.\u2019 And then also, \u2018We\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re the friend or if you\u2019re the lead.\u2019 There was always this ambiguity about what I could do.\u201d This was in the US in the noughties, when largely the only roles available to vaguely \u201cArab\u201d actors were terrorists. Youssef was 10 years old when 9/11 happened, and as a Muslim American, life changed overnight. He later incorporated his childhood memories into a flashback episode of Ramy, including nightmares about Osama bin Laden, and the concurrent emergence of his adolescent sexuality. \u201c9/11 and me jerking off for the first time happened in the same year,\u201d he once said. He began doing standup when he was in high school, with friends including Steve Way, who plays one of his best friends in Ramy and has muscular dystrophy. \u201cI actually sometimes don\u2019t know how funny I was as a kid,\u201d he muses. \u201cI was maybe a bit more in my feelings than funny. I think the humour came by surprise to me when I started making things. I loved videotaping things and editing them, making music videos and writing little sketches with my friends. And little by little, I was like, \u2018Oh, I guess I should be in them.\u2019 And then I started to kind of find this other side of myself, but I\u2019m probably the least funny person in my family. My mom is one of the funniest people I\u2019ve ever met. She can joke between Arabic and English and French and cut up the whole room.\u201d His parents were both born in Cairo but met in New York, where his grandfather was a UN interpreter for 30 years, before settling in New Jersey. The adversity of his upbringing at least gave him a trove of material. In his first appearance on network TV, on Stephen Colbert\u2019s show in 2017, he began by saying: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Ramy Youssef. I\u2019m Muslim \u2026 like, from the news,\u201d before joking that when he turned 30 he expected to get \u201ca Hogwarts letter from Isis\u201d. But one of the strengths of Ramy the show is how it avoids such easy laughs in favour of depth and authenticity. For non-Muslim viewers, it\u2019s a window into a reality and a point of view that had never really been represented in mainstream media \u2013 the complexities of family, integration, prejudices, sex, sexuality, gender, guilt and shame. Some have accused the show of stereotyping, but Youssef says he never sought to speak for an entire culture or religion: \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to do that. There\u2019s too many things to represent. It\u2019s too diverse. I probably could only say I\u2019m representing the act of being really messy while seeking.\u201d For all its specificity, though, there is much that is universal about Ramy. \u201cThe amount of people I\u2019ve had come up to me who go, \u2018Dude, your family\u2019s just like my family in Ohio, or in Jamaica,\u2019 or, \u2018Your uncle [Naseem, who is a rabid antisemite] is just like my uncle, except he\u2019s Jewish and hates Muslims,\u2019\u201d says Youssef. \u201cThat stuff is everywhere. America is so diverse in its thinking, its liberalism and conservatism, and it\u2019s not really sectioned off to any area. Go 30 minutes out of any city, and you\u2019re gonna find what you think is really far from you.\u201d Still, he says, that doesn\u2019t stop anyone from \u201csectioning off\u201d groups of people on every scale, from supposedly crime-ridden neighbourhoods to Israel and Palestine. Many of Youssef\u2019s co-stars and crew have Palestinian roots, including Mohammed Amer (who was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents), who plays one of his friends, and the Succession star Hiam Abbass, who plays his mother, who is French Palestinian. Or, indeed, Hadid, who has Palestinian Dutch heritage. \u201cI think a lot of people feel incredibly unsafe,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people have lost family, between our cast members and American friends who have family in Gaza.\u201d Youssef made an episode of Ramy\u2019s third season in Israel and Palestine in mid-2022, working with Palestinian actors and crew members. It was a politically tense time even then, he recalls. The Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh was shot and killed by Israeli forces while they were there \u2013 the entire production attended her funeral. In the resultant episode, though, the geopolitics are just a backdrop to Ramy\u2019s selfish mission to cross into East Jerusalem to hook up with a Tinder date, brandishing his American passport at border security to try to jump the queue. \u201cThe Palestinians are pissed at him, the Israelis are pissed at him, and the other thing I really wanted to highlight was just his privilege as an American,\u201d says Youssef. \u201cI wanted to put a spotlight on dynamics that \u2026 obviously they pain me and I see something skewed, but at the same time, how do I link that to my own complicity with it? Because I think that\u2019s always the most interesting way to look at a problem: like, how do I shift this dynamic?\u201d This is what he\u2019s always seeking to do, he says: \u201cI always think about, how do we personalise these large, global things that feel like they\u2019re out of our hands? What government dynamics exist in my friendships and in my family?\u201d On a personal level, at least, everything seems to be going in the right direction for Youssef. When he was 17, he was taping flyers to lamp-posts to get people to come to his gigs; now he\u2019s the A-listers\u2019 hot ticket. His cultural reach is still expanding. As well as acting, he is shooting a second standup special for HBO, which is due out next year. Mo, the sitcom he co-created with Amer, has been renewed for a second season. He is also excited about an animated series he is making for Amazon with the South Park writer Pam Brady. It is called #1 Happy Family USA, and again, it is a comic take on a Muslim American family desperately trying to fit in in the early 00s. \u201cWhen we started making this show, I thought that I was examining the past; in the last couple of months, I\u2019ve started to feel like I\u2019m examining now.\u201d Reality comes crashing back into the conversation. After the horrific Hamas attacks last October, Islamophobia is almost worse than it was post-9/11, Youssef says. He finds it shocking \u201cthe way that people are so quick to dehumanise and vilify and think the worst of Arab men \u2013 what they think they can do to other people and what they think they do to Arab women. And the way that people can look at people who, especially in societies like London or America, are your neighbours, they\u2019re your doctors, they\u2019re serving you food, they\u2019ve been next to you, side by side. But you\u2019re ready to believe almost anything about them. I\u2019m surprised and I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d But he refuses to give in to despair. \u201cI\u2019m such an optimist,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that there has been this kind of reaction right now: everyone\u2019s feeling really hurt, horrible things have happened to innocent people and it has created this shocked nervous-system response. I trust that we\u2019re still going to be able to look each other in the eye and have real, grounded conversations that are not fully rooted in fear. And I think that\u2019s where art comes in, because it helps cut through fear.\u201d \u2022 Poor Things is released in cinemas in the UK and Ireland from Friday 12 January \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I had just become a mum and didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d she says. \u201cI had all these questions,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat is a woman? Is this it? I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to be doing.\u201d With poetry, she adds, \u201cyou can say a lot of things and it\u2019s so therapeutic\u201d. Just writing poems was not enough, however. Chisakula wanted to share her stories. She was inspired to do spoken-word poetry \u2013 a genre written to be read out loud and performed \u2013 when she heard I Will Wait For You by Janette\u2026ikz, an American spoken-word poet. Now, she is spearheading efforts to expand the spoken-word scene in Zambia, where she is from. In 2017, she co-founded Word Smash Poetry, a movement for young creative activists across southern Africa. In her own award-winning work, she uses poetry as a tool for activism, focusing on issues including women\u2019s rights, youth, African identity and mental health. \u201cI believe in the beautiful persuasion that art brings to the table,\u201d she says. \u201cArt is a form of protest that leaves no blood. It can be peacefully done but a strong message can be communicated artistically.\u201d Chisakula grew up in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, where she still lives with her two children. Her interest in writing started when she watched the film Titanic as a child. Her dream was to produce screenplays and she had never considered poetry until a friend suggested she give it a go. She has not looked back since. \u201cPoetry is just so beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be a short but inspiring piece; it leaves you thinking and wanting more. I didn\u2019t want to stop.\u201d One of her first poems, Her Place, was an examination of womanhood. She explains: \u201cI wanted to tell my truth. What exactly is womanhood? How am I defining it? What are the things that are not working around it?\u201d In it, she says: \u201cHer place was not of a sex symbol, bed-warmer, a stress reliever or a horny man\u2019s entertainer. And her body was not a museum of statues for show because everything she carried in her body were interconnected parts and inside of her there lived a heart. But they could not realise that and they asked about her place. Her place is on top.\u201d In 2020, Chisakula released a short collection of poems, Africana, written to embrace her identity as a black African. \u201cI always wanted to relocate to the US when I was young,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought the American dream was the dream. There\u2019s no African dream.\u201d She no longer believes this; now she wants to celebrate her home continent. When she was younger, she was made to feel inferior when peers called her skin \u201ctoo dark\u201d; at college she was called \u201cblackie\u201d. She blames colonialism for engendering an inferiority complex among black Africans in Africa. \u201cSome Africans haven\u2019t realised we\u2019re dealing with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to accept your own self is good enough if somebody has convinced you that it\u2019s not.\u201d Over the past five years, Chisakula has seen the spoken-word scene grow in popularity in her home country. It is already well established across southern Africa, she says. From September to December there are poetry festivals \u201cnonstop\u201d across countries including South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. In 2022, the winner of the World Poetry Slam, held in Brussels, was Xabiso Vili from South Africa. This year, the competition will be held in Togo. When she started working with the Word Smash Poetry movement, she was aware of about five poetry organisations. \u201cThere\u2019s a poet on every corner now,\u201d she says. \u201cBack then, it was a bit uncommon; now people are doing it on a larger scale. I see poets at almost every event.\u201d Male poets still outnumber female poets, however. Chisakula believes women struggle to get a foothold in the arts in Zambia. She says: \u201cWomen and girls still shy away from these spaces, they don\u2019t participate as easily.\u201d Last month, the Word Smash Poetry movement hosted its second all-female national poetry slam in Lusaka, which took place during the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence, an annual international campaign that kicks off in late November. There were 12 performers in total; four had returned after performing last year and there were eight new faces, which was a huge achievement, according to Chisakula. The quality of the performances during the slam was also impressive. \u201cThe girls were able to express themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stories were well put; they were loud; they were clear. They had solutions. They were captivating. I\u2019m glad we managed to put that space there to allow a celebration of our stories.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-09", "section": "Global development", "author": "Sarah Johnson", "id": 518, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/854c005e5584467e0824bd1f6d6340d7181bd456/0_103_1500_900/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Amazon workers at new Birmingham site to go on strike over pay", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/09/amazon-workers-birmingham-fulfilment-centre-uk-strike-gmb-union", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.127, "neu": 0.614, "pos": 0.259, "compound": 0.9898}, "body": "Amazon faces fresh industrial action in the UK, after members of the GMB union at a new fulfilment centre in Birmingham voted to strike over pay and conditions later this month. The GMB says \u201cup to 100\u201d workers will take part in the strike at the warehouse, which opened in October \u2013 a small fraction of the total workforce \u2013 but it hopes to use the action to boost the profile of the dispute and recruit more supporters. GMB members at the site have chosen 25 January as their first strike day, exactly one year after a stoppage by workers at Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse, in what was the first action of its kind against the company in the UK. Rachel Fagan, a local GMB organiser, said: \u201cThe industrial chaos Amazon faces isn\u2019t going to disappear; it\u2019s growing every day. One year on from the first strike day the message from GMB members at Amazon is the same: recognise our union and end poverty pay.\u201d Membership in Coventry has increased significantly since that first strike, to more than 1,200, according to the GMB, which has also secured a mandate for industrial action at a site in Rugeley, Staffordshire. The GMB had hoped to win formal recognition in Coventry, but withdrew its application after the regulator, the central arbitration committee, backed Amazon\u2019s claim that the workforce had swelled to 2,700. At the time, the union accused Amazon of drafting in more than 1,000 new workers to skew the decision. The company insisted any new recruitment was due to the demands of the business. Amazon staff in Coventry have taken 28 days of industrial action since the start of last year, culminating in a Black Friday rally in November at which they were joined by fellow Amazon workers from Italy, Germany and the US. The basic rate of pay has increased several times over that period and is due to rise to \u00a312.30 an hour in April, although that falls well short of the \u00a315 an hour the strikers are demanding. Amazon denies the increases have any link with the industrial action, insisting it has always reviewed pay regularly. An Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cJust 19 GMB members out of our 2,000 Sutton Coldfield fulfilment centre colleagues have voted in favour of industrial action. It will cause zero disruption for our customers. \u201cWe regularly review our pay to ensure we offer competitive wages and benefits.

The Loxley site, just outside the village of Dunsfold, has been at the centre of a protracted legal battle over plans by the energy company UK Oil and Gas (Ukog) to sink an exploration well. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has faced criticism after being accused of not sufficiently opposing the scheme since taking his cabinet position. Before becoming chancellor, Hunt had previously said the drilling would \u201ccreate enormous disruption and environmental damage for little if any economic benefit\u201d, and attended protests against the scheme. However, since being appointed to cabinet he has remained quiet. A source close to Hunt said he could not comment on cases subject to judicial review as a government minister, but that his views on the project as a constituency MP are a matter of public record. After the decision, Hunt tweeted: \u201cI am bitterly disappointed to learn that the court of appeal has today refused permission for any further appeal against the Ukog planning consent for the Loxley gas well outside Dunsfold. I stand ready to provide my assistance and support to local communities in any way possible going forwards.\u201d Hunt is under pressure from the Liberal Democrats in his South West Surrey constituency, where he has a majority of 8,000. The local environmental issue has angered many of his constituents, who have complained about the noise and environmental impacts of drilling for gas near the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty. The Liberal Democrats environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: \u201cThis is a shameful outcome. This Conservative government\u2019s policies have resulted in greedy gas barons ripping up the Surrey Hills. They have railroaded this through the courts despite local outrage at the plans. \u201cSurrey\u2019s green land is about to be torn up, proving you simply can\u2019t trust the Conservatives on the environment. As the local MP, Jeremy Hunt must now intervene. He is supporting a policy which will allow his constituency to become an oilfield. Local people will be furious at his silence.\u201d Stephen Sanderson, Ukog\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe are pleased that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has once again dismissed the legal challenge to our Loxley project and has confirmed that its planning consent is entirely lawful, as the company and its counsel has maintained.

It\u2019s being adapted for the cinema by director Matthew Vaughn, who calls it the start of \u201cthe most incredible and original spy franchise since Ian Fleming\u2019s books\u201d. There are all sorts of fun mysteries about Conway herself: who is this secretive author? (One rumour links her to Taylor Swift, which seems unlikely.) The title\u2019s protagonist is young and handsome Aubrey Argylle, who is chilling in Thailand when he sees a plane go down over the jungle and stages a daring rescue. His actions bring him to the attention of the CIA and he\u2019s recruited for a deadly mission. Two things you need to know: as Argylle was raised by nomadic, drug dealer parents, he is fluent in all sorts of languages and brilliant at martial arts. His mission: to stop a supervillain Russian from getting his hands on \u201ca priceless treasure of unrivalled opulence\u201d stolen by the Nazis \u2013 the recovery of which would make him the most powerful man in the world. It\u2019s all hugely melodramatic, rather silly and very entertaining, particularly when Argylle\u2019s training for the mission steps up and he\u2019s sent to places such as Monte Carlo (where \u201cthe most famous lighting choreographer in the world\u201d awaits) and remote Greek monasteries (\u201ca seemingly impossible feat of perseverance and engineering\u201d). Heir to Fleming is pushing it \u2013 I was outraged when, undercover in Monte Carlo after weeks of training under false identities, Argylle and his partner refer to each other by their real names. Did Conway write this while \u201cworking as a waitress in a late-night diner\u201d, as her author blurb says? Or did it come to her \u201cin a febrile dream\u201d while recuperating from an accident, as her author\u2019s note has it? I can\u2019t say, but be prepared: the hype is going to be big. I love a good unreliable narrator story, and Araminta Hall\u2019s One of the Good Guys (Macmillan) is among the best I\u2019ve read in ages. It starts from the perspective of Cole, who has moved to the coast after his marriage ended. He\u2019s heartbroken to have lost Mel, and is trying to make a fresh start without her. He\u2019s caring and thoughtful, one of the good guys, and we, and Cole\u2019s new friend, Lennie, a reclusive artist, hear all about how Mel hurt him as the story progresses. \u201cI want nothing more than to support and empower women, but surely that doesn\u2019t mean that I should lie on the floor and let them walk all over me,\u201d he muses. And: \u201cI know, historically, it\u2019s been hard to be a woman but, my God, it\u2019s hard to be a man right now.\u201d We also learn of the two young women who have been walking the coastline as part of a protest about male violence; we see their confrontation with Cole as he tries to keep them safe. Hall is fantastically good at upending expectations and pulling the wool over her readers\u2019 eyes, so I can\u2019t say much more without giving things away \u2013 but this exploration of female rage isn\u2019t what you think it\u2019s going to be. In Ashley Elston\u2019s First Lie Wins (Headline), we are introduced to Evie Porter as she\u2019s meeting new boyfriend Ryan\u2019s circle of friends and being relentlessly quizzed about her life. We quickly learn that this isn\u2019t such a bad idea: Evie isn\u2019t who she seems. She\u2019s engineered her way into Ryan\u2019s life after her boss, the mysterious Mr Smith, makes Ryan her latest target. But then she meets a woman at a party who appears to have taken on Evie\u2019s real identity, and she begins to realise her boss might be playing her. Elston moves the story back and forth in time, allowing us to see how Evie fell into her life of crime, and watch as her past starts to catch up with her. This is twisty and fast-paced, and Evie is an enjoyably skilful operator. The Alaskan wilds are the setting for Marie Vingtras\u2019s compelling Blizzard (Mountain Leopard Press), ably translated from the French by Stephanie Smee. Bess, the nanny, has stepped out into a snowstorm with the young boy in her charge; she lets go of his hand and loses him. \u201cI can\u2019t see a thing. The snow\u2019s whipping up from the ground in swirling gusts and if I look up to the sky, it\u2019s a total white out. The air itself has been leached of colour, as if every shade has faded away, as if the whole world has been diluted in a glass of water.\u201d The few neighbours in this remote location brave the blizzard to help look for him; Vingtras tells each of her short chapters from their various perspectives, slowly revealing the secrets they all hold as the desperate search goes on. Winner of the French Booksellers award, it is a chilling, tense read. \u2022 To order Argylle, One of the Good Guys, First Lie Wins or Blizzard click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com.

But under the supported employment services award 2020, employees with disability working in supported employment are entitled to only 9.5%, or $15 a week, whichever is greater.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Supported employment, or ADEs, are programs in which people with disability work in a segregated environment under supervision. The award covers approximately 20,000 people. ADEs calculate a wage for a person with a disability based on an assessment of their productivity and competencies, or by reference to what is called the special national minimum wage. The last update to the superannuation rate for people with disability specified in the award was on 1 January 2021. The superannuation guarantee has been updated three times since then, at 0.5% each time. Super rates under the guarantee are scheduled to continue increasing for the next two years until they reach 12% in 2025. Guardian Australia has seen evidence that Orana, a major disability employment provider in South Australia with approximately 450 employees in supported employment, has been calculating superannuation for its employees with disabilities at the 9.5% rate based on the specification in the award. Supported employment roles at Orana include gardening and landscaping, customer service, industrial sewing, packing and assembly. Orana has been approached for comment. David Kirner from the Construction, Forestry and Maritime Employees Union in South Australia, said it was an example of how an outdated award was causing problems for people who were already marginalised and vulnerable. Kirner said the likelihood of wage theft increased substantially when the award contained incorrect or outdated information. \u201cThere\u2019s been a royal commission into the rights of people with a disability but you still have a modern award that says you\u2019ll still get 9.5% superannuation when everyone else gets 11% because nobody\u2019s updated it since 2021,\u201d Kirner said. Before 2019, low-income workers with a disability under the supported employment services award received just 3% superannuation, or a minimum of $6 a week. A campaign from the United Workers\u2019 Union resulted in the Fair Work Commission changing the rate to 9.5% \u2013 equivalent to the mainstream guarantee at the time \u2013 or $15 a week. Catherine McAlpine, chief executive of Inclusion Australia, said the incongruity between the award and the national guarantee was the sort of inequity and oversight that people with disability had come to expect. \u201cThere is absolutely no excuse to not pay people with an intellectual disability the same rate of superannuation as every other employee in the country,\u201d McAlpine said. \u201cPeople with intellectual disability are very clear that they are not respected as employees and that lack of respect is reflected in the very poor wages that they are paid.\u201d In the final report of the disability royal commission, handed down in October last year, four of the seven commissioners recommended the phase-out of disability enterprises and elimination of subminimum wages for people with disability by 2034. Inclusion Australia advocated to the commission for a non-segregated employment support system that gave people with disability ordinary award wages, access to all employment services, and a refocusing of disability enterprises. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we make the changes to better wages carefully to make sure that people with really high support needs don\u2019t lose either their existing job or the opportunity to be employed,\u201d McAlpine said.

The first is that they really like reading. The second \u2013 and I can tell you\u2019re already way ahead of me here \u2013 is that they really like the Queen. So it brings me nothing but dismay to inform you that a full 50% of The Queen\u2019s Reading Room listeners are doomed to come away from the endeavour feeling bitterly disappointed. The Queen\u2019s Reading Room is the podcast offshoot of Queen Camilla\u2019s charity-slash-bookclub where she recommends books for her loyal subjects to read (titles thus far have included Frankenstein, Lessons in Chemistry \u2013 and The Year of Eating Dangerously by an obscure young up-and-comer by the name of Tom Parker Bowles). The thought of expanding this pursuit into podcasts seems like a natural one, since hearing the Queen discuss her favourite books at length \u2013 perhaps with people whose backgrounds would help to challenge her interpretations \u2013 would surely be the ideal way to humanise an aloof and out-of-touch monarchy. Well, tough luck. That isn\u2019t what The Queen\u2019s Reading Room is at all. Instead, it is a deeply generic author interview podcast where Camilla sort of pops up at the end to tersely announce that she quite likes Harry Potter but refuses to do the voices, before rapidly retreating in a cloud of cigarette smoke and gin fumes. In other words, this isn\u2019t the sort of thing you\u2019d listen to if you wanted to learn anything about the Queen at all. The first episode belongs to Sir Ian Rankin, who gamely spends 20 minutes answering a number of slightly nondescript questions about his favourite books. The podcast\u2019s weird format means that all the actual questions have been edited out of the audio, which gives the impression that Rankin has been forced to directionlessly free-associate about himself under literal pain of death. He was on the You\u2019re Booked podcast in October with an actual, flesh and blood interviewer, and was infinitely more engaged and charming. The second episode is a little fizzier, by dint of the fact that its subject is Joanna Lumley. Less celebrated an author than Rankin (her published work includes three memoirs, two travel books and a \u201ccelebration of Queen Elizabeth II\u201d), she nevertheless comes across as excitable and conspiratorial, and often addresses the listeners directly during her entertainingly scatty sermons about the joys of reading for pleasure. Lumley is so good, in fact, that you find yourself wanting to stage a republican revolution to install her as the leader, so that she\u2019ll get to do this podcast instead of Camilla. What a waste of a potentially winning premise this is. Had Camilla gone in with both feet, the podcast still could have been a disaster, but at least it would have been an interesting one. Maybe if she could have recorded the opening introduction herself, rather than foisting it off on a lackey, the enterprise would have had a bit of personality. If she\u2019d have gone one better, and fully committed to the genre by doing intermittent blank-eyed sponsored ad reads for vitamin supplements and Amazon Prime Video, I might have been inclined to listen regularly. We\u2019re left with an immensely hollow feeling. There are already enough podcasts in the world, so the last thing we need is one by a woman who can\u2019t even be bothered to show up properly. And it\u2019s not like there was even a high bar to clear here. Before The Queen\u2019s Reading Room, the only member of the royal family putting literary content online was Sarah Ferguson, who liked to dress up and read children\u2019s books on YouTube. Her videos are like something filmed by a hostage to send coded messages to their family, but at least they have some personality.

This week her Eras Tour film became the highest-grossing concert film in box office history, taking the record from Michael Jackson\u2019s 2009 movie This Is It. She was the only artist who placed in the chart of the UK\u2019s Top 10 albums of 2023 with a new album rather than an older one (albeit with a re-recording of her 2014 pop breakthrough 1989). Last year she became the first woman to have four albums in the US Top 10 at the same time, she took the record for the most US No 1 albums by a woman from Barbra Streisand, the Eras tour became the first ever to earn more than $1bn, and in October Swift herself was estimated to have become a billionaire. In November, a US publication hired a dedicated Swift reporter \u2013 though the joke is that everyone in entertainment media pretty much does the same job, given the wild scale of her success. But beyond commerce, Swift, 34, is also an outlier in terms of how she conducts her relationships with her fans and the public. She maintains an unusual level of control in a period when other pop superstars allow themselves to be the subjects of untrammelled interpretation and speculation \u2013 Harry Styles thrives on mystery; Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s PR strategy appears to be never apologise, never explain \u2013 and understand how doing so might satisfy unexpected elements of one\u2019s fanbase, or suggest surprisingly viable commercial paths. Swift rarely gives interviews \u2013 though more on that later \u2013 and her primary public relations strategy involves seeding fairly obvious clues for her fans to work out her next move, allowing them to feel like active participants in her work while almost always leading them to her desired conclusion. Puppet-mastery is a smart approach, especially for a star who tests the limits of overexposure \u2013 allowing her to remain plausibly out of the picture while perpetually in the spotlight and still on her terms. Occasionally, though, the velvet glove comes off and the tightness of the star\u2019s grip on her narrative becomes felt when people draw the \u201cwrong\u201d conclusions. Last week, the New York Times published a 5,000-word comment piece speculating that Swift is secretly gay \u2013 as deduced from various lyrics and costuming choices \u2013 and suggesting that she owes it to queer fans and less privileged musicians to come out. These notions are not news to the Swift hardcore, a significant number of whom identify as \u201cGaylor\u201d conspiracists, certain that she has dated women throughout her life. But fans gleefully cross-referencing lyrics and dates online \u2013 often seeking an affirmative reflection of their own desires \u2013 is one thing. A major global publication writing a prescriptive, even chastising, article seems both trivial and sinister \u2013 a good old-fashioned celebrity outing under the guise of social conscience, and one that unhelpfully essentialises sexuality to a behavioural code. And as a much better NYT comment piece on queerbaiting put it last year: \u201cAs self-serving as some celebrity caginess can be, you can\u2019t build a world in which everyone feels free to self-identify by ordering everyone to self-identify.\u201d Surprisingly, Swift\u2019s usually invisible team \u2013 or \u201ca person close to the situation\u201d, as CNN reported \u2013 hit back. \u201cBecause of her massive success, in this moment there is a Taylor-shaped hole in people\u2019s ethics,\u201d they told CNN. \u201cThis article wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans. There seems to be no boundary some journalists won\u2019t cross when writing about Taylor, regardless of how invasive, untrue and inappropriate it is \u2013 all under the protective veil of an \u2018opinion piece\u2019.\u201d The response felt almost as heavy-handed and misguided as the original piece. Male artists including Shawn Mendes and Harry Styles have in fact been the subjects of massive speculation about their sexualities: the NYT writer previously published a similar piece about Styles, while Mendes has spoken of the pressure of the constant discourse about his identity. (\u201cI thought, \u2018You fucking guys are so lucky I\u2019m not actually gay and terrified of coming out,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told Rolling Stone. \u201cThat\u2019s something that kills people.\u201d) And there is no way that gimlet-eyed Swift has made the many references listed by accident: if you lead a horse to water, don\u2019t be surprised when it drinks. Dignifying an overblown essay with such a severe response may in turn act as a rebuke to fans who have found identification and solace \u2013 or even just benign entertainment \u2013 in imagining, say, that Swift\u2019s gaspingly sexy Reputation song Dress may be about her once-prominent friend, the model Karlie Kloss (\u201cI don\u2019t want you like a best friend\u201d!), rather than its more likely subject, her then-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. More than ever, pop stardom is an act of collective imagination. Swift may be one of the last monocultural stars \u2013 meaning your grandparents may have a passing awareness of who she is; her moves make tabloid headlines, not just niche gossip items, and prompt bland (but hardly offensive) jokes at awards ceremonies \u2013 but that monoculture is still a federation of distinct fanbases, each with their own interpretation of her. Thanks to social media, members of each of these Swiftian sub-tribes can find each other and imagine and inhabit their own version of her reality, forming community (if sometimes descending into entitlement). The Swift I enjoy is a little vindictive and surprisingly self-lacerating; others may value her loyalty to her friends, her honesty about her experiences with disordered eating, her goofiness, her assiduous capitalist instincts, or may have found in her some other prism through which to understand and appreciate some aspect of their identity \u2013 all of them valid parasocial relationships. Arguably, what Swift serves up is a constructed fiction with herself as the central character: why shouldn\u2019t it compete with others? It\u2019s these playful and personal mutations that keep a star like Swift interesting at a time when her carefully managed media omnipresence and tightly plotted breadcrumb trails have started to feel a little tedious, laden with thudding predictability. (Does the snake-green dress she wore to the Golden Globes at the weekend mean that the serpent-referencing Reputation (Taylor\u2019s Version) is coming? Is the pope Catholic?) For many onlookers, that wearying feeling struck again when reading her lone recent interview, for Time\u2019s person of the year cover, which seemed disappointingly uninquiring and intent on validating her version of events \u2013 namely that she was \u201ccancelled\u201d in the wake of her feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, when in fact it resulted in one of the most successful albums of her career \u2013 rather than pushing deeper into the fertile ground where her self-conception rubs up against public interpretation. The most abiding images of Swift this past year show pop\u2019s biggest outlier standing alone on stage at the Eras tour, bedazzled with sequins.

That\u2019s the case with this Chicago quartet, who arrive boasting Second City credentials, a founding role (alongside Amy Poehler) in the Upright Citizens Brigade, and TV credits including Veep, SNL and The Good Place. Their improvising touch is sure, then \u2013 even if the format isn\u2019t. They\u2019re here to \u201cbring long-form improv to the UK\u201d, they tell us, but what follows is suspended somewhere between sketch comedy and long-form as usually understood.

They take themes and ideas from the audience, riff on them with recurring characters in loosely connected scenes \u2013 then reboot the process and start again.

The quality of the performances, the vividness of the characters, the smoothness of the repartee \u2013 it\u2019s all so delectable, I still found myself chuckling from start to finish. Tonight, we get a hapless barfly beaten up for his views on the climate crisis, a motorist cruising a posh party seeking sponsors for his purchase of a Bentley, and a ghostly grandpa hijacking a house sale. That spectral visitation (played by first-among-equals Brad Morris) is greeted nonchalantly by the other performers on stage, which feels like a misstep. These grizzled veterans tend towards the sardonic, and, in improv terms, that can sometimes feel like blocking or lowering the stakes. There\u2019s a special guest each night, too, which, for all that Rich Fulcher\u2019s contribution was amusing enough, feels like a gimmicky add-on.

But Kathleen Murray is the proud winner of the first World\u2019s Ugliest Lawn competition after the Swedish contest to encourage water-saving, environmentally-friendly gardening went global. Murray\u2019s lawn in Sandford, Tasmania, beat competition from parched grass patches in Germany, France, Canada, Croatia, Sweden, the US and the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty shock-and-awe,\u201d said Murray of her lawn. \u201cThe bandicoots love digging \u2013 that\u2019s how they find their favourite food. Now my back yard looks like a real-life Hungry Hungry Hippo game. I also have an echidna that helps, and some chooks.\u201d Murray lives in an area without mains water, and so rainwater collected in tanks is too precious to waste on the lawn. If she and her four teenage children run out of water in summer, it can be a two-week wait before more water is delivered via tanker. \u201cI used to think the bandicoots were wildlife of mass destruction invading my lawn, but now I see that they\u2019ve actually liberated me from ever having to mow it again,\u201d said Murray, who is the proud owner of the inaugural trophy \u2013 a commemorative T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019m all for guilt-free weekends, especially since my ex-husband left with the lawnmower back in 2016.\u201d The competition began in Gotland, Sweden, two years ago, after the popular holiday island came within hours of running out of water the previous summer. The contest, devised by the municipality of Gotland, became global news after the Guardian picked up the story. Water consumption in Gotland has fallen by 5% thanks to the competition and other measures. Mimmi Gibson of the municipality said: \u201cIt\u2019s a gentle way to nudge people into action and it automatically turns you into a climate hero by not doing anything. We need to start the conversation on how to save water. It\u2019s a global problem. Sometimes, there\u2019s pressure on people to keep their lawn really green and tidy and lush and it can be easier to say \u2018I\u2019m in this competition, I don\u2019t need to water my lawn.\u2019\u201d Murray previously shrugged off criticism of her lawn by calling it \u201ca paddock\u201d, or claiming she\u2019s waiting for the grass to grow so she can cut hay, but is now happy to talk about the biodiversity benefits of her laid-back gardening style. Blue-tongue lizards, kangaroos, wallabies and pademelons all visit from the neighbouring nature reserve. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to make my place an extension of the nature reserve because it is right beside it. That\u2019s another excuse for me not watering my lawn. Do you water Cradle Mountain? No. It just looks after itself. By and large, that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\u201d The jury took nearly two hours of deliberations to reach their verdict on the ugliest lawn. \u201cAll of them were hideous and well worthy of winning but the winning entry was really, really bad,\u201d said Gibson. Diarmuid Gavin, the garden designer and broadcaster who was also a member of the jury, said it was the weirdest competition he had been asked to judge but he hoped it would encourage people to ditch old attachments to green lawns and create climate-appropriate gardens. \u201cSeeing a lawn in Tasmania like this, wondering why there\u2019s a prize for the world\u2019s worst lawn, really makes people think but with that sense of humour, without lecturing or hectoring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Tasmanian garden was soulful because it had an understanding of what\u2019s happening. If we\u2019re lucky enough to look after a piece of land, we all need to be thinking gardeners now. The moral imperative isn\u2019t so much to fit in, or not let the neighbourhood down, it\u2019s to not let the planet down.\u201d Murray added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a choice to make \u2013 do you want farmers to have enough water to produce food for a growing human population or do you want to play some type of lawn nazi competition with your neighbours to make them jealous of how green your lawn is?\u201d \u201cIt brings me a lot of joy to see all the little creatures who now feel safe to come out during the day in my back yard \u2013 they\u2019ve got camouflage, they have happy digging areas.

Do you have any wild stories from the 90s involving Oasis or other Creation Records\u2019 bands? RobJ1982 Plenty of wild stories! We were in an incredible situation, where we grew up listening to records on Creation as teenagers and then got signed by the label. I pinched myself many times. Oasis took us on tour and were generally really warm and generous to us. We had front row seats for some of the madness. When we played the Etihad Stadium with them, they generously gave us the Manchester City home dressing room. One of our guitar techs who supports a rival team claimed to have left tiny messages for the City players all over it \u2013 the lockers, the showers, everything. I can only imagine the scenes when they came face to face with all these sarky comments. What happened to the tank? qwertychucha They were confiscating sound systems after the criminal justice bill [became law], so we put ours in a tank. Tanks are illegal on highways, so we had to pull in favours to park it in fields. When we took it to the [1996] Reading festival on a lorry, we got all these complaints, because it was louder than the second stage. In the end, we sold it to Don Henley from the Eagles, who collects military vehicles. He had no interest in the band and I think had the SFA logo repainted in military colours. We were hoping to have a festival on an aircraft carrier and such, but to do that we needed a platinum\u2011selling album. We met backstage at Victorious festival in 2015. Now that we are best mates, can I use my influence to persuade you and the Super Furry Animals boys to record a 10th album? Maff78 It\u2019s a decimal culture, but through no planning we only managed nine, which seems to be a friendly number for the 21st century. They fit really well on a Rubik\u2019s Cube. I\u2019d never say never, but there are no plans. We last reunited for a tour for the reissue of Mwng [in 2015], which was very enjoyable, but if you let it get out of hand you end up reliving the past in real time, which would be a very strange existence. Eight years ago, you wrote a song about Brexit [I Love EU]. How have you found the time since? Hussar It was a yes-or-no referendum and the outcomes we\u2019re seeing now were all predicted. My sense was that the parameters for Brexit were all going to be set by the right wing. Although I\u2019ve got a lot of time for leftwing arguments about leaving the EU, travelling around Europe was a nightmare before the Maastricht treaty and we\u2019re back to that. I like Noam Chomsky\u2019s take that both in and out are pretty bad situations, but if you\u2019re offered two evils then you go for the lesser one every time. The excellent song Bad Friend on your new album, Sadness Sets Me Free, refers to a caravan holiday on the western edge of Wales, where \u201cit was raining, the beer was warm and the chips were wet\u201d. Is the lyric based on real experience? VerulamiumParkRanger Every holiday I\u2019ve had, more or less. But the song is about how you can only take a caravan-load with you, or if you\u2019ve got a five-a-side football team only five can play. It\u2019s about the pressure of not being able to be there for everyone everywhere all the time. I wrote the song in 2022, but only learned the word \u201ccapacity\u201d in 2023, which would have explained it much more simply. Could there ever be a Euros Childs/Gruff Rhys collaboration? And do you agree he is one of the greats from the Welsh music scene? Peeby7 I agree, he\u2019s one of the greats. I first heard Gorky\u2019s Zygotic Mynci on Welsh language radio in 1990. We\u2019ve played gigs together over the years, then about two years ago I was in a supergroup with Euros on Welsh language TV. We ended up jamming with the Welsh band Adwaith for 30 minutes, but it was never recorded. It\u2019s probably still echoing in space. Your Edinburgh fringe show a few years ago demonstrated an incredible talent for deadpan comedy. Is that an experience you\u2019d like to revisit? DefinitelyStillAlive I did a slideshow tour for the album American Interior and got offered a week of gigs in Edinburgh. I\u2019ve got no interest in comedy, really. It was harrowing; all the posters with comedians staring out of them were really scary. They\u2019re all there for a month. I felt really bad for them. It\u2019s brutal. I enjoyed playing in one place, sometimes twice a day, but they didn\u2019t ask me back. Having written Neon Neon\u2019s Stainless Style album in honour of the DeLorean, which of the vehicle\u2019s most famous drivers are you more like: Marty McFly (resourceful, family-oriented, success-driven) or Dr Emmett Brown (dreamer, creative, a sponge for new experiences)? McScootikins Emmett Brown sounds like a more interesting place to be, but I think maybe I\u2019m just the car itself, just the vehicle for the songs. The wild thing about songwriting is that it makes things happen. We did gigs with all these DeLoreans parked outside, people giving us lifts in them, even DeLoreans racing down Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. Do you remember the SFA gig at Somerset House? You played a DJ set at Corsica Studios afterwards. There were face masks of Dickie Davies on the ceiling. ginger-nick I think it was my 38th birthday [it was his 39th]. I\u2019ve got no memory of Dickie Davies face masks, but Andy Votel played the DJ set. It was so loud that it blew my friend\u2019s ears. He\u2019s still got tinnitus, 15 years later. What was it like recording Superfast Jellyfish for Gorillaz? Are the rumours true that you secretly appear on more tracks? FurryVision8000 Damon Albarn had the bassline and he got me and a drummer to jam with him until he felt there was something happening. The next time I heard it, De La Soul were rapping on it. I\u2019d bought their records as a teenager, so it was unbelievable. Then we did gigs where Mick Jones and Paul Simonon from the Clash were the guitarist and bass player and De La Soul were in the band. It was a surreal experience \u2013 incredible, really. Damon recorded a choir for the whole Plastic Beach album and I was in that choir, so I\u2019m probably on a lot of songs. I always regret never buying an SFA-sponsored Cardiff City football shirt from the 1999/00 season. However, with you being a Bangor City fan, why was it Cardiff you sponsored and not your beloved Citizens? Alsithee When I moved from Bangor in north Wales to Cardiff in the south, to make my fortune, or something, with Super Furry Animals \u2013 I\u2019m still trying! \u2013 there was a contingent of Bangor fans who supported Cardiff: the Bangor City Bluebirds. So I didn\u2019t feel conflicted. Bangor were bankrupted and I\u2019m a Cardiff season ticket holder now. In the late 90s, there was this guy who was buying cheap ice hockey shirts from Egypt and convincing football teams that there were football shirts. So the Super Furry Animals Cardiff City shirt was actually an ice hockey shirt. We could only afford to sponsor them for the Welsh Cup. The chairman made a speech about the \u201cfive-figure deal\u201d, but in reality it only cost us \u00a32,000. Mwng is my favourite SFA album, despite me not understanding Welsh. Does singing in Welsh makes your songwriting easier? Flash bleu It\u2019s my first language, but my favourite melodies are the ones that come with words attached, so if they come in either language I won\u2019t change them. I\u2019m surprised I\u2019ve made so many English-language albums, but I\u2019ll always do Welsh-language ones. People ask me if I dream in Welsh and I\u2019m like: \u201cI don\u2019t think language is anywhere near my dreams. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in them!\u201d Would you represent the UK at the 2025 Eurovision song contest? VerulamiumParkRanger I\u2019d maybe do it for an independent Wales, although music is meant to transcend borders.

It was Prime Video\u2019s No 1 film over Christmas, featured song Murder on the Dancefloor is back in the charts, and TikTok appears to have gone beserk. Saltburn\u2019s route to this is relatively unorthodox. A glamorous, Brideshead-style period film, with an Oscar-winning writer-director in the chair and a name-droppable cast including Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike and Jacob Elordi, Saltburn\u2019s entry into the world was relatively gentle. Far from an effects-laden blockbuster with proven audience-attractors, a film like this would aim to be hosed down with admiring reviews, and find itself positioned for a significant awards run. In the event, reviews were far from unanimous, particularly in the UK: the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called it \u201cwatchable but sometimes weirdly overheated and grandiose\u201d, while the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Robbie Collin applauded its \u201csheer, nude-bungee-jumping-level fearlessness\u201d. Saltburn was swiftly labelled the \u201cmost divisive film of the year\u201d. A high-profile festival run, including a world premiere at the Telluride festival (which has previously acted as a launchpad for 12 Years a Slave, Moonlight and Belfast), led to a modest initial cinema release, never reaching higher than No 8 in the North American box office chart, and currently standing at a respectable $20.6m in worldwide takings. One statistic, however, may be a pointer to things to come: its box office takings held up remarkably well in its third week, declining by 9.3%, an impressive result in an environment where films normally drop high double-digits each week. Word of mouth, in retrospect, must have been strong. And, in the digital age, that is no longer an invisible weapon. Saltburn\u2019s powerful online game \u2013 crossing TikTok, Spotify, Letterboxd and all points in between \u2013 appears to be a juggernaut, with Deadline reporting that Saltburn-related videos have recorded 4bn views on TikTok alone. Writer-director Emerald Fennell\u2019s eye for viral moments \u2013 the bath, the grave, the dance \u2013 would appear to mesh fully with this non-traditional method of getting eyeballs on her film. Saltburn isn\u2019t yet achieving the same awards-related critical mass as Fennell\u2019s debut, Promising Young Woman. It missed out entirely at the Screen Actors Guild awards and scored only two nominations at the Golden Globes. Yet momentum can gather and awards season can swing. Saltburn may be the latest example of the critic-proof movie, though far from the one that depends on an action-star or comic-book fanbase to rack up the revenue. Saltburn has come from the opposite direction: an awards movie that has compensated for any brickbats with a flattering ability to pique a digital-oriented audience.

A raw and gritty novel of gay love, grief and resilience, it focused on Joe Gunner, a working-class young man stalked by visions, revenants and enemies. The narrative flitted between past and present, cut with periodic interludes where a river speaks to Joe, sometimes teasingly, sometimes pugnaciously. The novel swarmed with enigmas but eschewed easy answers: \u201cWay we put meaning on the things that happen to us \u2026 We make shit up \u2013 to make sense of it.\u201d Ransom has now written a hypnotic and even more mysterious second novel, The Gallopers. This is a lust-drenched, ache-filled gay love triangle of sorts that gnarls into a sly emotional thriller. The action begins in 1953 Norfolk, shortly after the North Sea flood. The narrator is 19-year-old Eli Stone, whose mother, Eliza, is believed to have been washed away. Eli lives with his aunt Dreama next to a cursed piece of land that exerts an uncanny force on them, and keeps the townspeople at a superstitious distance. When the flood came, \u201cwater rushed across the county displacing everything\u201d, save their field. Eli is enthralled with Jimmy Smart, the handsome and obliging fairground worker who rooms up at their barn. One night, not long after they first meet, Eli finds himself masturbating to the sight of the man washing himself off in the open. One of the central themes in The Gallopers is the occult machinery of desire: its blinding intensity and crippling sway on the mind and the body. \u201cDesire is cunning like that,\u201d Eli repeatedly thinks. Being in the company of Jimmy, Eli tells us, \u201cinterferes with everything, like the hairs on my arm during a thunderstorm\u201d. Ransom orchestrates some truly ravishing moments between the two men, tableaux roiling with heat, tenderness and poetry. Jimmy and Eli swim in the nude at night, soap each other\u2019s backs, share cigarettes in wordless pleasure. They dance by a bonfire, Jimmy \u201ccommuning with the flames\u201d, \u201chis gaze more mysterious beneath the moonlight. As though he might tip his head and howl.\u201d The other man in Eli\u2019s life is Shane Wright, his co-worker at a print shop. A gruff, boorish figure \u201cfilled up with tragedy\u201d, Shane dreams of going to America where he hopes to make a career in fitness modeling. Sex and a whiff of scandal tie him and Eli in an uneasy partnership, and later, when a girl from their neighbourhood goes missing and trouble comes sniffing for Shane, he calls on Eli for help. The Gallopers is a whispered howl of a novel about men fettered by masculine norms, the ideas and pressures that curtail their freedom, and the bargains they strike with others and themselves in order to live. The novel is excellent on queer love and the shape it takes once it mixes with shame, blood and guilt. Some of its best and most poignant passages capture the ghoulish discord between queerness and the law, the individual and the world, truth and deceit. As in Ransom\u2019s debut, homophobia and misogyny are the twin evils. Eli is bullied and chastised for his effeminacy; he longs, as a result, to flee, to rid himself of his \u201csissy mouth\u201d. Throughout the book, a steady volley of stones flies through the windows of Eli\u2019s room, collecting at the foot of his bed: grim tokens, he believes, of the townspeople\u2019s disapproval. Women similarly suffer the casual violence of men. They are \u201cdisappeared\u201d and later found traumatised, defiled or rotting deep in the ground. At the centre of the story lies a one-act play titled The Gallopers. Written by Eli three decades on and presented as a playscript, it reprises the themes of the novel at a slanted angle, recasting Eliza, Dreama and Shane in new roles. Shane appears as a version of Eli, grappling with his queerness, ready to take flight. Dreama, here Shane\u2019s mother, is seen fretting over a misplaced photo album, while Eliza, who is dying of Aids, digs for an unexploded second world war bomb in the field outside their house. Jimmy is a silent character; a showman invoked a few times by name and the fairground music that is part of the stage directions. Does the play hold the keys to the novel? Does it bring nuance, or add to our reading of the rest of the book? I\u2019m unsure. The novel proper ends in 1954, with Eli leaving for national service. What the play might mean, beyond an older Eli\u2019s attempt to fictionalise his life, while wrestling with ideas of loss, sickness and mortality, is up to the reader to decide. But at its best, The Gallopers offers a surprising and quietly devastating account of three men, and their troubled relationship with themselves and the world they live in. \u2022 The Gallopers by Jon Ransom is published by Muswell Press (\u00a314.99).

The 24-hour news cycle is still wiping the sleep from its eyes but the world continues to deliver amazing stories: I can\u2019t get enough of the world\u2019s oldest cat and the world\u2019s tidiest mouse. The great reads are also flowing freely. If you haven\u2019t had your first coffee of the weekend yet, maybe take a sip below first for some inspiration. 1. The miracle of coffee The journey of coffee from plant to cup is so complex its discovery surely ranks alongside humanity\u2019s greatest achievements. Bianca Nogrady investigates the \u201csimultaneously fascinating and illuminating\u201d hard science behind the brewed concoction \u2013 and convinces an expert barista to share her secrets. Bean me up: A study published last month likened the physics of coffee grinding to what takes place on a moon of Saturn. How long will it take to read: Four minutes.

On the fifth day, her maternity support worker assured her it would get easier. So she pushed through, until at six weeks she was diagnosed with thrush. Sirin\u2019s story has a happy ending, but the debate continues: is breastfeeding or formula milk best? And why is a new mother\u2019s mental health not top priority? Sirin\u2019s breastfeeding advice: \u201cIt is absolutely fine to stop, or never start.\u201d How long will it take to read: Six minutes. 3. The effortlessly awesome Willem Dafoe He\u2019s played Jesus Christ and a memorable Spider-Man villain, plus added his dependable brand of gravitas to low-budget Australian films (Daybreakers and The Hunter). Willem Dafoe is also a hell of an interview subject, as Rebecca Nelson learned while the US actor was on the promotional trail for Poor Things. \u201cWith sheep and goats, some you know well, some have names and they really stick, but some are just sheep and goats. But every alpaca, you have a whole particular relationship with, and you know their character.\u201d \u2013 Willem Dafoe, hobby farmer and animal whisperer.

The story of how the Fairfax Media archive \u2013 featuring photos from Sir Edmund Hillary at the summit of Mount Everest to the 1969 W\u0101hine ferry disaster \u2013 found its way into his possession is as incredible as the images. Why is there no photo preview? The pics in this collection are so special we only have permission to use them once. What are you waiting for? How long will it take to read: Two minutes. 5. Why the cost-of-living crisis isn\u2019t about the price of groceries \u201cCossie livs\u201d is already front and centre of the Australian political discourse in 2024, with inflation falling further than expected (good) and supermarkets accused of price gouging (bad). Not that the latter is necessarily the root cause of the crisis. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the cost of buying goods, but whether our income is sufficient to pay for those goods,\u201d the economist John Quiggin writes.

Well, I am sure still breathing; the pain all over my body is a sign that it is functioning. What does \u201calive\u201d mean? Is everything we are going through called life. I wonder about the difference between me and a dead person. Does the loss of safety and your hopes and dreams qualify you to be dead? Because if so, this means that Gaza has became a city of ghosts. Is it a life when you are helpless all the time, unable to even provide your loved ones with their basic needs? In a phone call with my friend, who I have been trying to reach for the past three months (wow! I cannot imagine it has been three months), she tells me that she and her family are still alive. \u201cMy children always ask me for their favourite food and toys,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI had to take them to the empty shops to show them that there is nothing left. I wanted badly to make them believe that I would sacrifice my whole life for a moment of safety and joy they could have, but there is nothing I can do.\u201d She tells me how, when she took her children out, she was holding them tightly to keep them safe and not lose them in the crowd. She talks about the huge numbers of people everywhere you go, and how the streets are packed. I share with her that a couple of weeks ago I saw a lost little girl who was crying. She couldn\u2019t see her family and hundreds of people were moving in all directions. I stood next to her and did not know what to do. I asked around if anyone knew her, but no one did. About 10 minutes later, a big man approached, he was almost taller than everyone in the street, and he had broad shoulders. He picked the girl up and put her over his shoulders and he kept turning around in a circle until her sister, a teenager, who was at the end of the street, saw and came running towards us. He put the girl down and she hugged her sister. 10am I go to check on my friend and I got the chance to meet the family that hosted him. They have the most adorable little girl. She is sociable and has a beautiful smile. The family tells me that she hasn\u2019t gone out of the house for almost three months. The little girl tells me about her friend and how much she loves her. It turns out \u201cher friend\u201d is actually a lady who lives in the building nearby. They never spoke together, but when the lady goes to put out the laundry, the girl puts her head out of the window and waves at her, the lady would smile back. \u201cSo, do you have any other friends?\u201d I ask. She says the lady is her only friend. \u201cI love her.\u201d Later on, I met \u201ca friend\u201d of mine. I have never met the man before, but it turned out that he used to work in the kitchen of one of my favourite restaurants. I was so glad to see him; he, somehow, was a connection to a life I no longer have. He tells me that he helped with preparing all the dishes and sweets, but his main task was the salads. He and everyone around start talking about the situation: what to expect, the fear of the unknown future. I say: \u201cCan we please speak about something else, something positive?\u201d \u201cLike what?\u201d he asks. \u201cLike salads,\u201d I say. He laughs. I ask, \u201cSo tell me, what was the most popular salad? I used to order Greek salad or caesar salad every time I had lunch at the restaurant. Also, you had the best molten cake in Gaza. I used to come especially to order it.\u201d I ask him if he cooks at his house, because I hear that chefs never do that after a long day of cooking. He says he cooks for his wife only. When they invited people over, they ordered takeaway. He shares many stories about the restaurant, and on his way out, he says he hopes we meet again. I tell him I will meet him one day in the restaurant and try one of his delicious salads. 1pm It is time to take little Hope, the cat we rescued and found a new place for him to stay, to his new home. My sister gives me a big bag that has wet food, dry food, his medicine and some cheese. He likes cheese. She also put the only two toys she got from our home. They belonged to our cats, they are in the shape of a reindeer and Santa Claus. She said he needs them more than our cats. I put him in the bag and get ready to go out when she stops me. She takes him out and asks him for forgiveness and promises him that if he and we make it out alive, she will visit. 6pm I receive a message from the guy who took Hope. He tells me that he is doing very well, and he sends me two photos. The photos take around two hours to open, but it was totally worth it. In one of them he was sleeping in his lap, and in the other he was chasing a ball. I am grateful we found this angel to take care of him. 10pm I have always been impressed by those who are eloquent with words; who have the capacity to express their inner thoughts precisely. I recall a message between me and a friend who lives abroad, I told her that the situation is getting worse. In her response she put the word \u201cgetting\u201d into brackets. I understood what she meant, for three months the situation has been awful. But what English word to use after bad? Worse? Worst? There are no stronger words to show the situation continues to deteriorate. Just when you think that you hit the rock bottom, you realise you were wrong. There is always a new low. Whether it is dignity-wise, basic needs-wise or just living. I miss a life where I would sleep on a bed, go to work, drink clean water, eat something I like of my own choice, meet friends and go back to the same bed and watch something online or read a book. I miss a life where mothers can walk in the streets and let their children run in front of them, enjoying the fresh air and, later, enjoy delicious foods and sweets. I miss a life where children have other children around, to play with, become friends, and start creating beautiful memories for their future. That life seems very distant and unrealistic.

Family. Most awkward moment? I didn\u2019t drink any alcohol or eat a full meal. I\u2019d had a very late breakfast and I\u2019m in training \u2013 so perhaps that mismatch was a bit awkward. Good table manners? Yes, can\u2019t complain. Best thing about Eleanor? She has a great relationship with her family and friends, which is amazing. Would you introduce Eleanor to your friends? Yes. She is a funny person with a great personality. Describe Eleanor in three words. Open-minded, family-oriented, positive. What do you think Eleanor made of you? I hope she enjoyed the evening. We had very similar taste in horror films. Did you go on somewhere? No. And \u2026 did you kiss? The conversation flowed effortlessly, but it didn\u2019t feel charged with romantic potential.

Most awkward moment? Me dining solo. He wasn\u2019t hungry because he\u2019d had breakfast at 3pm! Good table manners? He didn\u2019t eat much or drink anything, so I\u2019m unsure about his table manners. Best thing about Jayson? We didn\u2019t stop talking. He was full of questions and stories about holidays and experiences running marathons. Would you introduce Jayson to your friends? Yes, although I\u2019m unsure if he would enjoy an evening with them. Describe Jayson in three words. Sweet, serious, polite. What do you think Jayson made of you? I think he found me rather unserious and wild, especially when I had my third solo spicy margarita. Did you go on somewhere? No, it wasn\u2019t really the vibe. And \u2026 did you kiss? No. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? That we could have shared a few small plates and sampled more of the menu. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again?

The athletes all have good old-fashioned Gladiator names \u2013 Athena, Sabre, Apollo, Bionic \u2013 and jog into the foam-finger-and-flashbang-filled arena in perfect 90s-style tracksuits. The Travelator is back, as are the best old games \u2013 Duel! Hang Tough! \u2013 as well as some new twists. Footy commentator Guy Mowbray is on comms. The whole thing absolutely zips along. The contenders are great and bustling with personality \u2013 Britain has spent the last three decades creating an army of cheerful gym rats, and they are ready to show how good they are by running up a hill that is trying to run against them. But wow, watching it is like being transported back in time: I feel as if I could get a Freddo for 10p, or get suspended from school for bleaching my hair like Gazza, or care about Blur. It\u2019s exhilarating. Our Gladiators, then. Giant is like if they put Ben White on performance-enhancing drugs instead of breastmilk. Electro has palpable \u201cM\u00fcller advert\u201d energy. Nitro is in more boys\u2019 group chats than any other person on Earth. Your parents are going to have an enormous row when your mum finds what your dad was trying to search on the iPad about Comet. Steel looks like he had to choose between this and a third-week exit on The Apprentice, and thankfully he chose to wield the pugil stick. If she was born in a different time, Fury has the vibe of someone chosen fifth to join a Pop Idol-era girlband. Legend is going to go one of two ways: beloved British TV star with a 40-year career, or has his Instagram DMs leaked by a tabloid and has to rebrand as a golf coach. Dynamite was born in 2003. Apollo wants to call you into a meeting room for a quick chat, nothing to worry about, nah you don\u2019t need a union rep. I\u2019m not saying anything about Diamond because she looks as if she could rip a car door off and hit me over the head with it. Primary schools across the country are going to have assemblies telling them all to stop \u201cpretending to be Viper and trying to kick each other in the head\u201d. I can\u2019t believe there are more: Athena (keeps taking Local Legend badges off you on Strava), Phantom (someone is genuinely going to go to prison for a graphic thirst tweet they send about him), Sabre (Scottish), Fire (is one day going to write a million-selling children\u2019s book about the power of sport). Bionic looks the most like he\u2019s from the 90s so he might spiritually be my favourite. All of them are very charming and nice (well, not Viper, but that\u2019s his bit) and magnanimous in defeat or victory. They say positive things to the contenders \u2013 \u201cHope you make it to the quarter-finals!\u201d \u2013 and there\u2019s a wholesome Locker Room Cam where they discuss how difficult each round was. But other than that, it\u2019s basically beat-for-beat the same show as 1992: even the ripping theme tune is intact. If Gladiators has one misstep, it\u2019s the presenting team. I am British and I am human, therefore I love Bradley Walsh on The Chase, but as nepo babies go I find his son Barney a flavourless dupe of his father and, crucially, quite sexless. Gladiators, at its peak, was a heroic arena-based kids\u2019 show that secretly undulated with sexual frisson, and no part of me feels that Barney Walsh is willing to explode his life to have a six-week affair with Sabre. This feels like an opportunity missed. Get AJ Odudu in for series two and we might have the best show in the world on our hands. Put the oven on and the cola in the fridge.

He had attempted a novel before, but \u201cI wasn\u2019t giving it everything, I had too much on. And this was the first time where I thought: No, I\u2019m able to focus on this for a couple of years now.\u201d Osman\u2019s agent, Juliet Mushens, adds: \u201cHe told me he was working on a novel, but he didn\u2019t want to show it to anyone until he finished the whole thing.\u201d When he did, \u201cwe did a couple of drafts and submitted it to publishers\u201d. The rest is history: since The Thursday Murder Club was released, Osman has published three further novels and sold more than 10m books worldwide. He is the most successful example of a phenomenon that is more prominent than ever: the celebrity novelist. Of course, famous people have written novels for decades \u2013 from Alan Titchmarsh to Ben Elton. And the children\u2019s market has become saturated with celebrities, including David Walliams, Geri Halliwell-Horner, Paul McCartney and Jamie Oliver. But sales of adult fiction by celebrities have remained relatively low, until recently. According to Nielsen BookScan data, in 2018 the Top 100 paperback fiction bestsellers contained just one title by a celebrity author \u2013 Uncommon Type by Tom Hanks \u2013 with none in the Top 20. In 2023, the picture changed dramatically: eight of the top 100 bestselling paperback fiction books, and five of the top 20, were by celebrities \u2013 including books by Bob Mortimer, Richard Coles and Dolly Parton. Osman\u2019s exceptional success has seen an army of celebrity novelists follow in his wake. Opinion is divided on the phenomenon: some argue that a rising tide lifts all ships, so increased sales of novels by celebrities attracts readers to other books, too. Others believe that celebrity novels steal the oxygen of publicity from writers who don\u2019t have another career to fall back on. I spoke to publishers, agents and writers \u2013 celebrity and otherwise \u2013 to find out more about the growth of this very modern trend, and where it might go next. The first point of dispute is whether we should use the label \u201ccelebrity novelist\u201d at all. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a pejorative,\u201d says literary agent Jonny Geller of Curtis Brown, suggesting, he says, that \u201cthey\u2019re not serious writers, it\u2019s a bit of merchandise. They have a line of shoes, they have a podcast, and they have a book out.\u201d Broadcaster and journalist Lorraine Kelly, whose debut novel will be published in February, agrees. \u201cI\u2019d rather just \u2018novelist\u2019, to be honest.\u201d Non-celebrity novelist Stephanie Merritt, who writes as SJ Parris, dislikes hearing it for different reasons. \u201cMy heart sinks. I\u2019m not alone in feeling a degree of resentment at the investment that gets made into famous names.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something I find a bit frustrating,\u201d says Mushens, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think anyone would describe Stephen Fry as a celebrity novelist, would they?\u201d That is probably true, even though Fry was an actor and comedian before publishing his debut novel, The Liar, in 1991. Many of today\u2019s celebrity novelists were writers of another kind before turning to fiction. Bob Mortimer and Dawn French are comedians, and Osman was a writer and script editor for TV. Osman says that for people like these, \u201cit would be surprising if they didn\u2019t write books. If you write and you read, there comes a point where you have to write a book, otherwise something else is going to erupt out of you.\u201d Geller agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s got to be an obsession.\u201d But not all celebrity novelists are known for writing, nor do they always have books erupting from them. \u201cThe way the industry works is that we jump on bandwagons,\u201d says Phoebe Morgan, publishing director for commercial fiction at Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who publishes Graham Norton and Sara Cox. \u201cIf you get someone like Osman breaking out, everybody else tries to replicate that kind of success.\u201d This is not surprising: publishing is competing with other forms of entertainment in an increasingly fragmented media landscape, and an author with existing name recognition is a tempting prospect. The rise of TikTok as a book promotion tool means, says Geller, that publishers \u201ccan actually look at which people are trending, what themes people are reading, and can monetise that\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no question,\u201d adds Geller, \u201cthat publishers are looking for people with platforms; they\u2019re bringing a ready-made audience.\u201d His agency, Curtis Brown, \u201chas a big talent and presenters department, [and] we\u2019d get emails every week saying, \u2018Would so-and-so write a novel?\u2019\u201d Morgan confirms that it usually happens this way around: publishers approach celebrities. (Osman, who wrote his book before approaching an agent, seems to be an outlier.) But they\u2019re not looking for just any celebrity. \u201cThey like the idea of national treasures,\u201d Geller says, \u201cbecause people identify with them.\u201d One who surely fits this mould is Lorraine Kelly. \u201cYes, we were approached,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I was so excited about the fact that it was Maeve [Binchy]\u2019s publisher!\u201d Kelly\u2019s novel, The Island Swimmer, set in Orkney, is described by her publisher, Orion, as \u201can emotional novel about community, grief, connection and hope\u201d. Once the deal was agreed, however, \u201cthey left me to it\u201d. Kelly had to \u201ccarve out chunks of time\u201d to write her book, because \u201cwriting is a full-time job, and I already have a full-time job\u201d. But there is another kind of celebrity novel that is different from those by Osman or Kelly or others mentioned above: the ghostwritten novel, where a famous name, who may contribute ideas for a story or character or other elements, will work with a professional writer who does most, or all, of the actual writing. As Merritt says, \u201cpublishers are chasing after basically anybody who\u2019s been on the telly, whether or not they have the ability to write a novel.\u201d For Osman this is \u201can entirely different industry: people who are famous for different things, ghostwriting a book and putting that out.\u201d As he says, \u201cOf course the publisher will publish, because there\u2019s not really a downside.\u201d These ghostwritten celebrity novels also have a lineage: Naomi Campbell\u2019s Swan (1995), for example, was written by Caroline Upcher with almost no input from Campbell. The modern version tends to be more collaborative, drawing on the celebrity\u2019s knowledge of their industry, like Shirley Ballas\u2019s Murder on the Dance Floor \u2013 a cosy crime novel set in the world of ballroom dancing, which was written with Sheila McClure, an author of more than 30 novels. \u201cWhat publishers are looking for is clarity,\u201d says Geller. \u201cIf someone is famous for something, the novel should reflect that. If a celebrity on Gogglebox wants to write an adaptation of Medea, that\u2019s quite a challenge for a publisher.\u201d It seems that a key factor here is openness. \u201cMost people who don\u2019t write their own novel are open about it,\u201d says Osman. \u201cAnd that, to me, is not a con, because you know what you\u2019re getting. It\u2019s a brand thing.\u201d A recent example is Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s Nineteen Steps. Brown, an actor best known for Stranger Things, worked with ghostwriter Kathleen McGurl. But for her editor, Katie Seaman, who now runs her own editorial consultancy, Brown\u2019s personal connection to the book was crucial. \u201cWhat attracted me was that it felt authentic,\u201d says Seaman. \u201cThe fact that it was inspired by her family history \u2013 she was very close to her nan, who lived in Bethnal Green during the war.\u201d Brown\u2019s novel is in part about the Bethnal Green tube disaster, where 173 people were killed in March 1943. \u201cIn terms of a government cover-up, and the way it was portrayed by media, it felt timely,\u201d adds Seaman. McGurl is named on the title page (though not the cover), and Brown was open about the book being ghost-written, posting a photo with McGurl for her 63 million Instagram followers. But Brown attracted criticism nonetheless. \u201cGhostwritten celebrity novels have ruined children\u2019s fiction and now they\u2019re doing the same thing to adult fiction,\u201d wrote one user on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cPublishing is always a collaboration,\u201d says Seaman. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve edited a book, it\u2019s always felt like a partnership. If people are making an argument for a ghostwriter to be on the cover, where do you draw the line? Because often an editor could have a really heavy hand in shaping a manuscript.\u201d This is true: Raymond Carver\u2019s stories were cut to pieces by editor Gordon Lish to create the minimalist voice for which Carver then became celebrated. Why did Brown\u2019s novel receive so much opprobrium? \u201cIt did feel like some of the things that were levelled at her were ageist and misogynistic,\u201d says Seaman. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a different standard that young women are held to.\u201d What about the shadowy third category: the novels suspected to be ghostwritten but not declared as such? For Osman, \u201cThe contract you have with readers is that \u2026 at least [the author] has gone to extreme lengths to write something that represents them. That\u2019s the heart of all literature, whether commercial or literary. And if somebody doesn\u2019t do that, it just feels like a kick in the teeth.\u201d Lorraine Kelly agrees: \u201cAs long as you make it clear you\u2019re working with someone \u2026 because that\u2019s not fair if whoever\u2019s done all the work doesn\u2019t get the recognition.\u201d Sometimes there are suggestions a celebrity may have had help. In his novel Deadly Game, Michael Caine thanks journalist Matthew d\u2019Ancona for \u201chelping me put it together\u201d. Rob Rinder\u2019s novel The Trial acknowledges journalist Emily Fairbairn \u201cfor weed-whacking through my cerebral detritus to find an intelligible story\u201d. Neither novel credits a ghostwriter. (Rinder\u2019s publisher declined to speak to me for this piece.) Some may feel any ghostwritten book is intrinsically bad: that a novel is \u2013 in Evelyn Waugh\u2019s words \u2013 an exercise in language, and that a writer cannot convey an authentic vision of the world using someone else\u2019s words. But not all readers agree. \u201cSome people might be intimidated by a very literary novel,\u201d says Phoebe Morgan at Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u201cbut they look at celebrity fiction and think: \u2018That\u2019s accessible, because I recognise that person from TV.\u2019\u201d Geller points out that nobody minds about ghostwritten memoirs, but with fiction, \u201ceveryone feels quite precious about it\u201d. Maybe that is part of a larger objection to all celebrity novels, ghostwritten or not. \u201cThey seem to get to the front of the queue,\u201d says Merritt. Furthermore, \u201cyou don\u2019t hear it in other media. Judy Murray\u2019s agent is not saying to her, \u2018Oh Judy, you\u2019ve given birth to a famous tennis player, why don\u2019t you have a show at the Royal Academy?\u2019\u201d It is, says Merritt, \u201ca devaluing of writing as a craft that requires any professional skill\u201d. Crime novelist Ian Rankin says: \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t so successful I might have been pissed off about it. I used to moan to my agent and he said [celebrity novels] get people into a bookshop who have never been in a bookshop in their lives. I\u2019m a lot more sanguine than I used to be, but I can afford to be more sanguine.\u201d Morgan agrees with this analysis. Publishing a successful celebrity author means that \u201cwe might be able to take a risk on a debut author, because we\u2019ve made that money\u201d. Geller, who represents comedian Ruth Jones, acknowledges that \u201cthere\u2019s no question she has an advantage over a debut novelist living in the middle of nowhere\u201d. It is, in other words, easier to get your debut published if you have a public profile. But you cannot sustain four novels this way, as Graham Norton has, or \u2013 like Osman \u2013 enjoy success in countries where you\u2019re not already famous. Passion for doing it is key. Lorraine Kelly talks persuasively about \u201cthe sense of achievement I\u2019ve got, holding [my novel] in my hand\u201d. Osman\u2019s success may explain why other celebrities have followed him into crime, including Rob Rinder and Reverend Richard Coles, but there are notable celebrity hits in romance and comedy, too. Are any celebrities writing literary novels? Morgan suggests it may be that \u201cthe more commercial publishers are the ones that approach a celebrity, whereas more literary imprints don\u2019t do that as much\u201d. For Osman, literary fiction for a celebrity novelist is \u201ca harder nut to crack\u201d. One who tried it was David Baddiel. After two comic novels, his third, The Secret Purposes (2004), was an ambitious literary novel about the internment of British and Jewish-German refugees on the Isle of Man during the second world war. But, he says, there is a \u201cdeep resistance\u201d to celebrity novels in literary culture. \u201cAnd then I wrote The Death of Eli Gold, probably my best novel. And it\u2019s shallow on some level to want these books to be nominated for a prize,\u201d but there is, he says, \u201can unfortunate ecosystem between literary fiction and prize winning. It doesn\u2019t get read, really, unless you get nominated for one of the major prizes.\u201d He attributes this to the fact that \u201cfame is so fragmented now. Here\u2019s your corner of fame. People don\u2019t like it if you\u2019re encroaching on other arenas.\u201d He mentions Magnus Mills, whose debut, The Restraint of Beasts (1998), was shortlisted for the Booker prize while he was a bus driver. \u201cThat was an absolute plus for him. But if he\u2019d been a famous bus driver, if he\u2019d been on a reality show called The Bus Driver, it would not have been a plus for him.\u201d In the end, after Eli Gold, Baddiel \u201cgave up writing literary fiction\u201d, turning instead to highly successful nonfiction and children\u2019s novels. Not all celebrity novels do well, anyway. Remember model Cara Delevingne\u2019s Mirror Mirror (2017)? Me neither. \u201cIf you look at the charts for adult fiction, it isn\u2019t dominated by celebrities at all,\u201d says Juliet Mushens. \u201cThe books that work in the area are genuinely, extremely good.\u201d Osman thinks \u201cthe fiction world is actually unusually healthy for unknown voices. The hugest hits of recent years \u2013 Gabrielle Zevin, Bonnie Garmus \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have happened in film or TV.\u201d And will the bubble pop? Not just yet. Kelly is \u201calready working on my second one\u201d. Osman would \u201clove to do 20 or 30. It\u2019s the thing that most represents who I am.\u201d Morgan confirms she has recently signed two new celebrity novelists \u2013 names withheld, but they fit into Geller\u2019s \u201cnational treasure\u201d category. \u201cI think it\u2019s those personality types that people love and recognise, and also have a good story to tell,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is the best version of celebrity fiction.\u201d But will anyone surpass Richard Osman, whose latest book was the fastest-selling hardback ever by a British author \u2013 beating the record set by his previous novel? Geller has an idea. \u201cThe most popular book that hasn\u2019t happened is Taylor Swift\u2019s novel,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cThat will get every demographic.\u201d Mr Osman \u2013 watch out.", "date": "2024-01-13", "section": "Books", "author": "John Self", "id": 534, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8552caefd6635a18119dee71ee556000d073762f/61_1087_3719_2230/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018Such rare and magnificent beauty in city life\u2019: Himanshu Roy\u2019s best phone picture", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/13/himanshu-roy-best-phone-picture", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.016, "neu": 0.621, "pos": 0.363, "compound": 0.9928}, "body": "Himanshu Roy was walking his dog, Rio, through his home area of Vesu, part of the Indian city of Surat, when he saw the man and the elephant. \u201cWe don\u2019t often see elephants here; Vesu is a very developed and residential area,\u201d Roy says. \u201cShe and her owner had just arrived for a diksha ceremony, when a person renounces their wealthy life and donates everything they have to follow a spiritual path.\u201d After rushing home to drop off Rio, Roy returned. \u201cThe foggy morning weather and the dust from the ground couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for creating a striking image; I emphasised both in the edit, as well as converting it to black and white.\u201d Roy credits his iPhone with enabling such spontaneity. \u201cOf course, phones and digital cameras each have their pros and cons \u2013 both can help you create amazing photos if you use them well,\u201d he adds.

The quarrel at the \u00a340m Actors\u2019 Benevolent Fund (ABF) has also triggered fierce criticism of the Charity Commission. In a rare admission of fault, the watchdog has accepted it made serious errors in its two-year handling of the controversy. The row has played out since a dramatic takeover in 2022 resulted in the contentious ousting from the fund\u2019s ruling body of its former president Dame Penelope Keith, and actors including Dame Si\u00e2n Phillips and James Bolam, by a group of rival trustees. Since then the two sides have been engaged in a costly war of words conducted through the media and lawyers\u2019 letters, with the \u201cousted\u201d trustees and their supporters arguing their removal from the board was illegal. The ABF operates hardship funds for actors and stagehands in England and Wales who are in need. Its patron is King Charles, and famous past presidents include Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Gielgud. It gave out \u00a3900,000 in grants to 430 beneficiaries in 2022. The row has flared again as the fund\u2019s 750 members prepare to vote for a new council on Wednesday, amid accusations that the charity\u2019s ruling body has tried to marginalise candidates who have publicly criticised it, including the Harry Potter star Miriam Margolyes and Cold Feet\u2019s Robert Bathurst. The pair have been placed by a nominations committee on a list of six \u201cother\u201d candidates on the voting papers, in contrast to the \u201crecommended\u201d list of 12 candidates, which includes five existing trustees, including the fund\u2019s president, the actor Esh Alladi, who has overseen the fund for the past two years. Several new \u201cfresh blood\u201d candidates are on the recommended list, including the actor and biographer Simon Callow, the Birds of Feather actor Lesley Joseph, and Rob Rinder, best known for the reality courtroom TV show Judge Rinder. A spokesperson for the fund rejected the claim it had sought to influence voters through the ballot forms. It had appointed an independent nominations committee to identify the best candidates and \u201censure a robust, fair and independent process of the highest order\u201d, they said. The spokesperson added: \u201cIt is [the nomination committee\u2019s] expert opinion that the recommended 12, with their array of skills and experience, would be the most effective in running the charity. It is in the best interests of the charity therefore to make this clear to the members.\u201d Charity law experts are alarmed that the removal of Keith and her colleagues in 2022 not only breached company law but was in effect subsequently condoned by the Charity Commission, which has been supervising the fund since early 2022. A series of letters of complaint from Keith to the commission\u2019s chief executive, Helen Stephenson, in the summer resulted in the regulator agreeing to undertake an internal investigation into its handling of the case. That investigation, by a senior commission official, is now complete. It concluded Keith and the excluded trustees were treated unfairly, and that the commission \u2013 which privately admitted the 2022 council election that facilitated the board takeover was \u201cflawed\u201d \u2013 was wrong to side with the ousting trustees. However, the commission has offered no apology or remedy to Keith, and has so far refused to address her complaint that it misused its powers when it formally ratified the \u201cousting\u201d trustees in April 2023. The ousted trustees are considering whether to take legal action against the commission. Bathurst, who qualified as a barrister before becoming an actor, said the regulator\u2019s errors had caused avoidable financial and reputational damage to the fund. \u201cI\u2019m sure charity lawyers will be looking keenly at this to see how easy it is to take over a charity unlawfully under the nose of the Charity Commission,\u201d he said. A commission spokesperson said: \u201cWe stand by our decision to intervene in this damaging and costly dispute about the Actors\u2019 Benevolent Fund governance.

Watching it was like holding up a mirror: it made me question my behaviour as a gay man and how I can be more authentic in my homosexuality. It\u2019s about a young man who is writing a musical and trying to represent the experience of being Black and queer. His family wants him to do a religious, Tyler Perry-style musical, but he wants to have a fresh take. The performers were incredible and the choreography was sumptuous, but what was really special to me was how it hit a nerve and raised so many important questions. 2. YouTube Soft White Underbelly This is a very interesting and quite shocking series of interviews with people in Los Angeles who\u2019ve had their lives turned upside down: homeless people, rape victims, people with addiction. The interviewer, the photographer Mark Laita, is very frank and direct with his questions. One interviewee I\u2019ve found particularly inspiring is Rebecca, a trans woman with incredible views on politics, beauty and society. The series is voyeuristic but I\u2019m learning so much from watching it, and I look at people struggling with homelessness or addiction in a different way. 3. Art Marina Abramovi\u0107 at the Royal Academy In New York a few years ago, I remember seeing the massive queues outside MoMA for Marina Abramovi\u0107\u2019s show The Artist Is Present. Since then, I\u2019ve been mesmerised by her work, so it was nice to finally experience it first-hand at the Royal Academy. This exhibition covered key moments from her career as a performance artist: the bow and arrow film [Rest Energy], the naked couple in the doorway that you\u2019ve got to squeeze past. The show really takes you on a journey through her life. I loved it so much, I went twice. 4. Film Rotting in the Sun I loved this movie. The director, Sebasti\u00e1n Silva, creates really intimate and interesting films and has a very specific voice. Here, he plays a film-maker in Mexico City who is struggling with his identity and his work. He meets a horrific LA-based influencer and they decide to collaborate, but then something unexpected happens and the movie completely changes. It was a magical experience to be surprised like this in the cinema. It\u2019s the most fascinating movie, hilarious, satirical and dark. And Catalina Saavedra gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s housekeeper Vero. 5. Music Stormzy at All Points East festival This Stormzy concert in August was magical. I love Stormzy. He holds culture in his voice, and his charisma is so powerful that when he came on stage I had shivers going down me. He started with a very emotional part of his album where he reflects on the world and how kids are taught to be and what they\u2019re exposed to. Then he moved on to heavier songs with powerful beats. When he sang about rain falling on his enemies, the rain started pouring down. It was such a cinematic moment \u2013 everyone in the crowd was exhilarated. 6. Restaurant Planque, London E8 This is a restaurant in east London with a gorgeous atmosphere, amazing food and the most incredible wine list. Whenever I go, I have a great time. It\u2019s in the arches beneath an overground station so it looks quite unassuming from the outside, but inside it\u2019s got this quiet luxury that I love so much. The last time I went, the monkfish was excellent and I had calf\u2019s brains, which I\u2019d never tried before but really enjoyed. There\u2019s an effortlessness and openness to the place and lots of surprising elements.

Younger employees could eventually increase their retirement pots by more than \u00a3100,000 by diverting their monthly gain from the national insurance (NI) cut into their pension. Last Saturday, the main rate of national insurance contributions (NICs) paid by employees dropped from 12% to 10%. Ministers say 27 million UK employees are benefiting from this reduction, which was announced in November. Someone on an annual salary of \u00a330,000 will have an extra \u00a3348 in their pocket each year; for higher earners the gain is up to \u00a3754 a year. Many people will need that cash to help with bills and other essential costs such as buying groceries or paying down debts. For those who can afford it, Dean Butler, at the pension provider Standard Life, says it is worth paying it into a pension: \u201cWhile it\u2019s tempting to see this as extra spending money, it\u2019s worth trying to save at least a portion of it. \u201cEven small additional contributions now could give you a big retirement boost.\u201d Bertrand Pole, at the wealth management firm Evelyn Partners, says workers are often advised to pay more into their pension when they get a pay rise because it will give their long-term finances a significant boost, but they won\u2019t feel any worse off on a month-to-month basis. \u201cThe same applies here, as the NI cut is a perfect opportunity to increase retirement savings without making sacrifices,\u201d he says. Evelyn Partners crunched the numbers to see what the potential gains could be. The figures are based on someone\u2019s pension contributions being increased each month by an amount equal to the gain from the NI cut, so their take-home pay stays the same, with tax relief then added. A basic-rate taxpayer will in theory see their income rise by up to \u00a362.83 a month as a result of the NI reduction. If they pay this straight into their pension, it will be worth \u00a378.53 a month because of the 20% tax relief on contributions. Younger workers will enjoy a bigger boost to their retirement savings because there is more time for their investments to grow. According to Evelyn Partners, a 25-year-old basic-rate taxpayer could end up with as much as \u00a3134,300 extra in their pot, assuming that they work and save until age 67. For a 55-year-old, the uplift could be \u00a315,500. The figures are higher for higher-rate taxpayers as that \u00a362.83 turns into a \u00a3105 contribution because of the 40% tax relief they get. As a result, a 25-year-old higher-rate taxpayer could be up to \u00a3179,600 better off by age 67, while for a 55-year-old, there could be an extra \u00a320,800. The calculations assume that people\u2019s pots grow by 5% a year after fees. However, other factors could increase the final figures: for example, some employers will match, or part-match, extra contributions made by employees, which would mean more going into their fund. Instead of carrying on working to their target retirement age and then benefiting from their bigger pot, some of those who divert the extra cash to their pension could decide to retire from work a few years earlier than originally planned. The NI reduction involves \u201cclass 1\u201d contributions made on earnings received by anyone between the age of 16 and state pension age who is getting more than \u00a3242 a week from one job. It means employees now pay 10% on earnings between \u00a3242 and \u00a3967 a week.", "date": "2024-01-13", "section": "Money", "author": "Rupert Jones", "id": 538, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/43d2fe267899da5713614ae91187dc17e11552ce/955_838_4609_2765/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Environment Agency accused of \u2018scandalous neglect\u2019 over chicken excrement entering River Wye", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/13/environment-agency-accused-of-scandalous-neglect-over-chicken-excrement-entering-river-wye", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.074, "neu": 0.719, "pos": 0.208, "compound": 0.996}, "body": "The Environment Agency faces new allegations of neglect of the River Wye after a project by a conservation group found effluent and contaminated waters at free-range egg farms flowing directly into watercourses. Of 47 sites visited in England and Wales in the Wye catchment, 19 had drains running from the poultry units to a nearby watercourse. Many of the farms had drains excavated within a few metres of the sheds. Charles Watson, chair of River Action, the charity that obtained details of the advisory visits to free-range egg farms under freedom of information laws, said: \u201cThese documents show a large number of intensive egg production farms have been allowing the excrement of hundreds of thousands of chickens to run off, without any proper mitigation, straight into the river system. \u201cThis is in clear breach of the regulations, and the bodies protecting the environment have largely been in denial while this has been going on. There has been scandalous neglect over the years.\u201d The Wye has been blighted by poultry pollution with hundreds of new production units approved in the last two decades to feed the nation\u2019s huge demand. The condition of the river was downgraded last May after campaigners warned its ecosystem had been devastated by intensive poultry production. The advisory visits to farms were conducted by the Wye and Usk Foundation, which works to improve the ecology of those two rivers. The visits were done in partnership with free-range egg farmers, including suppliers to Noble Foods, owner of the free-range brand the Happy Egg Company. In an email to Environment Agency (EA) officials sent last February, the foundation said drainage water from the farms was \u201ca pollution risk and should not be directed to watercourses\u201d. It added that the issue was \u201cvery common and one that we have found very difficult to address\u201d. The charity was seeking guidance as to how the runoff should be treated. It is working with farmers to improve protection of the catchment area from effluent and agricultural drainage water. Simon Evans, chief executive of the foundation, said: \u2018Many of the challenges we are trying to resolve are the legacy of historic poor planning decisions, such as when the planners have insisted the units be located too close to watercourses. \u201cIn some cases, the solutions are not obvious and require careful consideration along with guidance from regulators. Noble has been actively engaged in helping to find and fund solutions on the farms that supply them, and their support is driving the progress that is being made to resolve the issues.\u201d River Action is seeking a judicial review of the EA over allegations it had failed to protect the Wye from agricultural pollution. It is claimed the agency has failed to prevent the spreading of excess organic manure or properly apply the rules. Ricardo Gama, a solicitor at Leigh Day, which is representing River Action in the judicial review, due to be heard next month at the high court in Cardiff, said: \u201cRiver Action\u2019s ultimate goal is that the agency takes a strong hand and actually starts enforcing these rules.\u201d The EA said: \u201cWe recognise the River Wye is under pressure, which is why we are already offering a wide range of support to farmers around the river to speed up their transition to more sustainable practices. We work closely with groups like the Wye and Usk Foundation, who provide advice to farmers. \u201cIn the Wye catchment, we carried out 493 farm inspections and issued 285 improvement actions from 1 April to 31 December 2023. These inspections targeted high-priority catchments such as protected habitats, and those where intelligence indicated rule breaches and pollution.\u201d Noble Foods said: \u201cOver the last three years [we] have been working hard with our producer base in the Wye and Usk region. We are supplied by family-run farms in the region, which represent less than 5% of the total poultry flock in the area. We are encouraging our producers to embrace nature-based solutions, such as wetland pools, as part of our work with the Wye and Usk Foundation.\u201d Gary Ford, chief executive of British Egg Industry Council said it was \u201ccommitted to complying with legal requirements and ensuring that egg production does not adversely impact the local environmental infrastructure.\u201d He said the council was funding a number of independent research projects in this subject area. \u201cThe initial evidence suggests that the impact of free-range farming is likely to have a minimal, if any, direct effect on the increased phosphate levels in the Rivers Wye and Usk.\u201d Rhian Jardine, head of development planning at Natural Resources Wales, said: \u201c[Welsh Water] has published data which indicates that rural land use is contributing to 72% of phosphorus loading of the upper Wye. We will use all the resources at our disposal to prevent pollution. We also recognise that we can\u2019t reach lasting solutions alone.

She was locked down in Oslo, where she has lived for the past 40 years with her wife and children, and found herself thinking about the shape of the years to come. \u201cI asked myself what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI was 62 and I might only have 15 or 20 good years left. I realised that I should do the things that I had wanted to do and not leave it for another day. It was the push I needed.\u201d What she had always wanted to do was dive. Ever since she devoured Jules Verne\u2019s sci-fi classic Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea as a 10-year-old, Babayan has harboured a love of the ocean. Despite growing up in landlocked Tehran, 1,200m above sea level, she would dream about living in a glass dome underwater and when her family took her on holidays to the Caspian Sea, she would spend as much time as possible swimming. \u201cIt was a fantasy life for me as an only child,\u201d she says. \u201cI lived in my imagination and the ocean was just endless with wonder.\u201d In 2021, after decades spent working in adult education, Babayan enrolled in a diving certification course to finally make her dreams of exploring the ocean come true. She took her written theory test and soon began trying out diving equipment in a pool. At first, it was a struggle. \u201cEach body floats differently, so you have to get your weighting right, otherwise you don\u2019t sink properly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can feel really tiresome, like you\u2019re always struggling.\u201d Once her instructors found her correct weighting, she then began diving in open water, but that also brought its challenges. \u201cI started in November and the water in the fjords in Norway was so cold,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI had to wear a drysuit, which was really heavy and uncomfortable \u2013 I didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d Still determined to have a positive experience, a month later Babayan took to warmer waters on a family holiday to Lanzarote and eventually managed her debut dive. \u201cThe first time I dived successfully, it was as if I was flying,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see fish swimming above you, which is so strange, and it gave me that feeling of freedom I had imagined as a child. I knew then that this is what I wanted to continue doing.\u201d Since that first trip, Babayan, now 65, tries to fit in at least two diving holidays each year and still finds that same sense of adventure each time she sinks into the water. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating seeing all the marine life, but it\u2019s also so calm because the only thing you hear is your own breathing,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to concentrate on your breath, almost like meditation.\u201d One recent trip involved diving in a cave in Sardinia and plunging into a \u201cworld within a world\u201d. \u201cThe silence was amazing,\u201d she says. It might sound terrifying to some but Babayan makes sure to always dive with an instructor at hand and to not stray much deeper than 20 metres. Diving has remained a solo pursuit. Babayan\u2019s wife hasn\u2019t trained because she wears glasses and contact lenses, while her grandchildren mainly find it amusing that their granny enjoys such an adventure sport. Still, Babayan finds strength in having the experience for herself, no matter her age. \u201cYour age is in other people\u2019s eyes and our bodies are far more resilient than we know,\u201d she says. \u201cI have never encountered any issues or prejudice about being an older diver. I have a medical checkup every two years to keep my certification and as long as that\u2019s OK I will carry on.\u201d She travelled to Hanoi for her most recent diving trip before journeying farther south in Vietnam to explore the South China Sea. \u201cOne of the perks of growing older is that you don\u2019t have to worry about what other people might think of you any more,\u201d she says. \u201cGo out and try whatever it is you\u2019ve been waiting to do.

Half a century later, Wilson sought and received Lewis\u2019s forgiveness. Then both men appeared on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s TV show. Wilson looked overwhelmed, panicked by the bright lights of the studio, where nearly 180 of Lewis\u2019s fellow civil rights activists had gathered. But then Lewis smiled, leaned over, gently held Wilson\u2019s hand and insisted: \u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d There was not a dry eye in the house. Raymond Arsenault, author of the first full-length biography of Lewis, the late congressman from Georgia, describes this act of compassion and reconciliation as a quintessential moment. \u201cFor him, it was all about forgiveness,\u201d Arsenault says. \u201cThat\u2019s the central theme of his life. He believed that you couldn\u2019t let your enemies pull you down into the ditch with them, that you had to love your enemies as much as you loved your friends and your loved ones.\u201d It was the secret weapon, the way to catch enemies off-guard. Bernard Lafayette, a Freedom Rider and close friend of Lewis, a key source for Arsenault, calls it moral jujitsu. Arsenault adds: \u201cThey\u2019re expecting you to react like a normal human being. When you don\u2019t, when you don\u2019t hate them, it opens up all kinds of possibilities. The case of Mr Wilson was classic. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my lifetime, for sure.\u201d Arsenault, a history professor at the University of South Florida, St Petersburg, has written books about the Freedom Riders \u2013 civil rights activists who rode buses across the south in 1961 to challenge segregation in transportation \u2013 and two African American cultural giants: contralto Marian Anderson and tennis player Arthur Ashe. He first met Lewis in 2000, in Lewis\u2019s congressional office in Washington DC, a mini museum of books, photos and civil rights memorabilia. \u201cThe first day I met him, I called him \u2018Congressman Lewis\u2019 and he said: \u2018Get that out of here. I\u2019m John. Everybody calls me John.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t an affectation. He meant it. He seemed to value human beings in such an equalitarian way.\u201d Lewis asked for Arsenault\u2019s help tracking down Freedom Riders for a 40th anniversary reunion. It was the start of a friendship that would last until Lewis\u2019s death, at 80 from pancreatic cancer, in 2020. \u201cFrom the very start I saw that he was an absolutely extraordinary human being,\u201d Arsenault says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever met anyone quite like him \u2013 absolutely without ego, selfless. People have called him saintly and that\u2019s probably fairly accurate.\u201d Arsenault was approached to write a biography by the historian David Blight, who with Henry Louis Gates Jr and Jacqueline Goldsby sits on the advisory board of the Yale University Press Black Lives series. The resulting book, John Lewis: In Search of the Beloved Community, examines a rare journey from protest leader to career politician, buffeted by the winds of Black nationalism, debates over the acceptability of violence and perennial tensions between purity and pragmatism. Arsenault says Lewis \u201cwas certainly more complicated than I thought he would be when I started. He tried to keep his balance, but it was not easy because a lot of people wanted him to be what is sometimes called in the movement a \u2018race man\u2019 and he wasn\u2019t a race man, even though he was proud of being African American and very connected to where he came from. He was always more of a human rights person than a civil rights person. \u201cIf he had to choose between racial loyalty or solidarity and his deeper values about the Beloved Community [Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s vision of a just and compassionate society], he always chose the Beloved Community and it got him in hot water. He, for example, was criticised for attacking Clarence Thomas during the [1991 supreme court nomination] hearings and of course he proved to be absolutely right on that one. \u201cThere were other cases where if there was a good white candidate running and a Black man who wasn\u2019t so good, he\u2019d choose the white candidate and he didn\u2019t apologise for it. He took a lot of heat for that. Now he\u2019s such a beloved figure sometimes people forget that he marched to his own drummer.\u201d Lewis\u2019s philosophy represented a confluence of Black Christianity and the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, Arsenault says. \u201cHe had this broader vision. There\u2019s not a progressive cause that you can mention that he wasn\u2019t involved with in some way or another. \u201cHe was a major environmentalist. There was a lot of homophobia in the Black community in those years but not even a hint [in Lewis]. He was also a philosemite: he associated Jews as being people of the Old Testament and he was so attracted to them as natural allies. Never even a moment of antisemitism or anything like that. He was totally ahead of his time in so many ways.\u201d \u2018A man of action\u2019 Lewis was born in 1940, outside Troy in Pike county, Alabama, one of 10 children. He grew up on his family\u2019s farm, without electricity or indoor plumbing, and attended segregated public schools in the era of Jim Crow. As a boy, he wanted to be a minister. Arsenault says: \u201cI have a picture of him in the book when he was 11; they actually ran something in the newspaper about this boy preacher. He had something of a speech impediment but preached to the chickens on the farm. They were like his children or his congregation, his flock, and he loved to tell those stories. \u201cBut he was always bookish, different from his big brothers and sisters. He loved school. He loved to read. In fact his first protesting was to try to get a library card at the all-white library.\u201d Denied a library card, Lewis became an avid reader anyway. He was a teenager when he first heard King preach, on the radio. They met when Lewis was seeking support to become the first Black student at the segregated Troy State University. \u201cHe was a good student and a conscientious student but he realised that he was a man of action, as he liked to say. He loved words but was always putting his body on the line. It\u2019s a miracle he survived, frankly, more than 40 beatings, more than 40 arrests and jailings, far more than any other major figure. You could add all the others up and they wouldn\u2019t equal the times that John was behind bars.\u201d Lewis began organising sit-in demonstrations at whites-only lunch counters and volunteering as a Freedom Rider, enduring beatings and arrests. He helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), becoming its chair in 1963. That year, he was among the \u201cBig Six\u201d organisers of the civil rights movement and the March on Washington, where at the last minute he agreed to tone down his speech. Still, Lewis made his point, with what Arsenault calls \u201cfar and away the most radical speech given that day\u201d. In 1965, after extensive training in non-violent protest, Lewis, still only 25, and the Rev Hosea Williams led hundreds of demonstrators on a march of more than 50 miles from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama\u2019s capital. In Selma, police blocked their way off the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Troopers wielded truncheons, fired tear gas and charged on horseback. Walking with his hands tucked in the pockets of his tan overcoat, Lewis was knocked to the ground and beaten, suffering a fractured skull. Televised images of such state violence forced a reckoning with southern racial oppression. Lewis returned to and crossed the bridge every year and never tired of talking about it, Arsenault says: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t one to talk about himself so much, but he was a good storyteller and Bloody Sunday was a huge deal for him. He said later he thought he was going to die, that this was it. \u201cHe passed through an incredible rite of passage as a non-violent activist and nothing could ever be as bad again. He\u2019d been through the fire and so it made him tougher and more resilient. It\u2019s origins of the legend. He was well considered as a Freedom Rider, certainly, and already had a reputation but that solidified it and extended it in a way that made him a folk hero within the movement.\u201d Lewis turned to politics. In 1981, he was elected to the Atlanta city council. Five years later he won a seat in Congress. He would serve 17 terms. After Democrats won the House in 2006, Lewis became senior deputy whip, widely revered as the \u201cconscience of the Congress\u201d. Once a young SNCC firebrand, sceptical of politics, he became a national institution and a party man \u2013 up to a point. \u201cThat tension was always there,\u201d Arsenault reflects. \u201cHe tried to be as practical and pragmatic as he needed to be but that wasn\u2019t his bent. \u201cHe was much more in it for the long haul in terms of an almost utopian attitude about the Beloved Community. He probably enjoyed it more when he was a protest leader, when he was kind of a rebel. Maybe it\u2019s not right to say he didn\u2019t feel comfortable in Washington, but his heart was back in Atlanta and in Pike county. As his chief of staff once said, wherever he went in the world, he took Pike county with him.\u201d The fire never dimmed. Even in his 70s, Lewis led a sit-in protest in the House chamber, demanding tougher gun controls. As a congressman, he was arrested five times. \u201cHe was absolutely determined and, as he once said: \u2018I\u2019m not a showboat, I\u2019m a tugboat.\u2019 He loved that line. Nothing fancy. Just a person who did the hard work and was always willing to put his body on the line,\u201d Arsenault says. \u2018If he hated anyone, it was probably Trump\u2019 Lewis endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2008 but switched to Barack Obama, who became the first Black president. Obama honoured Lewis with the presidential medal of freedom and in 2015, on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, they marched hand in hand in Selma. Lewis backed Clinton again in 2016 but was thwarted by Donald Trump. Arsenault says: \u201cHe was thrilled by the idea of an Obama presidency and thought the world was heading in the right direction. He worked hard for Hillary in 2016 and thought for sure she was going to win, so it was just a devastating thing, as it was for a lot of us. He tried not to hate anyone and never would vocalise it but, if he hated anyone, it was probably Trump. He had contempt for him. He thought he was an awful man. \u201cThat was something I had to deal with in writing the book, because you like to think it\u2019s going to be an ascending arc of hopefulness and things are going to get better over time, but in John Lewis\u2019s life, the last three years were probably the worst in many respects because he thought that American democracy itself was on the line.\u201d When Lewis died, Washington united in mourning \u2013 with a notable exception. Trump said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t come to my inauguration. He didn\u2019t come to my State of the Union speeches. And that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s his right. And, again, nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have.\u201d Arsenault says: \u201cThey were almost like antithetical figures. Lewis was the anti-Trump in every conceivable way, but when he died in July 2020 he probably thought Trump was going to win re-election. Within the limits of his physical strength, which wasn\u2019t great at that point, he did what he could, but the pancreatic cancer was so devastating from December 2019 until he died. \u201cIt was tough to deal with that part of the story but, in some ways, maybe it\u2019s not all that surprising for someone whose whole life was beating the odds and going against the grain. He had suffered plenty of disappointments before that. It just made him more determined, tougher, and he was absolutely defiant of Trump.\u201d Lewis enjoyed positive relationships with Republicans. \u201cHe was such a saintly person that whenever there were votes about the most admired person in Congress, it was always John Lewis. Even Republicans who didn\u2019t agree with his politics but realised he was something special as a human being, as a man. \u201cHe had always been able to work across the aisle, probably better than most Democratic congressmen. He didn\u2019t demonise the Republicans. It was Trumpism, this new form of politics, in some ways a throwback to the southern demagoguery of the early 20th century, this politics of persecution and thinly veiled racism. He passed without much sense that we were any closer to the Beloved Community.\u201d Lewis did live to see the flowering of the Black Lives Matter movement after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He was inspired, a day before he went into hospital, to visit Black Lives Matter Plaza, near the White House. \u201cFor him it was the most incredible outpouring of non-violent spirit in the streets that he\u2019d ever seen, that anybody had ever seen,\u201d Arsenault says. \u201cThat was enormously gratifying for him. He thought that in some sense his message had gotten through and people were acting on these ideals of Dr King and Gandhi. \u201cThat was hugely important to him and to reinforcing his values and his beliefs and his hopes. I don\u2019t think he was despondent at all because of that. If that had not happened, who knows? But he\u2019d weathered the storms before and that\u2019s what helped him to weather this storm, because it was it was so important to him.\u201d Lewis enjoyed fishing, African American quilts, sweet potato pie, listening to music and, as deathless videos testify, dancing with joy. Above all, Arsenault hopes readers of his book will be moved by Lewis\u2019s fidelity to the promise of non-violence. \u201cWhen you think about what\u2019s happening in Gaza and the Middle East and Ukraine right now, it\u2019s horrible violence \u2013 and more than ever we need these lessons of the power of non-violence. [Lewis] was the epitome of it. You can\u2019t help but come away with an admiration for what he was able to do in his lifetime, how far he travelled. He had no advantages in any way. \u201cThe idea that he was able to have this life and career and the American people and the world would be exposed to a man like this \u2013 in some ways he is like Nelson Mandela. He didn\u2019t spend nearly 30 years in prison, but I think of them as similar in many ways. I hope people will be inspired to think about making the kind of sacrifices that he made. He gave everybody the benefit of the doubt.\u201d John Lewis: In Search of the Beloved Community is published in the US by Yale University Press", "date": "2024-01-15", "section": "Books", "author": "David Smith in Washington", "id": 541, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/10db656720794bb3a05c931a5d52901d0e1fe60c/0_0_2999_1800/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018His success was rammed down my throat\u2019: Charlie Chaplin\u2019s son Michael on fame, failure and finding peace", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/15/charlie-chaplin-son-michael-fame-failure-finding-peace", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.129, "neu": 0.663, "pos": 0.208, "compound": 0.9995}, "body": "Michael J Chaplin tells a story about an ancient sect that only counted a man\u2019s age from the day his father died. It has resonated with him ever since he heard about it. On this score, he is 46 years old \u2013 his father, Charlie Chaplin, died on Christmas Day in 1977. On a more conventional score, Michael is 77 and about to publish his first novel. A Fallen God is a retelling of the medieval romance Tristan and Isolde set in the 13th century. Apart from his family (he\u2019s been married twice and has seven children), he says it\u2019s the first thing he has done in his life that he\u2019s truly proud of. He likes to see the day his father died as a rebirth. It\u2019s not that Michael disliked his dad. He loved him and couldn\u2019t have admired him more. After all, Chaplin Sr is not only one of the greatest actors ever, but the first ever global celebrity, recognisable by his silhouette alone. The moustache, bowler hat, walking stick and splayed feet of his creation The Little Tramp remains iconic. There were so many remarkable scenes in his films \u2013 Charlie caught in the cogs of capitalism in Modern Times; the blind flower girl seeing him for the first time at the end of City Lights; prospectors struggling up the snowbound Chilkoot pass in the The Gold Rush; the Jewish barber, pleading for kindness while impersonating fascist leader Adenoid Hynkel in The Great Dictator. And that\u2019s just the start of it. Charlie was a one-man film industry \u2013 writer, director, producer, editor and even composer of the movies made at his own studio. In 1919, he co-founded the distribution company United Artists, giving him complete control over his films. There were the controversies, too. While he was feted as a cinematic visionary, he was demonised by FBI director J Edgar Hoover for his alleged communist sympathies and proclivity for teenage girls, and feared by some he worked with for his control freakery. \u201cHe cast a huge shadow over me,\u201d says Michael, the second of eight children from Chaplin\u2019s fourth and final marriage, to Oona O\u2019Neill (Charlie had 11 children in total). He was dwarfed by his father\u2019s personality, intimidated by his power and sometimes simply scared of him. For much of his life, he says, he has been trying to find a purpose. \u201cIn my early years, I just drifted from one thing to another, I wasn\u2019t doing anything solid.\u201d Was he aware of his father\u2019s genius as a little boy? He nods. \u201cYes, but in a negative way. It was rammed down my throat. My teachers would always say: \u2018You\u2019ll never be like your father.\u2019\u201d He tried his hand at acting and pop music, briefly became infamous as a pot-smoking hippy in swinging 60s London, and spent many years running a goat farm in a remote part of south-west France. He says it was only after his father died that he realised what he really wanted to do with his life: write. \u201cOnce he died, I thought: \u2018Yes, now I should write the novel. I should go ahead and do something.\u2019\u201d It was a new start? \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d But progress wasn\u2019t quick. Michael is one of life\u2019s great procrastinators and it\u2019s taken him the best part of a half-century to produce something worthwhile. \u201cI tried to write novels when I was younger. I thought I\u2019d have plenty to say, then when I sat down with the pen and paper I found I had nothing to say.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt was very upsetting.\u201d One day a friend took him aside and told him that the problem with his writing was that it was superficial, that it never dealt with deeper truths. \u201cHe said: \u2018Michael, your problem is you\u2019re afraid to put yourself down on the page.\u2019 He was right. I had to be braver. Put yourself, your weakness in the characters. It has to come from within you.\u201d * * * Bravery is a recurring theme in Michael\u2019s life \u2013 and in his novel. His father, he says, was astonishingly brave. Charlie\u2019s parents, both music hall performers, separated before he was five. He barely knew his alcoholic father, while his beloved mother lived with mental illness throughout her adult life. Charlie and his brother Sydney spent their early years in and out of Lambeth Workhouse in London. And yet from this desperate start, he reached unimaginable heights \u2013 creatively and financially. He died one of the wealthiest men in the film industry, leaving an estimated $100m to his family (roughly $500m, adjusted for inflation). Michael could not have been more different: ambition to him was a filthy word. A Fallen God is a beautifully told epic fairytale for all ages. While adults may wrestle with themes of church and state, action and inaction, and the transformative power of love, it could be read to kids as a bedtime story. The obvious hero is Tristan \u2013 a swashbuckling man of action, irresistible to Isolde. It\u2019s possible to see Charlie in the character, but Michael insists that was not his intention. By contrast, Isolde\u2019s husband, King Mark, is passive to the point of paralysis until he finally learns the importance of fighting for love. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m Mark,\u201d he says. In what way? \u201cI\u2019ve been through the things he\u2019s been through. I haven\u2019t been a very dynamic person. I wasn\u2019t doing anything with my life. I was quite happy but it was a problem for my wife, it was a problem for my wife\u2019s father, and it became a problem for the children. I had no ambition at all.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always this way. In the 60s, Michael seemed very much like a man of action. He spent his first few years in Beverly Hills, California, where his father was a victim of McCarthyism. Charlie sided with the left, refused to cross picket lines in the 1945-46 Hollywood strikes, and supported the Progressive party candidate Henry Wallace in the 1948 presidential election. He insisted he was not a communist (\u201cI do not want to create any revolution, all I want to do is create a few more films,\u201d he said) but the FBI was determined to destroy him. It fed classified information and rumours (often about relationships with much younger women) to the Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and, before long, Charlie was regarded as a traitor in the United States. By 1952, his film Limelight, which featured Michael in the opening shot, was being picketed. Charlie had never applied for citizenship and, while he was sailing to London with the family to promote Limelight, the US government revoked his re-entry permit. The family moved to Switzerland, where Michael spent the rest of his childhood living in a neoclassical mansion on the banks of Lake Geneva. Did Michael know why they were suddenly living on a different continent? \u201cNo. I was six years old when we were on the ship coming to Europe and he received a telegram saying he couldn\u2019t go back to America. I heard it without understanding.\u201d Michael would ask his mother when they would return home \u2013 but she would never reply. His father was in a terrible state. \u201cHe thought he could lose all his money, which was in America,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother took a plane back to sign all the money into Mexico.\u201d It must have been terrifying for him, I say. \u201cI think so. But he\u2019s a fighter.\u201d Does he still think of his father in the present tense? \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s in there somewhere.\u201d * * * Michael is with his wife, the painter Patricia Betaudier Chaplin, in M\u00e1laga when we Zoom. He spends part of the year there, part in Switzerland. He looks like a rough-hewn version of his father, with a touch of Willie Nelson thrown in for good measure. A fedora is perched on his head, his leather jacket is gnarled and his white ponytail slides down his back. He\u2019s clearly never lost his inner \u2013 or outer \u2013 hippy. I ask what Charlie was like as a father. \u201cIntimidating,\u201d he says. He was tough, unyielding and often remote with his sons. Less so with his daughters. Michael believes Charlie\u2019s lack of a male role model as a child resulted in him struggling with his sons. \u201cHe never really mentioned his father. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever really seen or known him, but he\u2019d talk about his mother endlessly. He adored her. \u201cHe always said: \u2018I\u2019m a loner, I have no friends.\u2019\u201d Was that true? \u201cNot really. He had a big family and loads of friends that came to the house: Graeme Greene, Truman Capote, No\u00ebl Coward, loads of writers.\u201d Michael pauses. Actually, he says, most of them were really friends of his mother\u2019s. Oona, Charlie\u2019s fourth wife, was the daughter of the playwright Eugene O\u2019Neill. She loved writers. She married Chaplin when she was 18 and he was 54. \u201cI had a very close relationship with my mother,\u201d Michael says. \u201cShe gave me an appetite for reading. She introduced me to books like L\u2019Etranger by Camus.\u201d Did she write herself? \u201cShe wrote wonderful letters \u2013 funny, colourful and gossipy. She asked them to be destroyed after her death.\u201d Why? \u201cShe kept herself in the shadows. It was where she was comfortable.\u201d It was hard not to be in the shadows around his father. Michael talks of his first experience on a film set with him, when Charlie was making Limelight. \u201cI remember this huge studio, and hearing my father\u2019s voice through a loudspeaker. I couldn\u2019t see him. He was saying: \u2018No! Go over there!\u2019 I was quite intimidated.\u201d When Michael was 10, Charlie cast him in A King in New York. The film, a satire of the McCarthy witch-hunt, was Charlie\u2019s final leading role. Michael played a precocious teenager well versed in Marx \u2013 a sharp contrast to Michael who had never read a political text in his life. Did he enjoy working with his father? \u201cI loved it. It had a biblical side to it. In ancient days, the sons went to work with their father in the field or wherever, and it felt like that.\u201d The film gave him a taste for acting. But Charlie, who had no formal education, was determined that his sons in particular do well academically. \u201cHe said: \u2018Your only defence in this world is to be educated.\u2019\u201d Did Michael listen? \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t listen to him ... I couldn\u2019t listen in school. I couldn\u2019t hear the teacher even if I was interested. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d He was tested for dyslexia. \u201cThere was a French teacher I liked, and she said: \u2018Don\u2019t let them tell you that you\u2019ve got dyslexia \u2013 you\u2019re just lazy.\u2019\u201d Did that make him feel better or worse? \u201cBetter. I didn\u2019t want to have a condition.\u201d His father\u2019s patience with him wore thin. Charlie could be so funny and playful, but his son rarely saw that side. \u201cWhen he wanted to, he could entertain us. He was great at mime. He had a lot of weapons to amuse us with.\u201d Did his father teach him his skills? \u201cNo, he did with his daughters. He, Geraldine and Victoria would do duets on the piano. He related to them. I never felt that he didn\u2019t love us, but he could get very angry and frustrated.\u201d Did the anger express itself in physical violence? \u201cNo. He gave me a few spankings but that was normal in the 50s.\u201d As Michael got older, their relationship became more troubled. At 16, he ran away to be with his girlfriend. \u201cI said I was going camping with friends and I went straight to London to see her. I didn\u2019t come back for two years.\u201d How did his parents react? \u201cMy father wouldn\u2019t speak to me.\u201d At 18, he started a relationship with the actor Patricia Johns (now Patrice Chaplin), who was seven years his senior. They tried to get married in Barcelona, but because Michael was so young he needed his parents\u2019 permission. They refused to grant it. Didn\u2019t it strike him as hypocritical that his father, whose first two wives were both 16, wouldn\u2019t let him marry a woman of 25? \u201cI didn\u2019t make the connection,\u201d he says. Charlie met his second wife, Lita Grey, when she was 15 and he was 35. When she became pregnant, her mother threatened to report him to the police. He could have been charged with statutory rape in California. A discreet marriage was hastily arranged in Mexico. When they divorced three years later, Grey accused him of statutory rape, seduction of a minor, soliciting abortions and \u201cperverted sexual desires\u201d, details of which were leaked to the press. The judge awarded Grey the world\u2019s then-largest divorce settlement of more than $800,000 (approximately $14m today) \u2013 $625,000 for her, and $100,000 to be placed in a trust for each of their children. Does Michael think his father was a paedophile? \u201cThey were young brides, but he was not breaking the law. The rock singer Jerry Lee Lewis married a girl of 13 and he got into trouble. My father didn\u2019t get into trouble because she was a bit older, I suppose. I don\u2019t want to defend my father, but I don\u2019t think he was ever someone to use women purely sexually. He fell in love with a lot of young ladies, but he wasn\u2019t forcing them to have sex.\u201d Back in London, Michael won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, but he didn\u2019t finish the course. His fellow students had \u201call read Shakespeare. They were keen, ambitious. And I was smoking marijuana and having a good time. I had no talent for acting.\u201d Was he disappointed? \u201cNo, I was in full swinging 60s mode. I was reading Burroughs and was into the counterculture.\u201d After the story of his failure to marry Johns in Barcelona became front-page news, the pair got married in England, which also made headlines. When it was discovered that he and Johns, who by now had a baby son, were claiming benefits, they were all over the newspapers again. It\u2019s strange that was considered news, I say \u2013 you\u2019re hardly the first people to have claimed benefits. \u201cYes, but not the son of a millionaire.\u201d How did his father feel about it? \u201cWe never spoke about it. I\u2019m sure he was absolutely furious.\u201d On 5 April 1965, the front page of the Daily Telegraph ran with the headline: \u201cMy son should work, says Oona Chaplin\u201d beneath a photograph of a bearded Michael. A couple of days later, Michael was back in the news again after signing a record deal. Was he a good pop singer? He looks sheepish, and tells me he released a single called I Am What I Am. \u201cTo be honest with you, I hadn\u2019t written the song. I needed some money at the time, and I let these people tell me what to do and they released the record. It didn\u2019t go anywhere in the charts, and didn\u2019t deserve to.\u201d His most memorable newspaper appearance came in 1966, after he published a memoir at 19 with the fabulous title I Couldn\u2019t Smoke the Grass on My Father\u2019s Lawn. Even better, he then went to court to try to stop his own book being published \u2013 and failed. It had been written by two ghost writers and was rammed with potentially libellous material. How did the family feel about it? \u201cMy father was very angry because I wasn\u2019t too kind to him and some of his friends \u2026 Again we didn\u2019t talk for a long time after it.\u201d What had he said about Charlie? \u201cIt stereotyped him a bit.\u201d How? \u201cDiscontented, never happy.\u201d Was that image unfair? \u201cYes, absolutely. You can say it on the surface. But you see where he came from and how he had to fight to get where he was. And he had deep relationships with HG Wells, Bernard Shaw, Winston Churchill. He and Einstein would go out in Hollywood and have fun.\u201d Around this time, Charlie was making a film with Marlon Brando called A Countess from Hong Kong. Brando later called Charlie \u201cfearsomely cruel\u201d, \u201can egotistical tyrant\u201d and \u201cthe most sadistic man I\u2019d ever met\u201d. It was inevitable that they\u2019d fall out, Michael says. \u201cI thought: \u2018How can they work together? They\u2019re just complete opposites.\u2019\u201d While Brando liked to do his own thing, Charlie insisted on choreographing every move. Michael was banned from the set because Charlie still wasn\u2019t talking to him. \u201cHe thought I wasn\u2019t doing anything; wasting away. And he was right.\u201d Despite this, he says, he ended up working on the film without his father\u2019s knowledge after the producer, an old family friend, gave him a job. \u201cI was sorting out photographs of young actresses and running errands.\u201d Did he get a credit? He laughs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a job that merited a credit, but I got to meet Brando. He invited me to supper one night in his house.\u201d He does a mumbling Brando impersonation. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018I\u2019ve seen you and your father,\u2019 and he pointed his finger at me.\u201d What did he mean by that? \u201cBrando could read people, and he saw I was keeping a protective distance when dealing with my father, because he was quite explosive. He could relate to it. I suppose he liked me because he was also having problems dealing with him.\u201d Michael\u2019s marriage to Johns ended when he was 20. He met Betaudier Chaplin the following year, and they have been together ever since. In 1978 they retreated to south-west France to bring up their children (who include the actors Carmen and Dolores Chaplin) on a farm. Was he a good farmer? He shakes his head. \u201cWe only had six acres and 30 goats. The farmers\u2019 union accepted me because they needed farmers. Occasionally, they came at 8am when we were all asleep in bed to see if we were doing anything.\u201d He produced a bit of milk, but not enough to live on. But they had a \u201cvery nice subsidy\u201d. The whole region was being abandoned. \u201cThere was no industry there, the schools were emptying and there was a lower population in the region than in the middle ages.\u201d So what attracted him? The landscape, he says. \u201cI love that place. We were right in the heart of the Crusades against Cathars and you can feel a real melancholy there.\u201d The Cathars were a 12th- and 13th-century sect that preached an austere form of Christianity and believed the world was created by an evil force. They were regarded as heretics by the Catholic church and were burned at the stake on huge pyres. The slaughter of the Cathars eventually became the backdrop for A Fallen God. * * * It was on the goat farm, where they spent 13 years, that Michael began to be undone by his lack of ambition. The way he talks about it, he almost stopped being a player in his own life, feeling that whatever he achieved, he knew he couldn\u2019t compete with his father, or match his father\u2019s hopes for him. \u201cI was going nowhere, and everything was falling apart in the family we created. Our marriage was going through a hard time. My wife is much more dynamic and she doesn\u2019t mince her words. I despaired about my life and what it had become. It was a hard moment, but it gave me something to write about. I\u2019m very grateful \u2026\u201d It took him two decades to complete the book but his malaise provided the inspiration for King Mark in the novel. And, in turn, King Mark became a means of addressing that malaise. \u201cI wanted it to be about how you can bring yourself out of a state of despair. If you can accept it on a mythical level, then it can lift you out\u201d I ask if he ever reconciled with his father. Not fully, he says. But there are positive memories from later years. He tells me of the time Charlie discovered that he had Roma blood, and how proud both of them were. One of the few things they shared was a love of Gypsy culture. Then there was a time he took his father to a cafe he\u2019d discovered behind Victoria station in London that served jellied eels and mash. \u201cHe was really enjoying it.\u201d But then Charlie soured the occasion. \u201cI think he thought he was being too good to me so he looked at me and tapped me on the shoulder and said: \u2018You know your sister Geraldine is a great actress.\u2019\u201d He laughs \u2013 this time wistfully. \u201cJust to let me know!\u201d Perhaps his happiest memory is an occasion when he feels Charlie came closest to acceptance of, or even respect for, him. Charlie was in his 80s, and retreating further and further into himself. \u201cWe went to a very expensive restaurant in Paris when he could still talk just a little. I was talking about Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance [Robert M Pirsig\u2019s fictionalised autobiography] and explaining it to my mother, and he looked at me and said: \u2018You\u2019re a mystic.\u2019 I felt very touched.\u201d He looks on the verge of tears. After his father\u2019s death, Michael began to reassess their relationship. Perhaps Charlie had only wanted to toughen him up for the world \u2013 his greatest fear was that his children would experience the hardship he had as a child. Michael also became more critical of himself. \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t a good son. I ran away from home. I embarrassed him \u2026\u201d He trails off. Soon after his mother died in 1991, Michael and his brother Eugene and their families moved into their parents\u2019 Swiss mansion. They lived there for 10 years before it was turned into a museum, Chaplin\u2019s World, which finally opened in 2016. Was this a way of preserving their father\u2019s legacy? \u201cTo be honest, a house that size just swallows money, and we were going bankrupt. But when we were there, so many people would come knocking at the door from all around the world, so we got the idea of a museum. And it\u2019s a very good museum.\u201d Today, Michael feels at peace \u2013 with his father, and himself. He knows that many of his loved ones doubted that he would finish his book. \u201cIt became a kind of joke,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s writing his book.\u2019 But I knew I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to not finish it.\u201d Is he working on another one? He smiles. \u201cThis took 20 years. I don\u2019t think I have 20 years left for another, but who knows?\u201d He says his mother would be thrilled that he\u2019s finally a published novelist. As for his father, he doesn\u2019t like to presume to speak on Charlie\u2019s behalf, so he tells me a story instead. \u201cThere was a coming together with my father, but it happened after his death. That\u2019s why they say you count the years of your life from the moment of your father\u2019s death. I started having powerful dreams where I confronted him and we talked together. It was when I went back to Switzerland and the family house. He\u2019d stopped at that point being an obstacle and was opening the doors for me to live.\u201d He tells me of one particular dream about the Christmas card the Chaplins used to send out every year featuring a family photo. \u201cFor a long time, I was out of that Christmas card because I was abroad. When I came back, I was still not put back in that family photo. I wasn\u2019t happy about not being in that picture, nor was my wife. Then I had a dream about meeting my father under this huge Lebanese pine tree in front of the house. He walked me into the living room, opened up the cupboard and he gave me that photograph, but now me and the whole family were in the card. Then I woke up.\u201d The dream gave him a sense of closure, he says. \u201cI think he was telling me, wherever he is, that he\u2019s not excluding me from his life.\u201d \u2022 A Fallen God by Michael J Chaplin is published on 28 January by the Book Guild.

Rather than privatising public landholdings at a fraction of their value, as undertaken by Margaret Thatcher, much of the land in Vienna is held under public ownership or by cooperatives, reducing the inflationary pressures of speculators and making housing affordable and attractive in socially mixed communities. A start could be made by taxing land at its existing or approved land value; this would put developers in the UK under pressure to deliver housing for which they have planning permission, helping to meet increasing needs. Promoting communal landholdings and requiring that at least 35% of all new housing is genuinely affordable would improve social diversity, while increasing the number of council tax bands would enhance the revenues of local authorities and finance environmental improvements and public facilities.

It opens on a moment of weakness, as he describes his lowest point: the day he told his wife that he\u2019d fathered a baby with their housekeeper. \u201cNo failure has ever felt worse than that,\u201d he writes. But that isn\u2019t the interesting part. \u201cI won\u2019t be rehashing that story here,\u201d he sniffs, refusing to dwell on it for even a sentence longer. Instead, he instructs readers to Google the story if that\u2019s the sort of gossip that happens to get them going. The rest of the book continues at the same sort of clip, with Schwarzenegger wresting away any looming hint of introspection that might impinge on yet another anecdote about the time he cut the legs off his trousers to remind himself to work on his calves. I have to confess to tumbling down a bit of an Arnie\u2011hole after reading Be Useful, seeking out all sorts of interviews with him, purely to see if he has ever managed to display any vulnerability in public. The closest I got was an interview with Howard Stern, ostensibly to promote the forgotten 2015 film Terminator Genisys. At one point Schwarzenegger admitted that he had once attended couples therapy with his then wife. But, just like in the book, he clammed shut when asked if he got anything out of it. \u201cIt was the biggest mistake I\u2019ve ever made because that guy was so full of shit,\u201d he said. He claimed the sessions were full of \u201cnonsense talk\u201d that was \u201ccounterproductive to our future relationship\u201d. So why did he go? Because his wife talked him into it, apparently. It has the making of a million memes: \u201cMen would rather become an indestructible robot and eradicate humanity than go to therapy.\u201d The thing is, though, his book, and his life, make a seductive argument for just marching ahead unexamined \u2013 although whether his ex-wife would agree is a different matter. To Schwarzenegger, a moment spent exploring his inner motivations is a moment where he isn\u2019t able to manifest his external ones, whether that\u2019s becoming, briefly, the world\u2019s highest-paid actor, successfully entering politics or Instagramming videos of the donkey he lets roam around his kitchen. It seems like a good life. But it doesn\u2019t seem particularly fair of him. A big part of couples therapy, maybe even the biggest, is finding a space where you can learn to communicate properly again. And that\u2019s bound to be difficult when one half of the couple a) doesn\u2019t want to do it in the first place and b) is determined not to get anything out of it. Counsellor Priya Tourkow has a number of theories about why people might not want to take the plunge. \u201cThey think the therapist is going to sit there and not say anything. Or they\u2019re worried that the therapist will be on their partner\u2019s side. There can be a real fear of opening Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d That fear might be exacerbated if you\u2019d happened to catch Showtime\u2019s Couples Therapy, currently on iPlayer \u2013 a series that seems to exist as a warning for people who aren\u2019t in couples therapy not to have couples therapy. Admittedly, it might be a bad example from which to extrapolate, because the programme isn\u2019t just about couples having therapy, but about couples who actively want their sessions to be broadcast on television; an impulse that, you suspect, can\u2019t be all that good for a relationship. But even accounting for this, Couples Therapy isn\u2019t a particularly good advert. It\u2019s the sort of show that forces you to take sides. It\u2019s Jeremy Kyle with better dentistry. Thankfully, this isn\u2019t what most couples therapy is in reality. It isn\u2019t a competition where you pay someone to pick a winner, where there\u2019s a hero we can root for, and a villain to despise. And this, I would guess, is why Schwarzenegger didn\u2019t enjoy his session. \u201cCouples therapy is based on the premise that having the best relationship you can have is a good idea,\u201d argues Tourkow. If that\u2019s not how you see it, then it may well be a waste of time. Even with the best will in the world, however, it\u2019s still going to be hard, \u201cbecause there are habits that build, and we\u2019re all going to get triggered \u2026 One of the things that happens in couples therapy is that you learn to talk to each other. How much more foundational does it get than that?\u201d I should probably come clean and point out that I know Priya quite well. My wife and I started having sessions with her almost as a joke \u2013 a newspaper asked us to have couples therapy and write about it \u2013 only for us to instantly realise that, oh shit, we might actually need couples therapy. It wasn\u2019t fun, because of course it wasn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t easy to hear all the ways that you\u2019re not perfect, and the sessions never end when the session ends, because you invariably have to travel home together afterwards in the immediate aftermath of some horrible home truths. But it did help. We learned techniques to cool things down in tetchy moments that would have otherwise rocketed off into the stratosphere. We actually apologise to each other sometimes now. Imagine. This isn\u2019t a blanket endorsement. For some, perhaps especially the overthinkers among us, certain forms of therapy might get you more bogged down, rather than freeing you up. Ester Perel, the closest the therapy world has to a superstar thanks to her wildly popular podcast, warns: \u201cIronically, we often are inclined to seek the form of therapy that matches our defences rather than help us change it.\u201d Not only that, but \u201cfor many people, therapy is still filled with stigma and talking to a stranger is a bizarre practice\u201d. Bizarre it may be, and judging from his book and his social media, things are going great for Schwarzenegger. But it does seem quite odd that someone who has made a career out of working hard and battling through adversity couldn\u2019t face the prospect of sitting in a room with his wife and talking about his problems. That said, it\u2019s not unknown for couples who resisted therapy at first to return once they\u2019ve exhausted other options. With any luck, he\u2019ll be back.

The city\u2019s parks and morning markets filled with people enjoying the unseasonable warmth, and the smell of the city\u2019s inexplicably expensive coffees drifted through the laneways as scooters buzzed through the crowds of pedestrians and bicycles. Twelve hours earlier an election watched by the world, framed as a choice between \u201cwar and peace\u201d or \u201cdemocracy and authoritarianism\u201d with existential implications for the global order, came to an end. A winner was declared, a loser conceded, voters were either overjoyed or disappointed. China \u2013 the aggressor party in this situation \u2013 was predictably cranky. But that was it. For some of the many Americans here, watching this presidential vote, 10 months ahead of their own, was inspiring but also a little painful. The global superpower which for so long has heralded itself as the leader of the democratic world is no longer the best example of it. For Taiwan\u2019s 23.5 million people at the weekend, they proudly held that title. The campaign was a boisterous, hyperpartisan, chaotic affair that inspired almost 72% of eligible voters to show up at the polls. Many of them also returned at the end of the day to watch the count, an extraordinarily transparent and analogue process involving volunteers holding each paper ballot up and shouting the voter\u2019s choice to another worker who marked it down \u2013 in pencil \u2013 on an A3 sheet stuck to the wall with sticky tape. Thousands of others gathered outside party headquarters to hear the seats called in real time. In Taipei it was hard to push through the heaving Democratic Progress party (DPP) crowd. Confetti rained down as it was announced that Lai Ching-te and his running mate Hsiao Bi-khim had won. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) event in New Taipei city was sad from the start. Rows and rows of empty red stools, a small national flag hopefully placed on each one, sat empty. Journalists paced the ground, outnumbering the interviewees they were searching for. Voters returned the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to presidential power but took away their majority in the legislature. A new third party, the Taiwan People\u2019s party (TPP), split the opposition vote but also inspired a surge of idealistic youth to join its ranks. For many voters, regardless of stripe, the biggest takeaway from the election is pride in the system itself. The small democracy won plaudits internationally its robust and transparent vote, despite efforts from China to influence the outcome and in marked contrast to Taiwan\u2019s recent history of authoritarian rule. Saturday\u2019s vote was only the eighth time that Taiwanese citizens have chosen their own president in free elections. The KMT\u2019s candidate, Hou You-yi, was praised for his swift concession on election night. He told a small crowd of disappointed supporters that he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for failing to win. \u201cI respect the final choice of the voters. This is a democratic election, which means that the voters decide the election\u2019s outcome. We need to face the voters and listen to them,\u201d Hou said. Some had backed him primarily because they thought it important that Taiwan\u2019s government undergo a change in leadership. \u201cIt should be considered natural; every four years we should switch to a better government,\u201d says Jerry Peng, who voted for Hou. But \u201cI still want to congratulate the DPP, because they won some of the hearts in Taiwan. I hope that they can continue to do the right thing.\u201d Such a sentiment would have been impossible in his father\u2019s generation. Across the political rallies, attendees shared their strong political opinions, but also encouraged the Guardian to speak to as many people as we could to get all perspectives. \u201cIt has not been easy for us to get to where we are now,\u201d 83-year-old Mr Song says at a pre-election rally, detailing the brutal history of Taiwan\u2019s authoritarian era. \u201cWe people work hard together. We have deep freedom. It is a holy land for freedom, Taiwan is very free.\u201d Government of many colours Now the dust has settled, the hangovers have faded and the confetti has been cleared, political observers are mulling the implications. In his acceptance speech Lai said the DPP had \u201cnot worked hard enough\u201d to get a majority, and that Taiwan\u2019s people \u201cexpect an effective government as well as strong checks and balances\u201d. He declared he would study the policies and positions of his opponents and that they would be incorporated \u201cas long as they bring benefit to the people\u201d. He said he would appoint cross-party members to official roles. There are concerns the new DPP administration is going to struggle to push its policy agenda through the parliament. It had campaigned on a platform largely centred on defending Taiwan from China\u2019s annexation threats, but domestically, the third-placed TPP \u201chold the pivotal place in the parliament,\u201d says Nathan Batto, associate research fellow at Academia Sinica and author of the Frozen Garlic Taiwan political blog. \u201cThey will have power. They\u2019re more likely to side with the KMT because their whole discourse is being an opposition party.\u201d Trouble in east Asia\u2019s oldest party? For the KMT, having failed to secure more than 40% of the vote in three successive elections, some are wondering if east Asia\u2019s oldest party could be in terminal decline. However, Batto says deep introspection in the party is unlikely. \u201cThe KMT internal politics is dominated by the hardcore Chinese nationalist wing of the party. The party members who vote in party elections and make the party decisions are heavily skewed towards the old military families with strong Chinese nationalist tendencies. That makes it very hard to reform or move away from old positions within the party.\u201d Part of Lai\u2019s victory can be attributed to the lack of a credible opposition. The KMT won seats in the legislature, but the fact that the DPP, which is defined by its pro-sovereignty stance, has won an unprecedented three terms in office suggests that the KMT\u2019s position on Taiwan\u2019s cultural and economic links with China is out of kilter with public opinion. Alexander Huang, the director of international relations for the KMT, disagrees. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe that we [the KMT] have a Taiwan identity problem right now. I really don\u2019t think so. Because everyone is Taiwanese. I was born and raised here.\u201d The problem, says Huang, is that the KMT failed to explain clearly to Taiwanese voters the nuances of their position, something that is \u201cvery hard to translate into campaign slogans\u201d.", "date": "2024-01-16", "section": "World news", "author": "Helen Davidson and Amy Hawkins in Taipei", "id": 546, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ab4b896e8b029984df653b25d7f69d6fb27029b4/0_67_5318_3192/500.jpg"}, {"title": "My partner\u2019s lazy son is ruining our sex life", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/16/my-partners-lazy-son-is-ruining-our-sex-life", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.115, "neu": 0.586, "pos": 0.298, "compound": 0.9892}, "body": "For the most part, my partner and I have a great and loving relationship.

Morpurgo and a coalition of leading authors, including Julia Donaldson, Malorie Blackman and Cressida Cowell, are backing a call by BookTrust to ensure that every child from a low-income family has access to books and reading activities by investing in a programme across schools and nurseries. \u201cWe have to acknowledge the right of every single child in this country to have access, physically, intellectually and emotionally, to reading. And that will not happen unless the books are there, and it will not happen unless books are shared early,\u201d said Morpurgo, the author of well-loved classics such as War Horse and The Butterfly Lion. Morpurgo said the UK had a \u201cdivision of opportunity\u201d between children with access to books, whose lives and education were \u201cmassively enriched\u201d as a result, and those from deprived backgrounds that did not. \u201cAny government that doesn\u2019t recognise this is simply blind,\u201d said Morpurgo. \u201cWe do have a hugely divided society, particularly at the moment when we have so many millions living in poverty, and these are the very children who are exposed to this lack of commitment to passing on what is arguably the greatest asset we have in this country, our literature from this remarkable language we have got. \u201cThese are also the most likely children to be suffering from mental health issues, from lack of self-worth and from family problems at home. These are the very children who most need to find the pathway to fulfilment and achievement that books can bring.\u201d Research by BookTrust has found that only half of children aged between one and two from low-income families are read to every day. Morpurgo is one of the 12 past and present children\u2019s laureates who have signed the BookTrust\u2019s letter to Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, as well as to the first ministers and opposition leaders in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Library closures by local authorities were particularly likely to affect disadvantaged families, according to Morpurgo, by closing off a vital source of access to books. \u201cWe should never, ever, in this country close down a library again,\u201d he said. \u201cI live in the middle of Devon, where the nearest library is a long way away, we\u2019re talking about a 35-minute drive if you have a car and a lot of people haven\u2019t. There\u2019s no local bookshop, even if you had the money. The library is the last lifeline to reading.\u201d Morpurgo also called for government to allow schools more time to encourage reading for pleasure, rather than as tools for passing exams. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have got to get away from, the idea that English literature and books are just something to study. They\u2019re not. They are there to enjoy and become part of your life, not just to be studied and quizzed on,\u201d Morpurgo said. \u201cThat is where governments can help. In schools, teachers complain all the time that there is no room in the curriculum, there\u2019s no room for just sitting and telling and reading a story. \u201cWhen I go to schools, time and time again teachers say it\u2019s so important but there isn\u2019t time.

A report by MPs on the public accounts committee said the EA had failed to meet a target of maintaining 98% of \u201chigh consequence\u201d flood defences. The agency has had to downgrade the number of properties it aims to protect by 2027 from 336,000 to 200,000. New houses were being built on floodplains without checks being carried out to make sure suitable flood defences had been put in place, the MPs said. They described the failure as \u201cunforgivable\u201d. Some 5.7 million properties were at risk of flooding in England in 2022 and 2023 and this number is expected to increase as climate breakdown brings more intense downpours more often. Flooding across the UK earlier this month damaged nearly 2,000 properties. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, deputy chair of the Commons committee, said robust flood resilience must become a priority. \u201cThe depredations caused by such disasters are a matter of life and death for communities up and down the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis inquiry has uncovered the alarming truth that in a number of ways, the approach to keeping our citizens safe in this area is contradictory and self-defeating, not least in the continuing development of new housing in areas of high flood risk without appropriate mitigations.\u201d The committee said the government should set a measure of how many properties were protected from flooding that took into account the number with poor defences, as well as new constructions. It should also ensure that smaller projects found it easier to get approval so that rural villages had the same right to protection as others, they said. Clifton-Brown said: \u201cThe number of properties at risk of flooding from deteriorating defences eclipsing those benefiting from new ones is another case in point. This is emblematic both of the government\u2019s failure to strike the right balance between maintenance and construction, and of not considering the net number of properties at risk. \u201cOne of the first steps in delivering any successful policy is clearly defining what success looks like.

The Conservatives must get a grip and give communities like mine the support we deserve.\u201d The government has said its aim was to create \u201ca nation more resilient to future flood and coastal erosion risk\u201d, but the report found there was no numerical target in place, meaning it could not quantify how much progress was being made on this.", "date": "2024-01-17", "section": "Environment", "author": "Sandra Laville and agencies", "id": 549, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/805612f4a415eec281b502fafa7634e79be6cbee/0_16_4000_2400/500.jpg"}, {"title": "The fishy flavour of lapsang souchong | Brief letters", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/17/the-fishy-flavour-of-lapsang-souchong", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.027, "neu": 0.744, "pos": 0.229, "compound": 0.9907}, "body": "Regarding lapsang souchong (Adrian Chiles, 11 January), I still chuckle at the memory of when an elderly friend quickly rinsed a cup in the bowl of water used to wash up after the previous night\u2019s supper of mackerel to give the visiting doctor a cup of tea. \u201cAh, the distinctive smoky aroma of lapsang souchong!\u201d he said happily as he drank the builder\u2019s tea she poured for him.

He succeeds Looney, who stepped down after failing to disclose to the board personal relationships with colleagues. The appointment brings to an end a \u201crobust and competitive search process\u201d that many believed would lead to the oil supermajor\u2019s first external chief executive hire in its history. Auchincloss, a 53-year-old Canadian national, joined BP when it took over the oil company Amoco in 1998 and has been on the board since he became chief financial officer four years ago. In his new role he will take home an annual salary of \u00a31.45m before pension and bonus opportunities. He reportedly competed for the role against Carol Howle, BP\u2019s head of trading and shipping, and Emma Delaney, the head of customers and products. The chief executive of BAE Systems, Charles Woodburn, was also reportedly linked to the role. Helge Lund, the BP chair, said: \u201cSince September, BP\u2019s board has undertaken a thorough and highly competitive process to identify BP\u2019s next CEO, considering a number of high-calibre candidates in detail. The board is in complete agreement that Murray was the outstanding candidate and is the right leader for BP. \u201cMany already know Murray well, and few know BP better than he does. His assured leadership, focus on performance and delivery, and deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the energy transition will serve BP well as we continue our disciplined transformation to an integrated energy company.\u201d Auchincloss said: \u201cOur strategy \u2013 from international oil company to integrated energy company, or IOC to IEC \u2013 does not change. I\u2019m convinced about the significant value we can create. \u201cNow, more than ever, our focus must remain on delivery \u2013 operating safely and efficiently, executing with discipline, and always focusing on returns.

Does Manon, a ballet about prostitution and sexual violence, come dangerously close to misery porn? In the lower rungs of 18th-century Paris, women are bought and abused, the society on show is an ugly one, but this is ballet so it\u2019s also beautiful: I think that\u2019s called cognitive dissonance. Manon is full of dislikable characters, and its success hinges on whether the dancers can engross us in their journey. Opening night features two of the Royal Ballet\u2019s strongest actors, Francesca Hayward and Gary Avis, as well as Marcelino Samb\u00e9 making his debut as pure-hearted Des Grieux, so the answer is yes. The real theme is power. There\u2019s the guileless power of youthful femininity that Manon (Hayward) doesn\u2019t even realise she has, radiating goodness and beauty that others want to leech. There\u2019s the power that comes with money, obviously. Monsieur GM (Avis) is the kind of guy who likes to throw a handful of coins on the floor and laugh as desperate souls scramble for them. But how the balance subtly tips when he shows his interest in Manon and suddenly he wants her too much (Avis is excellent at being creepy, rubbing his face against her satin shoe). She\u2019s frozen with confusion and discomfort but quickly realises her currency. In a clever pas de trois she is pimped by her own brother (Alexander Campbell, very good) who lifts her legs in arabesques over Monsieur GM\u2019s head and the question of who is in control is ever changing. Later, lavishly dressed, Hayward carries herself like a queen, but Manon\u2019s power is an illusion and we see just how far she falls. Whatever your feeling about the content, the craft is consummate: MacMillan\u2019s pas de deux packed with inventive, unexpected steps and lifts; the insatiability of young love captured in sweeping phrases that don\u2019t stop to breathe.

I was still trying to find my way and discover what I was passionate about.\u201d During the summer after freshman year, she was invited to a get-together at the local swimming pool. \u201cWhen I arrived, I saw Averie.

After a few hours at the pool, they spent the rest of the day together. \u201cI loved how easy-going she was and after that we started hanging out all the time,\u201d says Averie. As well as seeing each other at school, the pair enjoyed making mixed CDs together and both had their first jobs at the same ice-cream parlour. \u201cWe could drive at 14 with a permit, so we spent lots of time driving around together listening to music, which is the most midwest thing you can do,\u201d laughs MaryKat. \u201cWe also went to all our dances together, as well as teenage parties in cornfields.\u201d When they were 16, MaryKat\u2019s mother lost her job and the family relocated to South Carolina. \u201cI was able to stay with my cousin and complete high school,\u201d says MaryKat. \u201cAverie was there for me the whole time and I could always lean on her. When I was feeling lonely and missing my family, she looked out for me. My independence is now a major part of my personality and she helped me to develop that.\u201d After school, the pair went to different colleges, with MaryKat moving to South Carolina to study visual communications and German, and Averie attending university in Kansas to study business and French. When they graduated, Averie moved to New York to work in fashion merchandising while MaryKat travelled the world, working in communications for non-profit organisations. \u201cDuring the pandemic, we lived together for two years in New York,\u201d says Averie. While MaryKat has now returned to travelling around Europe with a refugee organisation, Averie has remained in New York and the pair don\u2019t go a day without talking. \u201cWe have also taken lots of trips together \u2013 she makes amazing itineraries,\u201d says MaryKat. \u201cI love skiing and hiking, while Averie likes the beach, but we always find a way to compromise.\u201d In recent years, they\u2019ve been to Denver, San Diego, Paris and London, and they\u2019re hoping to visit Croatia soon, too. They even enjoy the downsides of travelling together. \u201cWhen we went to London at new year, we couldn\u2019t get a taxi and ended up walking barefoot in the cold for an hour because our shoes hurt so much,\u201d says Averie. \u201cWith anyone else it would have been horrible but she makes these experiences fun.\u201d Averie also appreciates her friend\u2019s caring nature. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to MaryKat that her work helps people and that\u2019s a really admirable trait,\u201d she says. \u201cShe makes everyone feel comfortable and at ease.\u201d For MaryKat, opposites definitely attract. \u201cShe\u2019s into fashion; I\u2019m very much not and she has to help me figure out what to wear. She loves hot weather; I love being in cold climates. But we share the same political values and loyalty is really important to us,\u201d she says. \u201cAverie gives people the best advice and she\u2019s really good at being objective.

It\u2019s the name: both funny and audacious (is an insidious joy industry manipulating us into bliss?). Who\u2019s considering even medium-sized joy, when the horror of world events unfolds around us hourly? But finding joy in hard times, personal or global, is precisely the point of Big JOY, a citizen science project based at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Anyone can take part \u2013 it requires a time commitment of just seven minutes a day for seven days, with easy activities that studies suggest are likely to increase positive emotions. The premise is that we can work out what makes us feel good and do more of it. \u201cMicro-acts of joy focus us on what is good about the life in front of us, and how we can make it better,\u201d says Elissa Epel, a psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Francisco and author of The Seven-Day Stress Prescription, who is a collaborator on the Big JOY project. \u201cThis is critical during these dark times; these are ways we bring in the light.\u201d More than 88,000 people in 208 countries have tried Big JOY since it launched in November 2021 \u2013 and that number now includes me. I\u2019m not naturally overflowing with joy; no one has ever mistaken me for a ray of sunshine. But I turn 50 this year and learning to squeeze more joy from life feels increasingly urgent. I\u2019m not optimistic (obviously) that a week of \u201cmicro-acts\u201d is the answer, but I\u2019m ready to give Big JOY a chance. Day 0: Getting started Once I\u2019ve signed up, my week kicks off with an exhortation to listen to a recording of people laughing. I don\u2019t enjoy this: it feels overblown and fake like a sitcom laugh track. What the hell do you all have to laugh about (yes, even you, the baby at the end)? I also complete a questionnaire that goes alarmingly deep, asking me to assess whether I am \u201csatisfied with my life as a whole\u201d, whether I\u2019ve felt \u201ccontent with my relationships and friendships\u201d this week and how much common humanity I feel with others. Yikes. I understand it\u2019s about working out a baseline, though, and I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s to come. Day 1: Celebrate another\u2019s joy A Big JOY email delivers my first challenge. Choose a person, or people, in my life and \u201cplan to ask this person to tell you about something fun, wonderful or inspiring that they\u2019ve experienced, or that has made them feel proud recently\u201d. I try it at choir. Helen tells me about holding her brand-new first granddaughter in her arms in December; Cristina observed a goldcrest sitting on a bare branch; and Anna says she felt joy when we started singing a Welsh folk song. \u201cThere\u2019s something quite special and rare about a group of people coming together to make music,\u201d she reminds me. It\u2019s touching how openly and sincerely my choir mates engage with the exercise and I love hearing what has made them joyful. Big JOY suggests I nod, smile and say stuff like: \u201cThat must have felt great!\u201d but I am not American, so I don\u2019t; my smile is absolutely real though. Full disclosure: I also find myself telling a sad anecdote about a dead goldcrest, which absolutely no one needed to hear. When prompted to do my late-night check-in \u2013 Big JOY asks you to rate your mood straight after the mission and again at the end of the day \u2013 I\u2019m on a high. I rate this as something I\u2019d like to do again and I do: I start asking my friends whenever I can. I learn about the fun and wonder they\u2019ve got, variously, from singing to a cat, a fulfilling new job, \u201choliday sex with a Canadian oncologist\u201d (\u201cThat must have felt great!\u201d I consider and reject saying) and a Sesame Street documentary. Day 2: You are a force of good The demonstrably incorrect title of day 2 makes me frown when it appears in my inbox. Before I can explore further, however, I complete my morning check-in. The questions are the same morning and night: to what extent I\u2019m feeling \u201cpleasant emotions like delight, pride or hope\u201d and then separately how much I\u2019m feeling \u201cunpleasant emotions like distress, sadness or anger\u201d. It\u2019s hard but interesting, splitting my emotions into positive and negative rather than just a muddy wash of anxiety-tinged blah-ness. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful for our own self-knowledge and also for the scientific study that we become aware of all our feelings,\u201d the Big JOY Q&amp;A explains. The task is to listen to a Buddhist prayer \u2013 apparently one of the Dalai Lama\u2019s faves \u2013 reciting along if you wish. There is a sort-of spiritual context to Big JOY; the original idea came from Mission: Joy, a documentary featuring the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu, about finding joy in troubled times. The prayer is performed by Sah D\u2019Simone, bestselling author of Spiritually Sassy, dance healer and guru for Channel 4\u2019s Big Celebrity Detox. (Yes, I go down a deep Google hole on the amazing-sounding D\u2019Simone to put off listening.) I recite along although I\u2019m deeply sceptical. The prayer suggests that \u201cby virtue of my merits\u201d amazing things will happen in the world, the blind will see, the poor find wealth and the thirsty find \u201cdelicious drinks\u201d. It feels silly. But when I reach the last section about remaining to \u201cdispel the miseries of the world\u201d, I find myself crying. How can I be a \u201cforce of good\u201d? I feel utterly powerless. Day 3: Shift your perspective Today I have to think of a time recently I felt \u201cfrustrated, anxious or upset\u201d (it would be harder to think of a time I\u2019m not), then \u201ctake a deep, slow breath\u201d and write three positive things that came out of it. It takes me a while to settle on something: I can\u2019t see an upside to being impersonated by online scammers, getting ringworm or becoming frighteningly incapacitated with anxiety over the summer, so I decide to focus on my dog\u2019s death (at which point, I confess I\u2019m questioning when the joy bit starts). I take my deep breath and remember how close I felt to my husband as he cried next to me. I remember how writing about the experience connected me to people who had been through similar things. Then I think how often I still mention losing Oscar to strangers, months later. Just this week I had a surprisingly long and deep conversation in Waterstones with a woman and her sausage dog about grief (mainly the woman \u2013 the sausage dog was trying to eat a plush avocado). There\u2019s something about the universality of loss that makes it a powerful force for connection, I suppose. Cheery. Day 4: Make a gratitude list Ah, this old chestnut. It\u2019s on here for good reasons, I know. \u201cStudies show that exercising gratitude can lead to more optimism about life, increased physical comfort and better health, quicker recovery from stressful and upsetting events, higher quantity and quality of friendships,\u201d Big JOY explains. A meta-review of 70 studies of gratitude research in 2021 concluded that \u201cindividuals who experience more gratitude have lower levels of depression\u201d. I have never tried, so I give it a sincere go. I\u2019m grateful for my home and the deep peace it affords me. I\u2019m grateful for my affectionate and endlessly tolerant husband, a best friend who makes my life better every day, the opportunity to watch my sons become interesting adults and for the people I know who work in small ways to make the world around us better. Also my chickens. I\u2019m really grateful for chickens. Thankfully I don\u2019t have to rank which I\u2019m most grateful for. Day 5: Dwell in awe Awe can make us feel more connected and compassionate and can increase feelings of physical and mental wellbeing. Unfortunately, as I tackle this nature-based awe exercise \u2013 watching a video of Yosemite \u2013 a worrying work issue crops up that sends me spiralling. The footage is very beautiful, but it barely registers with my heart thudding and palms sweating. But dwelling in awe is one thing I know how to do, and it doesn\u2019t happen in front of my laptop. I go into the garden and sit quietly on the ground. A robin comes very close to observe me; long-tailed tits flit around the feeders; the light is beautiful. Suburban York is no Yosemite; but it takes me out of my own exhausting head and gives me a fraction more perspective on my work problems. Day 6: Tune in to what matters Today I am supposed to rate values \u2013 virtue, fairness, goodwill and unity \u2013 and explain how they \u201cinform and shape your day-to-day experiences\u201d. At this point I start feeling slightly mutinous: I thought I was signing up for seven days of joy-inducing challenges (cuddle a baby, stroke a puppy, eat a cake, splash in a puddle, that sort of thing); instead I\u2019m getting homework. I dutifully rate my values and spend some time feeling bad at how little I actually embody them. It\u2019s not sparking joy. \u201cA micro-act of JOY that doesn\u2019t result in JOY for you doesn\u2019t mean anything negative about YOU, you wonderful human,\u201d Big JOY says, reassuringly. As a reward for slogging through it, I go and do something that reliably brings me joy: playing with my hens. When I do my mood check-ins, I\u2019m struck at how often I find I am scoring myself above average on both positive and negative emotions, rather than all one way or the other. I\u2019m always anxious, but on closer examination, I\u2019m also contented. I think this gets to the kernel of what Big JOY is teaching: identifying or finding joy amid negative emotions and experiences. Day 7: Do something kind Doing something kind, my last challenge, feels manageable until I read the small print: I\u2019m supposed to identify five separate people and a kind thing to do for them. Who am I, Am\u00e9lie Poulain? I don\u2019t even see five people most days. On closer reading I don\u2019t have to do all the acts immediately; just think about them. OK: I will darn my husband\u2019s jumper that he keeps showing me, hopefully, and I keep ignoring. I will send a friend a care package, return a forgotten item to a colleague, give a compliment and drop some groceries at the food bank. I make a start, and the to-do-list-ticking aspect of trotting off to the post office and food bank feels good. However I also shame myself for not having enough social contact to make this task easy, and not doing small kindnesses spontaneously more often. The verdict Following a final check-in, I unlock my \u201cpersonalised joy report\u201d. Cheeringly, my wellbeing has gone up 14.13%. Predictably for me, that\u2019s lower than the average, based on the project\u2019s interim findings, which showed an increase of 23%. \u201cThis was a much larger effect than we expected,\u201d Epel says. \u201cWe found people increase in their positive emotions immediately and in feelings of flourishing by end of the week.\u201d It wasn\u2019t universal, however, she explains, and the next phase of the project will involve delving into the data to explore why. Participants are also volunteers, of course, so probably inclined to be receptive; there\u2019s a further study in the works that will test how Big JOY works in controlled conditions. The report also confirms what I felt: that what made me happiest were the tasks involving other people. Epel says her experience has been the same. \u201cThe prosocial interventions help me the most, and that\u2019s no surprise ... happiness research suggests that kind acts for others are a powerful way to increase the subtle but lasting feelings of happiness.\u201d So have I embiggened my joy over seven days? Good question. Big JOY wasn\u2019t the barrel of cartwheeling, kitten-kissing laughs I had hoped, but I think it\u2019s given me something deeper: a reminder of how happy other people (not just hens) make me, especially if I can make them feel good too. The conclusion seems to be that to feel more joy, I need to become a more connected, outward-looking person, ruminate less and focus on finding ways, however small, of doing good in the world. Hmm. I have a funny feeling that was Big JOY\u2019s dastardly plan all along. \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Does what it says on the tin but also clever and zeitgeist-y with a nice take on the pandemic \u2013 among its many horrors, it gave some people a chance to step off the hamster wheel and refocus on their relationships. I think this is an important part of the pandemic story but understandably gets lost among bigger, negative themes. Sittenfeld\u2019s back catalogue is also brilliant and in particular I recommend Rodham, which reimagines Hillary Clinton\u2019s life if she had ditched Bill early on. \u2013 Hepcat1 Dimension of Miracles by Robert Sheckley Penguin, $22.99 For fans of Douglas Adams I\u2019d recommend looking up the works of Robert Sheckley, starting with Dimension of Miracles. Written in 1968, this is a brilliant satire which still hits most of its targets today. Adams hadn\u2019t read any Sheckley before writing his own novels, but there are certainly similarities in tone, content and humour between the two. \u2013 nilpferd The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid by Bill Bryson Penguin, $24.99 I remember my raucous, unseemly and uncontrolled laughter when reading Bill Bryson\u2019s memoir about his childhood. Crying laughter. And this was on a plane and it was one of those \u201cwhat\u2019s he laughing about\u201d moments. This is his account of seeing an adult coming to grief after diving off a high board: He fell with flawless grace for what seemed whole minutes. Such was the beauty of the moment, and the breathless silence of the watching multitudes, that the only sound to be heard across the lake was the faint whistle of his body tearing through the air towards the water far, far below. It may only be my imagination, but he seemed after a time to start to glow red, like an incoming meteor. He was really moving. \u2013 NiallConnolly Would That Be Funny? by Lorin Clarke Text, $35 Not rolling-about funny but I found much to smile at when reading Lorin Clarke\u2019s 2023 memoir about her father, comedian John Clarke. For those who still smile at recalling episodes of Clarke and Dawe, this book is a charmer. \u2013 MJMI My Name is Barbra by Barbra Streisand Penguin, $75 Streisand is a one-of-a-kind talent who overcame a difficult childhood, a jealous, unsupportive mother and seemingly teams of men who tried to obstruct her vision and control her when she wouldn\u2019t succumb. When singing with a symphony orchestra, she heard a wrong note, questioned the music, was condescended to and ignored again. When they finally checked the score that note was found to be incorrectly transcribed. She broke through so many ceilings in the film industry. Amazing life. \u2013 tonimaccer The Book of Sand by Theo Clare Penguin, $22.99 The sadly late Mo Hayder (writing as Theo Clare) wrote this book set in an alternative universe, and is somewhere between fantasy, sci-fi and mystery. The world and its disparate family of occupants is beautifully realised and the novel completely intrigues. There are rumours that a second, posthumous novel, The Book of Clouds, is planned for release. \u2013 squidlet1 Shy by Mary Rodgers and Jesse Green Hachette, $55 The best celebrity memoir of recent times is Shy: The Alarmingly Outspoken Memoirs of Mary Rodgers. Composer of note from a family of composers: daughter of Richard Rodgers, mother to Adam Guettel, friend to Stephen Sondheim (among many others). Smart, gossipy, wonderfully self-deprecating and often laugh-out-loud hilarious. \u2013 ozjosh Bryant &amp; May series by Christopher Fowler Penguin, $22.99 I highly recommend the Bryant &amp; May novels by Christopher Fowler (who sadly died last year). The title characters are London\u2019s two oldest serving policemen, part of the Peculiar Crimes squad, tasked with investigating odd, unorthodox crimes. Extremely entertaining, often quite humorous (though at times grim \u2013 they\u2019re certainly not \u201ccozy\u201d mysteries) and always full of fascinating details about London and its history. Given how cool, wet and miserable this summer has been in my part of Australia, I feel right at home re-reading them! \u2013 Sockamagee Space by Stephen Baxter HarperCollins, $22.99 Space spans a period from present day until the year 8800 AD and beyond. The book starts with the discovery of aliens and, over the next 6,000 years, the Baxter explores first contact as well as the human colonisation of various moons and planets. The destruction then re-engineering of Earth\u2019s atmosphere is written about in great detail. I find that the detail that Baxter goes into extremely fascinating, believable and beautiful \u2013 like a chapter where a human explores Venus for the first time, describing how the rocks glow an eerily beautiful red and how moving on the surface is like wading through water. Breathtaking. \u2013 PAC1979 Case Histories by Kate Atkinson Penguin, $22.99 Atkinson\u2019s Jackson Brodie series is dark, funny and clever. You follow Brodie, a PI, as well as the trajectory of minor characters who become major players in the following books. Atkinson is a brilliant writer. Start with book one: Case Histories. \u2013 tonimaccer Mordant\u2019s Need series by Stephen Donaldson Hachette, $7.99 (ebook) Ah, fantasy. I enjoy it but find that sorcery, it seems, does not lend itself to brevity. In that spirit, may I recommend the mercifully brief and eminently readable Mordant\u2019s Need series by Stephen Donaldson. It spans a total of two books, features a heroine whose story arc extends beyond tired girl power tropes, and it has one of the best finales I\u2019ve read. \u2013 TheBaronVonTiki Harpo Speaks! by Harpo Marx Rowman &amp; Littlefield, US$27.99 Try this autobiography of Harpo Marx, co-written with Rowland Barber. You do not need to be a Marx brothers fan; in fact their movies barely get mentioned. It\u2019s the many famous people that he managed to meet and interact with that make this a truly memorable book. \u2013 woollcott Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The Professor by Lauren Nossett Macmillan, $12.99 The Professor is Nossett\u2019s sequel to her debut, The Resemblance. You can see the slight Donna Tartt/Tana French influence as former detective Marlitt Kaplan goes undercover to live with university students to clear a professor being investigated under a Title IX complaint about a student who died by suicide at a US university. It\u2019s tense as hell and my jaw dropped right up until the final line. \u2013 Sikonat My Life and Hard Times by James Thurber HarperCollins, US$14.99 I recently reread this one. Surprised and delighted that something which reduced me to tears of laughter as a teenager is just as funny half a century on. \u2013 Bibliobat Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erikson Penguin, $22.99 Fourteen-odd years ago my brother bought me two books for my birthday. As a lapsed fantasy fan, I was a little nonplussed, but I very quickly got into the first, which was a small, underground novel called Game of Thrones. You may have heard of it. It was the other book, though, that has stayed with me longer. Gardens of the Moon, the first of a 10-part series, is not an easy read and shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s first fantasy book. But the series as a whole is so vast and operatic I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it to anyone who feels they can take on 10 very, very big books. I\u2019m on a second read of the series now and it\u2019s really rewarded me. \u2013 grafhamboy Readers\u2019 comments have been edited for length and clarity", "date": "2024-01-18", "section": "Culture", "author": "Guardian readers", "id": 556, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e6c587cee6bea23cb6233db5780e237141214f57/0_0_2500_1500/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Akara, London SE1: \u2018This isn\u2019t stand-on-ceremony food, this is a dig-in type of dinner\u2019 \u2013 restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/19/akara-london-se1-restaurant-review-grace-dent", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.062, "neu": 0.725, "pos": 0.213, "compound": 0.9974}, "body": "On the edge of Borough Market, hiding slightly up a back lane and away from the \u00a312 aubergines, the pork chops that come with CVs and the madding foodie crowds clutching their spirulina smoothies, is a new west African restaurant, Akara. Once upon a time, Borough Market was a weekend affair, but now it\u2019s a genteel, organic sort of bedlam every single day. It\u2019s the perfect place to open somewhere like Akara, the second restaurant from Aji Akokomi, who in 2020 opened Akoko, a fine-dining excursion around the owner\u2019s west African heritage that, to my mind, is well worthy of a Michelin star. Akara is Akoko\u2019s more casual younger sibling, a place where newbies to west African cuisine can dangle a toe, while more well-versed diners can come to judge the chef\u2019s take on efik coconut rice in a smart, beautifully lit industrial-chic space. Actual akara are, of course, on the menu, too. They could, roughly speaking, be called fritters, though I\u2019d compare them more to fried fairy cakes \u2013 spongey, golden, almost resembling financiers, although in truth these particular buns, which inspired the Brazilian street-food snack, the acaraj\u00e9, are made from loved and much-laboured-over black-eye beans. The beans are soaked, shelled, whisked, pulverised and transformed into a light batter before being deep-fried until golden. In the wrong hands (namely, my clumsy shovels), akara would be a disaster, but here they are plump, voluptuous and stuffed with the likes of sweet, spiced barbecued tiger prawns, soft, yielding braised ox cheek, barbecued wild mushrooms or a seared hand-dived Orkney scallop. Each akara comes in its own little box, so don\u2019t order them to share, as we did. They are best tackled with both hands and accompanied by the house scotch-bonnet soda, a non-alcoholic beverage offering all the elegance of a cool, clear, long soda with a heat rating of about 200,000 units on the Scoville scale. We visited on a midweek lunchtime, when the place was pleasingly busy, possibly because so many of London\u2019s smart restaurants don\u2019t seem to open until Wednesday evenings at the moment. As a result, Akara was packed with solo food obsessives photographing their lunches and smart business groups enjoying the plantain old fashioneds, the cacao and date negronis and the short wine list. The food is hearty rather than fancy; if, for example, you order the Lagos chicken from the larger plates section of the menu, what turns up is a whole, splayed, spatchcocked poussin drizzled with vibrant orange sosu kaani, a Senegalese hot sauce singing with habanero chilli peppers and garlic. There\u2019s also grilled pollock with a yassa sauce made from deeply caramelised onion and lemon, and a vegan dish of grilled cabbage in carrot sauce and herby oil. This isn\u2019t stand-on-ceremony food, this is a dig-in type of dinner \u2013 although your servers will happily explain the cooking process if you ask them to. The standout dish for me was a side of fried plantain with octopus, served in a curiously delicate and deft way, and made lively with pepper relish. The efik rice is pale, having been simmered in chicken broth and coconut, and, if you like, comes topped with seared mackerel. If you want something green on the table to make you feel healthy, there is a salad of baby gem, crisp shallots and spiced peanuts to pair with your Senegalese-sauced poussin. This is a confident restaurant taking its first tottering steps, offering modern, playful, imaginative riffs on food that clearly means so much to Akokomi. It is no small feat to trailblaze in this way, bringing much-loved dishes to an audience that may never have eaten them before, and hoping both to delight and to broaden horizons. Akoko, for me, was groundbreaking, and the more casual, everyday Akara is a spiriting slice of joy for London\u2019s dining scene. We finished with tamarind date sponge cake with tonka bean cream, which was kind of inevitable from the moment I saw it on the menu, because I am rather fixated by the richness of the tonka bean and the slightly macabre aspect that, in the wrong hands, it can be poisonous; in fact, it has been banned in the US since 1954 due to, ahem, casualties. I trusted Akara not to kill me, though. Let\u2019s face it, the paperwork would be arduous. Less brave sorts can go for the coconut and lime sorbet, which is a citric blast to send you on your way feeling fully awakened. Akara is worth visiting if only for the dish the place is named after. Be honest, you\u2019re never going to shell those black-eye beans yourself. Akara Arch 208, 18 Stoney Street, London SE1, 020-3861 5190. Open Tues-Sat, lunch noon-4pm, dinner 6-11pm.

The New York guitarist and new-music original Mary Halvorson (who, like Wheeler, was once a receptive disciple in the challenging bands of veteran boundary-buster Anthony Braxton) has also made a home in the turbulently dreamlike spaces where composition and the whims of improv meet. Lessons learned as a live improviser and off-stage as an imaginative student of musical form have created the rare artist she\u2019s become. In 2022, Halvorson\u2019s already exalted reputation took a new leap with Amaryllis and Belladonna, albums respectively angled toward improv and written chamber music. Now comes Cloudward, a superb eight-piece set (reflecting in its title and moods the composer\u2019s sense of liberation at the then-receding pandemic) for her sextet, joining guitar and Patricia Brennan\u2019s vibraphone with trumpet, trombone, bass and drums, and the legendary Laurie Anderson on effects-violin for one track. The slowly mounting brass-and-vibes fanfare of The Gate conceals the groove of the building bassline and softly hustling drums that eventually emerge, while trumpeter Adam O\u2019Farrill \u2013 secure and clean-toned all over the horn\u2019s range \u2013 shares beautifully interwoven brass harmonies with trombonist Jacob Garchik on Collapsing Mouth and Unscrolling. The latter is bookended by quiet drum rolls and glittering cymbal flickers, and a contrastingly dark, slithery bowed-bass breakout late on. Halvorson throws distorted guitar into the avant-funky Desiderata; Anderson sketches bugged violin sounds from brass tones to chimes into the graceful arcs of Incarnadine; and the almost Latin jazz-like Tailhead sets exhilarating band-riffing behind the climbing, twisting melody. Halvorson\u2019s fusions of written and spontaneous music reach an entrancing new seamlessness and seductive warmth with this terrific set. Also out this month Much-acclaimed young American vibraphonist Joel Ross releases Nublues (Blue Note) with regular bandmates including gospel-fuelled saxist Immanuel Wilkins. They put orthodox and unorthodox angles on the blues in an occasionally solemn but mostly vibrant tracklist featuring seven originals alongside an implacably grooving account of John Coltrane\u2019s Equinox and a playfully inquisitive one of Thelonious Monk\u2019s Evidence.

But for 2024 I\u2019m buzzing to tell you about two innovations that I believe could and should change how many of us buy makeup. Here\u2019s how foundation is usually sold: brands attempt to anticipate which skin shades will prove useful and popular, manufacture accordingly, then rely on customers and staff to choose the right ones and minimise wasted stock. But genius British brand Dcypher rejects this process. Instead, it relies on AI (I know, but stay with me) to analyse your skin tone using a 60-second online process, and then custom-blends your unique shade to order (\u00a342). This results in zero surplus stock and packaging, and no excess freight and storage. No one can be more astonished than I am that it truly, brilliantly, works. Unlike other online colour matching brands, which tweak one generic foundation, Dcypher allowed me to choose my coverage level and finish, and combined these with my AI-generated shade, which was absolutely spot on. Try it \u2013 I\u2019ll be amazed if you have cause to use their free adjustment service. Whether you\u2019re vegan or not, you may be disgusted to learn that the vast majority of vibrant red lipsticks are made from carmine, a pigment extracted from female beetles. Up to 1,000 of them are sun-dried and crushed to create just one lipstick. The same process is followed for bright red paints, fabric dyes and medications, as well as many foods and drinks, and it is widely accepted that nothing else works as well in delivering rich, vivid reds. Vegan red lipsticks do exist (though they\u2019re often the only non-vegan lipstick in a shade lineup, so do check), but they lack the brilliance and saturation of carmine reds. Carisa Janes, founder of Hourglass Cosmetics, rejected the industry standard and, after three years\u2019 research alongside parent company Unilever, has developed Confession Red 0, a refillable, 100% vegan, patent-pending lipstick for which not a single insect was harmed. This is a true, rich, fire engine-red in a slim bullet for sharp application.

The beautiful LucasArts adventure, The Fate of Atlantis; the pretty good Lego games; the decent Emporer\u2019s Tomb; the presentable SNES side-scroller, Greatest Adventures \u2026 There have been good games, but few classics that transcend the brand like, say, Knights of the Old Republic. Maybe that\u2019s about to change. During Microsoft\u2019s latest Developer Direct online event, streamed on Thursday evening, we saw a 12-minute preview of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a globe-trotting first-person adventure, set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade. The project was revealed three years ago, but this is the first footage we\u2019ve seen, and it\u2019s promising stuff. It has Nazis, it has a whip, it has Dr Jones in deserts, in tombs and arguing with Denholm Elliott in fusty college buildings; and it has a story involving a stolen artefact that is somehow linked to an international network of ancient monuments all of which align with a circle spanning the world. Interestingly, a lot of the lengthy promo video shown during the event is given over to the developer MachineGames explaining why the game uses the first-person perspective. \u201cOur game is all about putting you in Indie\u2019s shoes, letting you see what he sees and feel what he feels,\u201d says senior narrative designer Edward Curtis-Sivess. \u201cFor us at MachineGames, we do that best in first-person. We believe being up close and personal to the adventure is key.\u201d The concern is possibly that the look of Indiana Jones is so iconic, fans will miss seeing him loping about on the screen. Indeed, the two major game franchises most in debt to Raiders of the Lost Ark \u2013 Uncharted and Tomb Raider \u2013 both use a third-person perspective to mimic the cinematic feel of the Indy series. Indeed this game is going to have a hell of a job crawling out from beneath the legacies of those two franchises. They\u2019ve both done the cinematic puzzle-filled action-adventure genre, setting up many of its conventions. In The Great Circle, for example, Indy is accompanied by a headstrong journalist named Gina Lombardi, echoing Nathan Drake\u2019s partner in colonial crime, Elena Fisher. It also looks like there will be some environmental puzzles, with one section taking place in a tomb where stone cogs have to be placed, probably to open a door \u2013 which will look very familiar to anyone who\u2019s played, say, Uncharted 3, Tomb Raider: Anniversary or any number of Indiana Jones-inspired adventures. The video also promises multiple routes through major set-piece locations, with the opportunity to sneak about and study enemy patrol routes. Again, Nathan and Lara have been doing this for years. But this is MachineGames, which brilliantly rebooted the Wolfenstein series \u2013 it\u2019s a studio used to taking established concepts and adding a weird new spin. For those worried about not seeing Indie onscreen, this team brought real detail and character to the protagonist BJ Blazkowicz even though he\u2019s rarely seen in the game. And we are going to see Indy. The video stresses that the camera will pan out to third person at certain sections of the gameplay, and of course there\u2019s a very convincing Harrison Ford model present during the cut-scenes. The character is also being skilfully voiced by video game acting royalty, Troy Baker, best known as Joel from The Last of Us. What\u2019s more promising, however, is the implementation of classic Indy tropes. It looks like his whip can be used as a traversal device as well as a weapon, and we\u2019re getting authentic fistfights with those thundering punch sound effects. Plus, the hubristic Nazi antagonist Emmerich Voss is classic Indy fare. It\u2019s also great to see a role for horror movie stalwart Tony Todd who is seen at the beginning of the game stealing a seemingly minor artefact from Indy\u2019s workplace, Marshall College. It seems unfair that The Great Circle will have to fight with two games that have plundered the Indiana Jones treasury of ideas, images and action. But what it has, of course, is the Lucasfilm legacy \u2013 the character and his universe, the whip, that score and decades of goodwill. Plus MachineGames is a genuinely interesting studio not afraid of compelling, idiosyncratic ideas. If Indy is to triumph over his young usurpers, he\u2019ll need plenty of them. \u2022 Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is due for release later this year on Xbox and PC", "date": "2024-01-19", "section": "Games", "author": "Keith Stuart", "id": 562, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4675fa5a75edaa769a0b25864d5d65dc5c2a65f5/120_0_1800_1080/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018Allowed to be sexy\u2019: how did Anyone But You become a surprise box office hit?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/19/allowed-to-be-sexy-how-did-anyone-but-you-become-a-surprise-box-office-hit", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.037, "neu": 0.712, "pos": 0.252, "compound": 0.9992}, "body": "Although Wonka is the undisputed king of the box office this winter, having earned \u00a356.1m since its release in mid-December, it\u2019s Anyone But You, a frothy romcom that recalls the genre\u2019s 2000s heyday, that\u2019s most surprised the film industry in recent weeks. Released last month, the Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell-starring film opened to meagre box office results in the US \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.7m) during its first weekend \u2013 and a fairly average \u00a31.2m in the UK. Since then, the film has shown surprisingly strong staying power, thanks largely to positive word of mouth, as well as the lack of winter films for female audiences. In its first three weeks at the UK box office, the film has continued to gross in the ballpark of its \u00a31.2m debut, a relatively uncommon box office phenomenon. In the US, it\u2019s shown even stronger performance, making nearly $10m (\u00a37.8m) in its third weekend, and outpacing its $6m debut in each subsequent weekend. Daniel Loria, SVP of film industry technology and data firm The Boxoffice Company, says that to see such strong week-on-week performance for \u201ca shopping mall multiplex title like this one is increasingly rare,\u201d citing 2022\u2019s indie sleeper hit Everything Everywhere All At Once as the most recent example. Since the advent of streaming, he says, studios have been reticent to give underperforming films a long life in cinemas. \u201cThis type of performance used to happen a lot more often, before there was a massive investment into streaming from a number of major studios,\u201d he says. \u201cSony doesn\u2019t have a streaming platform waiting for their content; it\u2019s a studio that still plays by the playbook that was successful for 100 years pre-pandemic.\u201d The success of Anyone But You is a glimmer of resurgence for the humble romcom, a genre that, for the better part of a decade, has been largely relegated to streaming services. Scott Meslow, author of From Hollywood With Love: The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of the Romantic Comedy, says the disappearance of romcoms from the big screen wasn\u2019t due to a lack of audience interest, but to big studios\u2019 increasing interest in high-budget \u201ctentpole\u201d films such as The Avengers and Avatar. \u201cWe were seeing a lot of $200m movies that might make a billion dollars, or a $10m movie given to an auteur that might win best picture at the Oscars,\u201d he says. \u201cIt used to be that there were lots of movies like a $20m romcom that could make $80m and that would be treated as a big success.\u201d The shift to big-budget action disproportionately affected films for female audiences \u2013 who, of course, weren\u2019t actually any less interested in films. Netflix, Meslow says, \u201crealised that romcoms they were licensing were wildly over-performing,\u201d and began putting their own into production. \u201cI talked to screenwriters who had romcoms that were sitting on the shelf for a decade that no one even wanted to take a look at. Suddenly it was \u2018Netflix wants to look at it Friday, and we\u2019ll have an option for you by Monday.\u2019\u201d Large studios, seeing the success of Netflix-produced films such as 2018\u2019s Set It Up, also starring Powell, have begun reinvesting in the genre, resulting in a spate of new romcoms since the pandemic, including The Lost City, starring Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, and Ticket to Paradise, starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts, both released in 2022; and last year\u2019s No Hard Feelings, starring Jennifer Lawrence. Despite the presence of far bigger stars in these films, and far more widespread marketing campaigns, Anyone But You has already eclipsed No Hard Feelings\u2019 US box office, and will probably lap Ticket to Paradise in the US market soon too. Loria says that the release of Anyone But You in the middle of winter, with no significant competition for screens or audiences, is a crucial factor in its success. \u201cThere was no major holiday season blockbuster like Avatar or Spider-Man to take up screens,\u201d he says. \u201cA word-of-mouth title like Anyone But You has that extra opportunity to get extra showtimes and screenings, and has time to find audiences over subsequent weekends.\u201d Hannah Strong, digital editor at Little White Lies magazine, says Anyone But You is \u201cso representative of what audiences want \u2013 that kind of frothy, funny, easygoing film.\u201d She attributes the success of Anyone But You, in part, to the summer 2023 release of Barbie. \u201cI think post-Barbie, people realised they really liked going to the cinema, people that might have stopped during the pandemic, or people that don\u2019t go very often and are now feeling more catered to,\u201d she says. \u201cAnyone But You does serve that female demographic, who sometimes get a bit underserved by mainstream cinema.\u201d Anyone But You also features nudity and sex scenes \u2013 an aspect of mainstream cinema that\u2019s been eulogised just as much as the romcom. \u201cIt does serve an adult audience \u2013 it\u2019s this idea of a romcom being allowed to be sexy, and not being chaste and watered down,\u201d says Strong. \u201cThis is something that a lot of film-makers have talked about in the last few years \u2013 the idea of making films for adults is sometimes completely foreign to studios now. It feels like everyone is so nervous of doing anything that might upset someone [so] they end up coming up with these ideas that have no personality or depth.\u201d The film also has the benefit of bringing together Powell and Sweeney, whose stars have been on the rise since their appearances in Top Gun: Maverick and the HBO teen series Euphoria, respectively. While rumours of an on-set romance drummed up publicity for the film during its production, Strong says it\u2019s unlikely that tabloid gossip contributed to any genuine box office impact \u2013 an idea supported by the film\u2019s tepid first-week box office numbers in the US. Instead, Meslow says, Anyone But You\u2019s success can be chalked up to a good old fashioned Hollywood formula: \u201c[If] you find stars who are hot and want to do movies like this, and you put some actual marketing muscle behind it \u2013 and you made a good movie \u2013 people are going to see it.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-19", "section": "Film", "author": "Shaad D'Souza", "id": 563, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cc74fd66d6d280c6b4b86217d8c212f1677f27ab/0_37_2000_1201/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Six-legged dog found in Wales has surgery to remove extra limbs", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/20/six-legged-puppy-wales-surgery-charity-fundraising-appeal", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.019, "neu": 0.654, "pos": 0.327, "compound": 0.9977}, "body": "A six-legged dog who was found abandoned in a car park has undergone surgery to remove her extra limbs.

The dog was taken in by the Greenacres Rescue charity, near Haverfordwest, and has been cared for by a foster family. She was named after the character from Disney\u2019s film The Little Mermaid because her partly fused extra back legs were said to resemble a mermaid\u2019s tail. Ariel, who was born with multiple birth defects, was operated on at Langford Vets small animal referral hospital in Somerset. A spokesperson for the charity said: \u201cHer additional limbs have been removed. Thankfully, having the CT [computerised tomography] images meant they did not discover anything unexpected, and although it wasn\u2019t a regular amputation, it was \u2018uneventful\u2019. \u201cWhen we spoke, she was in recovery, having lots of love and fuss from the nursing team but all be reassured she\u2019s doing well.

Vicki Black, the Langford Vets hospital director, said: \u201cAriel was a complicated little dog whose care required close collaboration across a number of our specialist-led teams including orthopaedics, soft-tissue surgery, anaesthesia and radiology. \u201cWe are delighted such a lovely dog has recovered from her surgery well. As part of the University of Bristol, we are a centre committed to career-long learning and are proud to innovate and treat pets like Ariel. \u201cAriel deservedly has many devoted supporters.

Film Killers of the Flower Moon (dir Martin Scorsese, 2023) I recently read David Grann\u2019s book: it\u2019s one of the saddest true stories I\u2019ve ever read and something more people should know about. Martin Scorsese\u2019s film was brilliant. It\u2019s about the Osage nation, a tribe of Native Americans living in 1920s Oklahoma who became the wealthiest people in the US, which attracted some pretty evil people. Lily Gladstone plays the lead and her performance was breathtaking. Fun fact: they asked me to audition for the role of Robert De Niro\u2019s wife. I didn\u2019t get it, obviously, but it was fun to be included. 2. Hobby The dulcimer I started playing the dulcimer about a year ago and it\u2019s been so fun. I started finding information online, figuring out chords, and I had one lesson, then I had the audacity to take this thing on tour with me and play it in front of people. It only has three strings and is actually quite easy to pick a melody out on. I see why Joni Mitchell would travel with one: it\u2019s small and lightweight, easier than lugging a guitar through an airport. I hope it inspires people over 40 to pick up a new instrument. 3. Podcast Ten Percent Happier The host, Dan Harris, was a news anchor but got out of the media after having a panic attack and struggling with substances. He describes himself as a \u201cfidgety sceptic\u201d but it\u2019s a Buddhist-leaning podcast: he interviews the Dalai Lama, monks, nuns and guests such as Esther Perel and La Sarmiento. He speaks to people who have been through some pretty terrible things and lived to tell about it, which gives me perspective. He seems like an honest person and has a dark, dry sense of humour. 4. Memoir Don\u2019t Tell Anybody the Secrets I Told You by Lucinda Williams I\u2019m a disciple of Lucinda Williams. For me, she\u2019s one of the greatest songwriters of our time. I listened to the audiobook because I love Lucinda\u2019s voice \u2013 I could hear her talk all day. I loved how upfront she was about her childhood, not having her mom in her life. It was an inspiring story because she did not reach the peak of her fame until she was 51. As women, we have this preconceived notion that it\u2019s all downhill after 30, so this made me have some wind in my sails and think that maybe I\u2019m just getting started. 5. Restaurant Bar Continental, Nashville I enjoy spending time at this restaurant, bar and vinyl listening room. My friend Sean Brock, who is a phenomenal chef and was a friend of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s, has really changed the restaurant game in this town. They have a great menu \u2013 they do a prime rib that they cut at the table \u2013 and wonderful mocktails. There is also an incredible sound system: recently they did a Willie Nelson night and a Dolly Parton dance party. They have these old speakers that were used to mix the Highwaymen\u2019s last album \u2013 it\u2019s a really cool little piece of Nashville history. 6. App Insight Timer I was having a really hard time sleeping: my body can be tired but it can be difficult for me to find stillness at the end of the night, so about six months ago I started using this app for sleep meditations. I just put in headphones and listen to a 10 to 20-minute meditation and it helps shut my mind down. It has definitely improved my sleep. I also enjoy the self-compassion meditations because I am my own worst critic.

When I first saw him looking at a dog? When he first draped a coat over my shoulders on a cold night? We met the traditional way: in a production of Legally Blonde the musical. I was playing Elle and he was playing Warner, the arsehole who breaks up with her and inspires her to get into Harvard Law School. (What, like it\u2019s hard?) Tale as old as time. We sang in harmony and laughed in dance rehearsals when I stepped on his feet. On closing night where there was one kiss in the script, I gave him two. And this is the moment. We stayed friends for a long time afterwards but the tides kept throwing us together. We texted about building the perfect fort to recapture our childhoods and, when we finally had our first date, he had transformed his room into my dream pillow fort. And this is the moment. I have felt limerence fizz in my arms when I\u2019ve been around men before, and it almost always led to heartbreak. So I tended to date men who didn\u2019t make me nervous. Men who made me feel safe. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel those two things at once around a person, until I met Tim. The first night we spent together, we woke up and he said: \u201cMaybe we should \u2026 \u201d and I was certain he is going to say, \u201cJust be friends.\u201d Instead, he suggested we stay at mine. It was 37C and I had better air con. And this is the moment. Now Tim and I share a home, a dog and a Netflix account, though I refuse to learn the password. We also work together, which should be a nightmare but isn\u2019t. It is rare to find a man in showbiz happy to be the wind beneath your wings. He plays guitar and characters in all my shows but never wants the spotlight himself. He\u2019s a rare find \u2013 an artist who genuinely just wants to do the job because it is a nice job to do. After every show people tell me they loved it but they really loved watching Tim watching me. \u201cYou can just see how much he loves you,\u201d they say, to which I want to reply: \u201cHe is a trained actor so he could just be very good at his job.\u201d Still, I\u2019ve never known a more generous man on or off stage. He smiles for photos on the red carpet and he warmly entertains the important people whose names I can\u2019t remember in theatre foyers. When my manager worries I might be burnt out, she asks Tim rather than me because he knows me better than I know myself. When I finish a season he tricks me into stopping and reflecting with a cup of tea and a bath. He is my assistant, my partner, my collaborator. My best friend (yuck!). And he is \u2013 most importantly \u2013 very silly. As I write this, he has come to interrupt me twice to show two versions of the lightning storm he\u2019s watching, through dance. He is not a dancer. When I am sure a new show is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever written, he looks me dead in the eyes and says: \u201cShut the fuck up and have fun.\u201d He holds my hand backstage before every opening night and helps me find my place when I lose my lines. He activates girly mode and gossips with my friends about their romantic escapades. He lets me blame my farts on our dog. These gentle, silly moments every day \u2013 these are when I know.

Despite current rules permitting healthcare workers to bring family members, single mothers, many of them recruited to work in the NHS and care sector, are routinely having their applications denied. The applications are being refused under a decades-old Home Office rule that a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living in the UK, unless the parent living here has sole responsibility. Many of the approximately 150 women who have come forward so far have supplied extensive evidence showing they are the children\u2019s primary caregivers. But the applications have still been refused. Yvonne says she moved to Britain to improve her family\u2019s future. \u201cWe\u2019re searching for greener pastures, to give our kids a better life,\u201d the 34-year-old says. Before departing, she says, her employer reassured her that it should be simple enough for her daughters to join her. So in March 2023 she left the girls in the temporary care of a nanny and boarded a flight. Two months later, after securing accommodation and starting her new job, she applied to the Home Office for the children\u2019s visas. Documents shared with the Observer show she explained that she had always cared for the girls, they had always lived with her, and supplied references from their schools, doctors and grandmother, along with consent letters from the other parent. The application was rejected on the grounds that the girls could live with other relatives, and that Yvonne had not provided \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for them to come. Ten months after she arrived, she is still battling the Home Office to reverse its decision. The girls are in the care of their grandparents, but Yvonne says this is not a long-term fix. \u201cMy parents are both in a bad position physically. They can\u2019t carry the burden of looking after a four-year-old,\u201d she says. \u201cI have looked after my children all their lives. And now to be told I don\u2019t have reason to live with them \u2026 that is the most painful thing.\u201d Another mother, Juliet Mupeni, said her 13-year-old son had been traumatised by the decision not to let him come. Mupeni, 37, a former university lecturer in cybersecurity, who moved from Zimbabwe in May to work as a live-in carer, supplied detailed evidence showing she is the boy\u2019s sole caregiver, including a letter from the Zimbabwean authorities stating she has, and always has had, sole parental responsibility. She also supplied letters from his school, doctor and church pastor, and a consent letter from the boy\u2019s father, who she says she separated from a decade ago. But the Home Office rejected the application, questioning why the boy, who is staying with a family friend, couldn\u2019t live with his dad. Mupeni submitted a fresh application with further proof, but this, too, was refused. In a cruel twist, the rejection letter said the fact the child had been without his mother since she moved to Britain was proof he did not need to come. \u201cMy son feels I have abandoned him. After the second refusal he was very very emotional. He was crying for several days,\u201d she says. \u201cI moved here specifically for his future. If I thought he couldn\u2019t join me I wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d In another case, a mother who was refused permission for her son to join her was told that as the boy\u2019s father had contact with the child \u201coccasionally and sporadically\u201d, this was proof he could stay with him. The Home Office also said a letter saying the child\u2019s grandmother had \u201cchronic conditions\u201d and could not care for the child long-term was not detailed enough, concluding there were no \u201ccompassionate and compelling circumstances\u201d to grant the visa. In other cases, women were asked to provide further evidence to support their applications so applied for court documents in their home countries. They had not needed them before as their separations or custody arrangements were informal. But the Home Office said that as the documents were dated recently, they had only been obtained for the purposes of securing a visa and refused the applications. Carol, 39, a care worker also from Zimbabwe, who has been denied a visa for her 17-year-old daughter, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why they are doing this. It is like we are not human beings. It\u2019s like our families don\u2019t mean as much as the families we are coming to look after.\u201d Lawyers and charities are calling for the cases to be reviewed, and the Home Office approach to be modernised, so that caseworkers give more weight to what is in the children\u2019s best interests. Current Home Office guidance does allow for exceptions, telling caseworkers that even if the sole responsibility test is not met, they can still allow visas if there are compassionate grounds to do so. It explicitly says that a consent letter from the other parent would count in favour of their case. Yet many of the women providing such evidence are still having their children\u2019s visas declined. Applicants can apply for a review but these can be costly, take several months and look only at whether administrative errors were made. Sacha Wooldridge, head of immigration at law firm Birketts, said the sole responsibility test was intended to protect the other parent\u2019s rights, but that it did not recognise \u201ctoday\u2019s modern society\u201d and could be a \u201cvery blunt instrument\u201d. The Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association says the \u201csole responsibility\u201d test is \u201ccompletely out of step with current best practice\u201d. Last year, the cross-party peers on the House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs committee said the policy was tearing apart families and should be revised. Another mother, Amara, who moved from South Africa to Cheshire to work as a live-in carer, urged the Home Office to review the decisions and \u201cshow compassion\u201d. She has been fighting since July for her daughters, 12 and 14, to join her. \u201cWhen I heard about the UK needing healthcare workers I thought, \u2018OK, I would love to go and help out there.\u2019 But it feels like the UK doesn\u2019t care about us,\u201d she said. \u201cI would love the Home Office to be considerate and empathetic. I would ask them to put themselves in my shoes.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-20", "section": "UK news", "author": "Shanti Das Home Affairs Correspondent", "id": 567, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2fe2be1f116aa6b5094de46780cb976a0e7656c4/0_299_3780_2267/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018I\u2019ve made friends for life\u2019: Rising number of travellers find going solo is the ticket to happiness", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/jan/20/ive-made-friends-for-life-rising-number-of-travellers-find-going-solo-is-the-ticket-to-happiness", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.039, "neu": 0.739, "pos": 0.222, "compound": 0.9986}, "body": "The idea of making proper friends with people you meet on holiday is so hilarious to British sensibilities that Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat turned it into a West End comedy. The Unfriend, starring Lee Mack and Sarah Alexander as a British couple who meet Elsa, an American woman travelling solo, is based on the premise that she takes their polite suggestion of a visit as a genuine invitation. The play may be funny, but it seems that increasing numbers of people are on Elsa\u2019s side. Solo travel is on the rise and the chance to make lifelong friendships is at the heart of it. The number of people going on holiday by themselves has risen from 6% in 2011 to 16% in 2023 according to the Association of British Travel Agents, which said people had a \u201cstrong appetite to go it alone\u201d. Some operators have seen big increases \u2013 solo bookings accounted for 46% of Tourhub\u2019s business last year. Solo doesn\u2019t always mean alone though. Lots of solo travellers join group tours, as Jen Burton did last year. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone at all and turned up at the airport completely terrified,\u201d said Burton, 40, who opened the Bea and Aud Lifestyle clothes shop in Buckingham last year. \u201cNow I\u2019ve made friends for life.\u201d She had recently split from her husband of 19 years, and had decided to join an Intrepid Travel trip to Jordan for 16 women organised by Claire and Laura Jopson, who run the travel blog Twin Perspectives. \u201cI walked up to some of the ladies in the check-in queue and straight away they kind of knew that I\u2019d been having a really tough time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe support you can get from a group of women you don\u2019t even know is phenomenal.\u201d Burton, who was the oldest, added: \u201c[I had] never laughed so hard in my whole life. But then in the next instance we\u2019d have these amazing feminist chats.\u201d Since the Jordan trip, many of the women have stayed in touch and last week Burton was hosting an Australian friend she met while travelling. Norway is next. \u201cThis time I\u2019ll share a room,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was slightly missing out in my own room.\u201d Companies such as Just You and Flash Pack cater specifically for solo travellers, while others, including Newmarket Holidays, Riviera Travel and Jules Verne, offer solo-only or solo-friendly trips. \u201cSixty per cent of our travellers are solo,\u201d said Yves Marceau, vice president for products at G Adventures. He said the company went to great efforts to design tours that fostered friendships, making sure there was enough time for people to meet each other and mingle. Tour guides were trained to create a sense of camaraderie and to spot when people might not be getting on. \u201cA young man in his early 20s wrote to us about his trip,\u201d Marceau said. \u201cHe was sharing a room with a guy who was 75. He said \u2018my initial reaction was, Oh, my God, this is going to be a dreadful experience. But over the course of the first few days, I became so connected with this gentleman that we are still friends.\u2019 Those [stories] are the reason we do this.\u201d G Adventures and some other firms, such as Hostelworld, have created their own apps with social elements, but smaller companies use other social media. Chris Bone, the founder of Adventure Solos, invites every tour member to a WhatsApp group when they book. \u201cIt really breaks the ice,\u201d Bone said. He runs adventure weekends and week-long expeditions around the UK, with activities including hiking, canoeing and climbing. \u201cOften people might be travelling a long way, and they\u2019ll car share or get the same train. And often people have been to events before.\u201d It means that an hour into a hike, Bone\u2019s guests are very relaxed. \u201cWhat\u2019s really nice is that all this stuff comes flooding out. People have often been through a recent life change. But no one knows anyone else and [there are] no preconceived ideas.\u201d Not that every group creates friendships. \u201cThere were a couple of guys who were persistently late every day,\u201d said Carole Railton, a body language expert and author, of a trip to Morocco. \u201cWe had buses picking us up or trains to catch, and they would amble down. People were grumpy because they were taking time out of everyone\u2019s holiday.\u201d Joyce Connor, a makeup artist, was one of only two solo travellers on a trip to Vietnam, and the other woman was much older. \u201cI\u2019m 60,\u201d she said. \u201cI basically ended up being her carer for two weeks. It wasn\u2019t fun. She didn\u2019t know how to use her phone or check in for her flight. And she didn\u2019t want to eat alone, but she only wanted to go to places that had English food. In Vietnam. \u201cBut on another trip I met a woman on day two and it turned out we have a mutual friend. Now the three of us go out together.\u201d There are still plenty of solo travellers who avoid groups, and life has become easier for them. People used to look down on solo travellers, according to Georgie Darling, a freelance travel writer. \u201cIt was something people thought you did out of desperation. Now it\u2019s become more of a \u2018cool concept\u2019.\u201d Travel influencers on TikTok and Instagram, such as Janet Newenham, have shown that solo travel can be admirable, Darling said. She stays in co-living spaces \u2013 hostels with private rooms and workplaces. \u201cI look for expat groups in the city or town I\u2019m at. So I\u2019m in Mexico now, and this morning I\u2019m going to a brunch for female entrepreneurs. Everyone is here with the intention of meeting new people \u2013 last night there was a taco bar crawl. \u201cI\u2019ve just joined a WhatsApp group for women in London who are solo travelling. And already there\u2019s been about 15 different trips arranged, with people saying \u2018I\u2019m going to be in Copenhagen this weekend\u2019.

But I have at least come to a kind of accommodation with this long, dark month, a grudging respect for its uncompromising January-ness, which, looked at in the right way, can be seen as a kind of tonic or antidote to the glittery, sugary, fatty excesses of December. Certainly, in the kitchen so far this year, I\u2019ve come to appreciate the unfussy, almost austere charms of this season\u2019s vegetables cooked simply: the sweetly earthy bass tones of root vegetables and the trilling variations on a theme of bittersweet of cabbages, kale and sprouts. As for wine, I reckon the ideal style for this sort of food and mood, and weather, are reds that are filled with flavour, depth and texture, but don\u2019t feel fat or sweet or overly rich and syrupy, and which invigorate with acidity like a shaft of piercing wintry light: over to you Piero Busso. Tesco Finest Ribera del Duero, Spain 2021 (\u00a312, Tesco) Italy is a fertile source of wines that have the balance of depth and brightness I\u2019m looking for in January. The nebbiolo grape used to produce the delightfully pristine, fragrant red fruit in Piero Busso Langhe Nebbiolo, for example, is also used to make Barolo and Barbaresco, two great Piemontese wines which, with their trademark mix of satisfyingly sandpapery tannins and ethereal fragrance would be on my table every night in winter were I a considerably wealthier man. (If you do have circa \u00a350 to \u00a360 to spare, you could do worse than spend it on one of Piero Busso\u2019s Barberesco wines from justerinis.com and others). More affordably, from Piedmont, Morrisons The Best Barbera d\u2019Asti 2020 (\u00a37) offers a robust, high-acid hit of intense dark plum and cherry, while Tesco can offer a wintry alternative from the high-altitude Spanish region of Ribera del Duero, where the ample inky mulberry fruit is offset by a dusting of spice and a shaft of cool-night freshness. Teliani Valley Winery 97 Saperavi, Kakheti, Georgia 2021 (from \u00a311.69, premiercrufinewine.co.uk; nywines.co.uk; ndjohn.co.uk) Other red wines that seem to fit this moment can be found farther east from two ancient wine cultures that have been enjoying a renaissance in recent years: Georgia and Greece. In Georgia, it\u2019s the saperavi grape variety that offers the collection of qualities that I seem to crave: it makes dark, inky, almost opaque red wines that at their best are fit to burst with blackberry juiciness and peppery and dark chocolatey flavour, but which, as is the case of the wines of Teliani, are succulent, bright and invigoratingly sappy, grippy and savoury. In Greece, meanwhile, I love the red-plum skin tang and cherry-ish acidity that enlivens Semeli Feast Red, Nemea 2022 (from \u00a39.95, thewinesociety.com; henningswine.co.uk; novelwine.co.uk), while the xinomavro grape variety, as used in star winemaker Apostolos Thymiopoulos\u2019 Earth &amp; Sky 2021 (from \u00a326, thewinesociety.com; vincognito.co.uk) has notes of juniper, pomegranate and red cherry in a perfume-and-power combination that makes it the Macedonian answer to Barolo.

The cause: a five-acre organic garden in southern Kerala. Close by the ocean. The soil is rich and red, with a crumb like cake. Everywhere, an abundant variety of fruit and vegetables. Snake gourds, aubergine, turmeric, ginger, species of extravagant beans. There are multiple varieties of chilli. Plus, tomatoes and peppers, many trays of coriander. Coconut is abundant: crazily tall skinny trees, alarmingly cropped by men free-climbing on spiked metal shoes. Fruit is hacked off with machetes, branches crashing down. I take to wandering around most mornings. Often in envy, more often in near-open-mouthed admiration. I am joined by shrieking peacocks, a pair of playful mongooses. Paths are lined with clover. Also marigolds grown for companion planting and puja. At the bottom of the site is a huge, ancient water tank. Just beyond it, a rich neighbour\u2019s incongruous helipad. There are many beds of yams and red amaranth. Grown from single seedlings immaculately spaced for optimum growth. I feel I am being gently schooled. Banana plants are dotted through the site. Their fruit no larger than fat fingers. Papaya cascades in extravagant bunches. I am inspired by a recycling innovation. Decapitated 5-litre plastic water bottles used as plant pots. The tops put out as mini greenhouses covering germinating seed. Another revelation is bhindi: lady fingers. I only today discovered it is a Hibiscus esculentus. Beautiful tall, single-flowered mallow plants spiked with cornered fruit. A gardener breaks one off for us to eat raw. It\u2019s crisp, delicate, delicious. Later, we enjoy them in vegetable thoran. In a sambar with idli for breakfast. Both are simple perfection: inspirational plot to plate. But now please tell us: what gardening or gardeners inspire you?

Cynics might say they were any cream you slap on at bedtime. They\u2019re just thicker moisturisers, right? To be clear: they are not, or at least they shouldn\u2019t be. During the day your skin works overtime to protect itself from environmental aggressors. At night it goes into repair mode, which means it needs products to work accordingly. While you sleep, the skin loses a higher rate of moisture than it does during the day \u2013 it\u2019s known as transepidermal water loss \u2013 so a day cream won\u2019t touch the sides. Meaning you need great night-time formulas with powerful ingredients. Many of these increase your skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun, but they are perfect to use while you sleep. So with the plethora of night creams on the market, how does one choose? Well think about what issue you want to tackle and be led by the ingredients that help with that: retinols and glycolic acids help to refine, resurface and smooth skin texture; vitamin C and other acids (malic and lactic, for instance) will help brighten skin; ceramide-rich night products are great for firming, plumping and boosting the skin\u2019s barrier, etc. The tried and tested is also not a bad place to start: Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Advanced Night Repair is an excellent beauty editor stalwart that addresses everything from hydration to radiance. Oh, and another thing to note: night creams can be serums or even masks. They don\u2019t have to be creams. 1. Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair \u00a365, esteelauder.co.uk 2.

Yet when Stravinsky\u2019s Les Noces sounds across the elegantly transfigured spaces of a former fireworks factory in Woolwich, it rings as shockingly original as it did on its premiere in 1923. Giselle, with Adolphe Adam\u2019s tinkling score wafting across the London Coliseum\u2019s gilded auditorium, not so much. Mary Skeaping\u2019s 1971 production of this great Romantic ballet for English National Ballet, however, has the merit of reminding us just why, in 1841, it too was full of the shock of the new. A story about the exploitation of the lower classes; an eerie supernatural second act; a heroine dancing on pointe shoes, light as a feather, seeming to materialise out of the air; a ballerina taking centre stage for the first time. It remains a glorious sight, and ENB dance it with loving care. The second act is a wonder of chiaroscuro, shafts of light (courtesy of David Mohr\u2019s lighting design) dappling the skirts of the ghostly Wilis as they pursue hapless men to their deaths; the corps de ballet bring both menace and a graceful uniformity to the scene. As Giselle, Ukrainian first soloist Katja Khaniukova performs with striking truthfulness. There\u2019s a clip of her on YouTube being coached by Alessandra Ferri, one of the great Giselles, and that learning is reflected in the clarity and directness of the first act, when this girl who lives to dance heartbreakingly dies of a broken heart. In the second, when she returns as a ghost, it\u2019s her honesty that carries her through; you believe this is a woman who would want to save Aitor Arrieta\u2019s remorseful, noble Albrecht. Fabian Reimair makes a notably tortured Hilarion, Albrecht\u2019s rival, whose jealousy precipitates the tragedy; it\u2019s nice to see him played as a disappointed man in love rather than a meddling baddie. Alison McWhinney is a chilly Myrtha, imperious queen of the Wilis. Woolwich Works is a happening artistic development in a changing part of London, home to Carlos Acosta\u2019s Dance Centre and Punchdrunk theatre\u2019s base. At the Fireworks Factory, the New Movement Collective, a group of enterprising contemporary dancers, many of whom have worked with Rambert, presented an ambitious hour-long bill built around Stravinsky\u2019s Les Noces (originally choreographed by Nijinska). It\u2019s extraordinary how this 100-year old piece still sounds more revolutionary than the new music with which it\u2019s surrounded here. Les Noces: The Departure is jointly choreographed by its performers and features new compositions from Andrea Balency-B\u00e9arn and Yshani Perinpanayagam. The first contains resounding bells and fiercely plucked piano strings; the second is a setting of John Cage\u2019s love letters to Merce Cunningham, communicatively sung by baritone Ross Ramgobin, accompanied on piano by Perinpanayagam, who is also music director and conductor for the night. The main event, in Stravinsky\u2019s original version for four pianos, percussion, a choir and four soloists, is compellingly played by musicians from the Royal College of Music, with the chorus of Opera Holland Park. When soprano April Koyejo-Audiger sings the opening bars \u2013 \u201cListen\u201d \u2013 from the midst of the gathered dancers at the centre of a long catwalk of a stage, there\u2019s a thrilling sense of anticipation. If the new choreography never quite matches the challenge of the music, it\u2019s attractive enough, unfolding through groupings of sharply angled arms and curved backs; the dancers alternately supporting one another and breaking away, suggesting a community at one and at war. Clothes are knotted together to hold an individual aloft or to suggest a bridal veil. It\u2019s interesting but not quite dynamic enough, a thought rather than a propulsion. The evening, gently braided together like the bride\u2019s plait, ends with Chameleon Youth from Manchester moving to MC Zani\u2019s Rhythmic Resurgence, a response to Stravinsky\u2019s rhythm through the mouth of beatboxer Jack Hobbs. The whole thing makes for an adventurous entertainment.

In 2012 he won a joint Olivier award with Benedict Cumberbatch for Frankenstein on stage, and this month stars in the West End transfer of Sam Holcroft\u2019s play A Mirror, which was a sell-out hit at the Almeida last summer. Miller lives mainly in New York, where he is a volunteer firefighter, and has a 15-year-old son. How does it feel to go on stage every night? Are there nerves? Terror? Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t call it terror. It\u2019s frightening, for sure, but that\u2019s what makes it so much fun. It\u2019s really the most fun you\u2019re going to have acting. Because it\u2019s live and people demonstrate their enjoyment of it. You don\u2019t get that electric experience from even some of the most intense things doing film and television. A Mirror starts out as a wedding at which the audience are guests. But it soon becomes clear that it\u2019s actually an underground dramatic performance set in an unspecified totalitarian society. What appealed to you about the play? Honestly, all the characters have a journey. I know that sounds cliched, but they\u2019re all not what they seem. And there are many layers. So we have a play within a play within a play at some point. My character is the minister of culture, who thinks he\u2019s a good guy, but is he? So the play explores artistic expression, truth, fiction and censorship. Which makes it sound quite heavy, but it\u2019s actually very funny. What\u2019s the best and worst thing about being back in the UK? Well, I get to see people I haven\u2019t seen, which is a gift. But at the same time you can\u2019t watch football on television on a Saturday, when they play the games, which is just a constant source of bemusement and makes me furious. So that\u2019s a problem. You qualified last year as a volunteer firefighter in Long Island, New York. Have you seen any action yet? Yeah, just when I was leaving last summer to come to the Almeida, I did get to go on my first fire. The siren goes off, our pagers go off, and I ran out of my house, and I could smell the smoke in the air, so it was very close. And the pager tells us that we have a residential structure fire, which is serious. So it was nerve-racking and you just don\u2019t want to make a mistake. But we actually managed to get this fire put out before it took two houses, and nobody got hurt. So it was the perfect call-out really. It\u2019s probably a trite comparison, but how does the buzz compare to, say, getting the very good reviews for A Mirror? Acting, we tell stories, and that serves a function and it\u2019s important. But to respond to a medical emergency or just to be able to actually have an impact like that on somebody else\u2019s life, it doesn\u2019t really compare. Honestly, if I could make a living doing it, I may well just do that. Does Trainspotting remain as treasured for you as it does for many of us? Of course. I owe so much to that experience. Especially the older you get, the more you look back and think: \u201cWow, how lucky to have been involved in something like that.\u201d Whatever else happens, you can always be proud of that. You\u2019ve suggested before that you didn\u2019t fully capitalise on the success of the film. Do you still feel that? Yeah, but it\u2019s not something that bothers me. It\u2019s just life. Everything worked out great, really. I was secretly ambitious, but I didn\u2019t really know how to execute that or take advantage of certain opportunities. But it\u2019s all good, because I\u2019m here in a freezing-cold church rehearsing a play! There\u2019s been a 90s revival trend the past few years. When you think of your own personal experience of the decade, what pops into your head? I can\u2019t remember! Look, just absolute joy is what pops into my head. You\u2019re in a successful movie, so you get to hang out with Oasis and stuff like that, and I just loved all that shit. We were young and having fun, so no harm done really. It\u2019s the time when you\u2019ve just left home and you\u2019re figuring out how to negotiate your career path, people and relationships. But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s all over though! You had some high-profile relationships, including being married to Angelina Jolie. Are you relieved social media wasn\u2019t around back then? Yep. I can\u2019t really imagine\u2026 And I don\u2019t know how people navigate that when they\u2019re doing the kind of shit I was doing. You were cast, somewhat against type, as John Major in The Crown. Did you change your perspective on him? One hundred per cent changed my perspective. I was raised in a very, very socialist household, but the more I read about Sir John, the more I liked him. He\u2019s one of the most misunderstood politicians ever: he was very magnetic and had a great sense of humour. That\u2019s actually how Peter Morgan [the creator of The Crown] described him to me. He said: \u201cHe\u2019s George fucking Clooney!\u201d Oh right, what am I doing here then? What would you predict and hope for yourself for the next few years? Oh, Jesus! I don\u2019t live extravagantly and I\u2019d like to be able to make enough money acting so that I can be a firefighter and a parent as much as possible. My child is everything to me. And I don\u2019t need to work for the sake of it, so the less work I do, the more I can put into it. My dream is to not be on everyone\u2019s screens too much, but to make it good when I am. It sounds like you\u2019re in a good place\u2026 Thanks, man, it\u2019s only taken me 50 years.

Pigs wearing pig costumes, alien creatures spanking each other\u2019s botties, relationship dynamics explored via gibberish, talking cats and noodly cartoons. My friends and I are in deep, but how did this happen? \u201cCuteness has been slowly taking over our world,\u201d says Claire Catterall, curator of the Cute exhibition at London\u2019s Somerset House. \u201cIt\u2019s now accepted as one of our languages.\u201d It\u2019s a language that wouldn\u2019t exist without the internet. Even in 2014, Tim Berners-Lee expressed surprise at how his invention was being used. \u201cI\u2019m amazed to see the many great things it\u2019s achieved.\u201d Another thing that surprised him? \u201cKittens,\u201d he told Reddit readers. You could see the origins of cute, its Rosetta Stone, perhaps, in one memorable cat meme from 2007, \u201cI can haz cheezburger?\u201d which gave rise to lolspeak, still influencing the way we talk online. Words like zoomies, gorlies and besties are still riding high. Clearly, something in this squishy way of talking captivates us, even shapes our identity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where cuteness will go or how it will be used, but we do know it\u2019s powerful,\u201d says Catterall. (Of course she has the word \u201ccat\u201d in her name.) So why is cuteness everywhere and what does it mean for us? To answer, we must consider a more basic question, that turns out to be surprisingly slippery. What is cuteness? At the basic level, it\u2019s an evolutionary adaptation, developed by babies so we don\u2019t abandon them for being useless. Yet it\u2019s also cultural. Most of our sparkly, rainbow vocabulary of cuteness comes from kawaii, an aesthetic that developed in Japanese girls\u2019 schools around 1900. It influenced manga and anime, before being commercialised by brands. Particularly one. In the 1990s, every girl I knew \u2013 all five of them \u2013 was obsessed with Hello Kitty. They stuck her on their books, bags and hearts. Author Christine Yano has coined the term \u201cpink globalisation\u201d to describe the domination of the demure, cat-like figure created by entertainment company Sanrio to rival Mickey Mouse. In her wake came San-X bears, Tamagotchi, Pok\u00e9mon and Pusheen in the US. Hello Kitty mewed so that they could\u2026 make whatever noises they make. Actually, I don\u2019t know if she mewed. She has no mouth. Kawaii evolved, influencing Korean culture, its current torchbearer. We can detect it in playful, street-style subcultures, including Decora, which focuses on charms, hairbows and other accessories. If young people are wearing something you don\u2019t understand \u2013 well, now you do. This is where things get weird. Cuteness is a manipulation, designed to trigger our protective instinct, but it isn\u2019t just triggered by human offspring. In 1943, animal behaviourist Konrad Lorenz described the \u201cchild scheme\u201d: a set of physical features that make certain creatures adorable to us. It includes big heads and large eyes, short, thick extremities and round bodies. He\u2019s talking about chonky bois. Studies have proved we actually find puppies cuter than babies. This makes sense of the hapless, round, bumbling anthropomorphic figures that deluge social media. They, too, in a sense, have been selectively bred. In an attention economy, cuteness hacks our brains, emotionally attaching us to almost anything. How is it advantageous that if someone sticks eyes on a watermelon, we\u2019d take a bullet for it? Things get more nuts when you consider the odd range of stuff we find cute. Kittens and bunnies, but also hairless cats and killer dolls. In his book The Power of Cute, philosopher Simon May proposes that cuteness exists on a spectrum. At one pole, childlike objects that arouse our protective instincts; towards the uncanny end, \u201csweet qualities get distorted into something darker, more indeterminate and more wounded\u201d. This \u201cunpindownability\u201d explains how cute objects can be simultaneously ugly and appealing, young and old, monstrous and sweet. Catterall points to ET and Yoda, but I\u2019m immediately reminded of Gus, the three-legged, one-eyed Chinese crested dog voted \u201cugliest dog in the world\u201d eight times, before dying of cancer. I have a picture of Gus on my wall, liver spotted and tongue-lolling, hideous really, but he makes my heart burst with love. The most disturbing aspect of cuteness, though, is its amorality. I\u2019m addicted to the Instagram account @sylvaniandrama, which enacts tales of prison breaks, casual drugs and slatternly behaviour with family dolls. In an essay for the Cute exhibition, Isabel Galleymore describes how wholesome imagery can equally lend its affective power to extremists. She gives the example of Moominvalley, which has been appropriated by eco-fascists, who are both white supremacists and environmentalists. In one meme, \u201cSnufkin, a deep thinker who enjoys fishing and playing his harmonica, bears a swastika on his green felt hat.\u201d Cuteness is deeply subversive, according to Cute Studies scholars (bet they have amazing stationery). Why is it everywhere now? The answer is in our cultural moment. We\u2019re drawn to na\u00efve things as a form of magical thinking \u2013 a desire to live in a cruelty-free world, where everything is safe. We use \u201cadulting\u201d as a verb now, as if there were another option. Glittery unicorns are one way off this collapsing planet, with its daily horrors. But you know how anxiety works. It gets through. That\u2019s why the other side speaks to us, too. Figures like Gloomy Bear, a pink ursine with blood perpetually dripping from his paws. While writing this, a friend on holiday in Thailand sent me a picture of a T-shirt emblazoned with a cartoon sun, dolphins with dog faces, and the words \u201cI\u2019m dead inside!\u201d I asked her to get me two. As Simon May tells me over email, dark cuteness \u201cboth comforts us in a world of unnerving uncertainty \u2013 and gives voice to that same world, but crucially in a lighthearted register\u201d. Look at Gudetama, a more recent Sanrio figure, described as \u201cHello Kitty for millennials\u201d. An egg yolk with a butt, but no neck, the blobby, genderless figure is notable for its low-octane personality. It mostly lies in its albumen, feeling lazy and defeated. It is vulnerable, but more than that, it\u2019s tired, boss. Gudetama is all of us. We don\u2019t take cute things seriously, but we do listen, says Catterall. They \u201callow difficult things to be said openly. It\u2019s a safe space.\u201d The Somerset House exhibition shows how artists like Rachel Maclean are drawn to the boundary-less, fluid nature of cute, the way it undermines rigid categories and provides space for otherness. The language of cuteness is getting more sophisticated. But most of us are not artists and not sophisticated. I worry that I\u2019m slowly boiling myself into idiocy. I overuse exclamation marks and kisses, whether I\u2019m replying to a plumber\u2019s quote or the prime minister\u2019s press secretary. The childish excitability is another way I have grown cute. I routinely have to do a \u201cderangement proofread\u201d of work emails, removing 60% of the punctuation, before signing off, \u201cNo worries!\u201d In real life, I\u2019m very worries. I think this is why many of us scrape and cringe our way through written exchanges. We\u2019re aware how easily tone can be missed \u2013 what if we\u2019re offending someone, without realising? In this paranoid atmosphere, a short sentence looks dismissive. A full stop, downright rude. \u201cOK\u201d, once an unremarkable response, now feels like slamming dog-mess through a letterbox. Online communication seems to boil down to a simple choice: charge into a possible war every day, guns out, or else recuse ourselves on the grounds that we are just a silly lil\u2019 floofer. Cuteness has a solution \u2013 enter our friend, the emoji. The colourful, non-aggressive stickers have transformed messaging. I use them in every message, every reaction. But to what end? Over Zoom, I consult Jo Nicholl, a relationship therapist and podcast host who has lived in Asia. Before I ask a question, Nicholl demonstrates the new cute craze from Vietnam that her son has taught her. It\u2019s similar to the photo trend of joining one\u2019s hands together, shaping a heart in negative space. Instead, Nicholl crosses the tops of her thumb and first fingers \u2013 think a pinch of salt, but slightly wider. \u201cIt\u2019s like a heart emoji, but it\u2019s two little baby hearts!\u201d she squeals, before dropping her voice ominously. \u201cFuck off already. I\u2019m over it.\u201d What\u2019s wrong with using emoji? \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional bypass,\u201d she explains. We rely on them to represent how we feel, the problem being that \u201cthey\u2019re an expanded range of Mister Men cartoons.\u201d How many times a day do we send the heart emoji? Does it mean the same thing every time? Unlikely. Emoji homogenise feelings and shortcut personal expressions, says Nicholl, whose work involves teaching people to have adult conversations and better understand themselves. We hide in cuteness, she says. Our true feelings are usually ambivalent and complicated. Her concerns extend beyond the personal. \u201cWe are being trained to look at objects of limited emotional width and say, \u2018This is my feeling\u2019,\u201d Nicholl explains. The problem is, identification cuts two ways. \u201cWe are being led into a world in which we get used to looking at non-human, AI faces and think we know what they\u2019re feeling. A world in which AI tells us how we feel.\u201d This will probably be how we diagnose emotional distress in future, she predicts. \u201cWe won\u2019t sit with a therapist, we\u2019ll be with an AI.\u201d Who loves cute things most? Advertising executives! There\u2019s a reason meerkats peddle boring, insurance-based price-comparison websites. Rebecca Hughes, a brand strategist, cites the example of Guide Dogs for the blind. For \u201ca charity that provides much needed support for blind people, their early ads didn\u2019t feature blind people very much,\u201d she notes. Bouncy labrador puppies were simply the more effective sell. Advertising is an industry that grasps the dark power of an amoral appeal to feelings. Cuteness reduces price sensitivity, which makes us happier to hand over money. Research also suggests that when companies transgress, having a cute mascot makes consumers want to protect them. The brands themselves are seen as \u201cmalleable\u201d, or in the process of growing and learning. Here is a sleeping giant, overlooked for being feminine and trivial. Don\u2019t doubt that this is a force shaping us. As the web evolves and self-presentation becomes ever more important, cuteness offers us a way to hide and expose, be perfect and vulnerable, irresistible yet anarchic. Cuteness may be everywhere, but it\u2019s far from clear it has our best interests at heart. The horizon is pink, but hazy. It strikes me there\u2019s a comparison with humour. Both feel good, while undermining fixed categories \u2013 that\u2019s how punchlines work. Comedy was considered low art before it came to dominate the mainstream. It has since become a cultural battleground. Something as affable as being funny can undermine democracies, its rock stars carrying the darkness of their work into life. Am I saying we should cancel kittens? Don\u2019t get cute. We should perhaps try to interrupt its manipulations, though. Hack the hack, as it were. Working on the exhibition has changed Catterall. She\u2019s no longer affected the way she once was by images of \u201canything maimed, hurt or pathetic, tugging at the heart strings\u201d. She finds the knowledge of what they\u2019re trying to do strangely repulsive. \u201cAt the same time, give me a puppy and I\u2019m a puddle.\u201d Cute is at Somerset House, London WC2, from 25 January to 14 April.

The city has lately defeated a military expedition from Athens and thousands of surviving invaders have been thrown into nearby quarries to rot. No Syracusans lament their fate until two locals visit one day with an idea to cast the prisoners in a play by Euripides. The two men are Gelon, a melancholy theatre obsessive, and his wisecracking friend Lampo, who narrates the novel in a distinctly un-Sicilian voice. \u201cWould you be knowing any passages?\u201d he demands of a near-dead Athenian, seeking an actor to play Jason in Medea. Soon the pair are sneaking down daily to rehearse their ragtag troupe for a double bill to which the whole town is invited. It\u2019s an uproarious premise, but Irish accents aside, the scenario isn\u2019t quite as far-fetched as it might appear. There are accounts in Plutarch of Athenian prisoners in Sicily trading lines of Euripides in return for food and drink or even freedom. The novel is raucously funny \u2013 Lampo is a brilliant comic creation \u2013 but Lennon, a classics graduate, blends the laughs with tragedy of the blackest pitch. The writing is beautifully controlled. The eyes of a vengeful Syracusan, hollowed out by grief, become \u201ca black sea under an eclipse\u201d. Gelon\u2019s breath, in one dismal scene, \u201cmakes weird shapes in the air like grey flowers are bursting from his lips and wilting on the wind\u201d. Lampo does atrocious things in a bid to be helpful. Scrabbling for money to buy costumes, he proposes robbing an old man with no legs. Later, marvelling that strangers gave up their lives to save his, he wonders if he\u2019d have done the same. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he decides. But his experience in the quarries, collaborating with enemies to shed light on human suffering through theatre, does unlock selfless impulses he never knew he had. Lennon stops well short of suggesting that stories have the power to heal the world, but \u2013 just sometimes \u2013 they can make a difference to individual lives. As Lampo puts it in a moment of fleeting optimism: \u201cI\u2019m pouring water in the desert, hoping flowers grow.\u201d Glorious Exploits by Ferdia Lennon is published by Fig Tree (\u00a316.99).

Differences between what home means when you\u2019re young and when you\u2019re older, differences between being good at something and being passionate about it, and the difference between a movie and a film. A movie, according to them, is big: ambitious, widescreen, built for success. A film is smaller: personal, niche, hopeful of attention. The Kitchen is a new Netflix drama that Kaluuya wrote, produced and co-directed with Kibwe Tavares, and in which Robinson (Kano for his music) stars. The Kitchen is definitely, they say, a movie. \u201cWe\u2019re making a MOVIE!\u201d\u201d says Robinson to Kaluuya. \u201cI remember early days, when you were talking about The Kitchen, that\u2019s what you kept saying. It was distinctly a movie versus a film. Like the anti-kitchen sink.\u201d Kaluuya laughs. \u201cWe\u2019re not kitchen sink, we\u2019re the whole kitchen. The whole fucking room.\u201d Kaluuya, 34, has a big, infectious laugh, and I\u2019m happy to hear it. We\u2019re about 15 minutes into the interview, and at the start, he wasn\u2019t laughing at all. Everything had been a bit rushed. They were both late for the photos, because of grooming and styling, and though the photographer worked amazingly quickly, they still have to leave at a non-negotiable time, because Kaluuya is acting in another film, and he\u2019s due on set. So there was a slight air of tension during pictures (the room was packed with stylists and PRs), and for the first 10 minutes of our interview, Kaluuya hardly speaks. He doesn\u2019t seem grumpy, just unforthcoming, his big eyes assessing. But then he suddenly perks up (he likes my big notebook, he tells me, it reminds him of his school books) and the atmosphere changes, snap! Like the sun coming out. That\u2019s how charismatic Kaluuya is. When he shines, you see not only the dazzling Oscar-winning acting hero, but the director who can motivate and encourage, get everyone grinning and working together. When he\u2019s in, he\u2019s all in. Robinson, 38, also charming, is more even, less front foot. Fans of his music know his dynamics \u2013 he can move from introspection to cold anger to up-in-your-face energy \u2013 and he can be rigorous, as well as raucous. But when he, too, breaks into guffaws, it\u2019s like the hotel room is a balloon. Up we go! Both are hugely popular and respected. Kaluuya has given brilliant performances in films as wildly different as Get Out, Queen &amp; Slim, Black Panther and Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse and won an Oscar in 2021 for his portrayal of Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. Robinson, whose last two albums, 2016\u2019s Made in the Manor and 2019\u2019s Mercury-nominated Hoodies All Summer, received extensive critical acclaim, spent 2018 to 2023 playing main man Sully in possibly the most influential UK TV series of recent years, Top Boy. They are big stars, and to get the two of them in the same room is a coup. When I tell people I\u2019m interviewing Robinson and Kaluuya, together, they practically faint. They\u2019ve been friends for ages, but neither can recall how or where they met. When I ask, they look at each other, puzzled. \u201cFrom about, just London\u201d is the conclusion. So who stays at parties the longest? They both burst out laughing. \u201cHe stays the longest,\u201d says Kaluuya, \u201cbut while I\u2019m there!\u201d Robinson: \u201cTwo hours turns into 10\u2026\u201d Kaluuya: \u201cI like to stay! I love music, I love music.\u201d Robinson: \u201cHe\u2019s the party starter!\u201d They are full of mischief. A few weeks after our interview, they both travel to the US to promote The Kitchen, and, on Instagram, you can see their \u201cout out\u201d vibe: messing around at basketball games, playing for the camera. These boys work and then, they play. That serious but fun mood is woven through The Kitchen, which is set on a dilapidated council estate called the Kitchen in a dystopian, near-future London. Authoritarian outside forces attack the estate, but among the residents, there\u2019s solidarity and joy. A sequence in a roller disco, where everyone joins in the Candy dance, is about as upbeat a nightclub scene as I\u2019ve ever seen on film. \u201cYeah,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cWhen that scene wrapped, we were meant to leave, but you [Kaluuya] were like, Noooo!\u201d \u201cI was with the DJ going, \u2018Drop another one, drop another one,\u201d\u2019\u2019 says Kaluuya. \u201cAnd she played Pop Smoke and it went off! And then I was like, \u2018Play Kano\u2026!\u2019 That scene is real because it was real. You can feel it.\u201d The Kitchen took a long time to come to screen \u2013 Kaluuya started writing it as far back as 2012 \u2013 but he and co-director Tavares always had Robinson in mind for the main part, and involved him throughout, exchanging ideas on voice notes and WhatsApps. Originally, Kaluuya\u2019s film concept was inspired by the moped gangs that rob places such as the Westfield shopping centre, a sort of Robin Hood tale, but gradually that aspect moved into the background. Instead, he focused on the story of Izi, a loner and long-term Kitchen resident, played by Robinson. As Izi, Robinson conveys a lot with just a facial flicker \u2013 his eyes are especially expressive \u2013 and Kaluuya says, as a director, he really \u201cleaned in\u201d to this subtle performance, \u201ca blink, or a look, those nuances, those details, we took the tone from that\u201d. Such fine-drawn character acting is what Kaluuya loves about British cinema, and he wanted that in The Kitchen, but married to the scale and ambition of a US movie. \u201cI love British film, yes, but we can still be big. My point is: we [can] do what we want. It\u2019s just a story. Everything\u2019s made up. So make it epic, man. Why not?\u201d The epicness in The Kitchen comes especially from the fantastic visuals. The estate itself is like a concrete Brazilian favela: sprawling, rickety, labyrinthine, patched up, with familiar London landmarks such as the Eye seen in the near distance. On the ground, in the Kitchen market, all is neon-lit and buzzing with life. But the flats and upper walkways are wrecked, barricaded, barely functional. And every so often, the estate comes under attack, from an anonymous, shield- and baton-wielding riot police-cum-army. The residents bang pan lids when the attackers arrive, like Belfast wives during the Troubles. Despite such international references, and its heightened, offbeat weirdness, The Kitchen is recognisably set in London. \u201cYeah, it feels like London,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cThe London I grew up in, the confidence and bravado and community and connection between the people\u2026 Usually, when you make a film about an attack, it becomes a film about the attacker, as opposed to the people under attack. What we wanted to explore was those people\u2019s identity and [sense of] community in spite of the attacks.\u201d We see flats on another estate, too: new-built, expensive, sterile. This is the Buena Vida apartment complex. The concierge is a computer. There\u2019s not much of a community. It\u2019s here that Izi aspires to buy, the wipe-clean atmosphere offering a new start. He doesn\u2019t like the Kitchen. He calls it a \u201cshithole\u201d. Actually, Robinson, who thinks hard about the authenticity of his acting, says he struggled a bit with Izi\u2019s attitude. Izi deliberately isolates himself from the community, because he knows he wants to leave. We first see him hogging the only functioning shower, a queue of other residents waiting. \u201cIt was hard to get my head around the way Izi is,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause, in that same scenario, I don\u2019t see myself being the character who would just want to get out, to leave everyone he\u2019s grown up around, who are really fighting for each other, caring for each other. But Izi sees it a completely different way, like: \u2018We\u2019re going to lose. This is my solo mission. I want out.\u2019\u201d The central relationship of the film is between Izi and Benji, played beautifully by newcomer Jedaiah Bannerman, with a young teenager\u2019s heartbreaking mix of defiance and vulnerability. Benji tries to crack Izi\u2019s solo approach and become close to him. A father-son dynamic develops between the pair, and we talk about that. There\u2019s a parallel in the film with Kaluuya\u2019s own background, as his dad was in Uganda until he was 15, and Kaluuya definitely didn\u2019t want to contribute to what he calls the \u201cflattened narrative about black fathers\u201d. \u201cA lot of them just don\u2019t know how [to be fathers],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable thing to talk about, like: \u2018How does someone figure that out?\u2019 They have to process what they haven\u2019t had, or what they haven\u2019t seen. They\u2019re scared to make mistakes, and maybe a lot of the time it\u2019s probably best that some of them aren\u2019t involved in people\u2019s lives. And in the film\u2026 you want to explore the honesty of that. I don\u2019t think the film judges Izi, it just says he\u2019s going through some shit. And he\u2019s doing the best he can.\u201d After they wrapped the main part of the film, a few months later, Robinson and Bannerman had to shoot a couple of significant pick-up scenes. During that time off, Robinson became a father himself. \u201cAnd I just saw it all in a completely different way,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, I don\u2019t think I could ever be like this with my son.\u2019 That super tough love. Knowing you\u2019ve done wrong, but also trying not to show it. But I understand how Izi got to that place.\u201d For much of the film, Izi doesn\u2019t really want to know Benji, so Benji hooks up with a local gang, led by Staples (Hope Ikpoku Jr), whose attitude is the opposite to Izi\u2019s. Staples welcomes Benji into his orphan family crew and urges him to join in their fight to stay in the Kitchen. For Kaluuya and Robinson, this is another of the movie\u2019s most important themes. Are you in or are you out? Do you leave, when you could stay and make it better? \u201cWhy do you want to make it better?\u201d says Kaluuya. \u201cThat\u2019s my thing. I watched all these films about working-class people, and the undercurrent is always, \u2018Where we\u2019re from is shit.\u2019 Like the writer is saying: \u2018I\u2019m really happy that I left. Look at what I left.\u2019 The end point is the leaving, that\u2019s the achievement. So with Izi, instead of his end point being leaving, I was like, how about his start point being \u2018I want to leave\u2019, and explore what kind of man is that. Let him evolve, see what might make him come back. Like The Wizard of Oz, there\u2019s no place like home\u2026\u201d \u201cLiving in London,\u201d says Robinson, \u201cthere\u2019s young boys growing up on the estate, talking about wanting to get out of the ends. That\u2019s all you hear. \u2018I want to get out of the ends. I want to play football and get out of the ends. I want to be a musician and get out of the ends\u2026\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I get it,\u201d says Kaluuya, \u201cwhen people have reasons to leave. But it\u2019s that thing of: \u2018Do you not like what it is? Do you not appreciate the beauty of it, the mindset of where it is and where you\u2019re from and what you\u2019re doing? The connection that you have?\u2019 Why can\u2019t we just be us?\u201d * * * Kaluuya grew up in Camden/Kentish Town, with his Ugandan mum, who works for a special educational needs school, and his older sister. He stayed on his estate, Camelot House, for many years, even after he got successful. He had his own little flat there, and would go and do an acting job, sometimes for months at a time, then come back. But, after a while, he found that this stopped working. Friends kept telling him he shouldn\u2019t stay, that things were different and people were moving on, other people moving in. The bedroom tax meant that families, when their children left home, couldn\u2019t afford to stay in their two- and three-bedroom places. They had to downsize and move out of the estate. And, gradually, he realised that he had to go, too. \u201cI was one of only three people that hadn\u2019t left, because I\u2019d worked hard to stay,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd everyone else had worked hard to leave. And so then it was like, what are you staying for if everyone\u2019s gone? What is your area? Is it the place? Or is it the people? I realised that it was the people. So for me, then there was nothing. But there\u2019s something to that place for a kid that\u2019s there now.\u201d Robinson is from East Ham. He grew up with his Jamaican parents and his brother at 69 Manor Road, as he says in T-Shirt Weather in the Manor; and then 86 St Olaves Road. It\u2019s a small terrace house, with a garden out back, where he spent his teenage years. He remembers it well. \u201cWith the garden, we took the fence away from the middle, between our house and our nextdoor neighbour, Teresa, and [her daughters] Claire and Sarah,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m older, I\u2019ve realised that my mum and Teresa would help each other. So if one didn\u2019t have any money, the other would do the shopping and then we\u2019d share, and then sometimes it\u2019d be vice versa. So they\u2019d come in through the back, get their dinner\u2026 that\u2019s how we worked. That\u2019s how we grew up. And you\u2019ll never see that again, you never have that same relationship with the neighbours and that.\u201d Robinson has long acknowledged how much where he grew up has shaped who he is. Not only in his lyrics, but in his YouTube series, Newham Talks, made during lockdown, where he interviewed other local artists \u2013 mostly grime stars \u2013 about their work. He always discusses their backgrounds, \u201cbecause where I grew up means that much to me,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was in a different business, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have moved.\u201d But, in the end, like Kaluuya, he did move. And many of their friends did too: acting, music and football, the main exit strategies. Partly because those things seemed within reach, but also, \u201cbecause they\u2019re cool, innit!\u201d says Kaluuya. \u201cThey\u2019re the things that you wanna be.\u201d Kaluuya has been acting since he was 13. He was a troublesome kid at school, noisy and clever. Aged nine, he won a playwriting competition and his play was performed at the Hampstead theatre. (The teachers didn\u2019t want him to win, because he was disruptive, but the judges insisted.) Aged 13, he joined Anna Scher theatre school after a plumber told his mum about it. Scher, who started her open-to-all theatre school in 1968, and who only quit teaching in 2020, died last year. Kaluuya says he learned everything from Scher\u2019s Saturday morning acting sessions. Mostly because he\u2019s never had a tougher audience: \u201cEverything was completely improvised, and if you were rubbish, they\u2019d just laugh at you. And if you were boring, then they\u2019re playing Snake [a phone game].\u201d What Kaluuya learned, he says, is that he wasn\u2019t entitled to people\u2019s attention, that he had to give something that was \u201cworthy of someone leaning in, laughing along, listening\u201d. He went to Anna Scher every weekend for three years and realised that \u201cimprov is a way of writing on your feet, creating a story in that moment\u201d. He still uses some of the techniques he learned there. He went to Camden Roundhouse, too, for acting classes, and recently, with others, he\u2019s begun to set up a similar thing for local kids. \u201c\u00a32 classes,\u201d he explains, \u201cbecause a lot of the cheap acting classes that I went to when I was a kid don\u2019t exist any more. And everyone likes to complain and I just don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m like, What are we gonna do about it? So when they said, Do you wanna join the Roundhouse as associate artistic director I said: \u2018Yes, and let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d Still, it\u2019s Anna Scher that was really important to him, and another thing that stays with him from his days there is Scher\u2019s idea of collectivism. She taught the kids that if their friend got a job, then they all got a job, that nobody in the room was competition, even if they were auditioning for the same part. Kaluuya still takes that into his acting: \u201cWhen I come in the game, I come in happy,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, how are we going to make this work? Because if you\u2019re whack, I\u2019m whack. If I\u2019m whack, you\u2019re whack.\u201d Robinson nods. He was a talented footballer when he was young, playing for junior teams at Chelsea and Norwich City before he was 13, but, he says, \u201cthough football is obviously a team game, I really felt like I was more a part of a team with Deja Vu, the pirate radio station. A lot of what you\u2019ve described is the same stuff I experienced through music and pirate radio.\u201d Deja Vu was based on the rooftops of Hackney Wick and brought through many grime and rap artists: Kano, obviously, but also Dizzee Rascal, Ghetts, Tinchy Stryder, Lethal Bizzle and others. Robinson started going there when he was around 15. \u201cIt was the place we all went to express ourselves. Like-minded people, collaboration, back to back, sharing a mic.\u201d The budding rappers would hang out together, go to one another\u2019s houses to write. \u201cJust pushing each other. You\u2019ve got your book, I\u2019ve got my book, we\u2019ve got a beat on, we just sit there and we just write. We could have done it separately, but for some reason, just coming together, not even talking, just coming together, being in the same place, being creative, that was it. We did it all ourselves.\u201d He hadn\u2019t found that in football: \u201cI was decent at it, but the same level of passion wasn\u2019t there.\u201d With music, he woke up thinking about it, and it taught him self-sufficiency: saving money to pay for an hour in a mixing studio, then playing the track out on Deja, and if it worked, maybe pressing a hundred records, taking them to shops, sale or return\u2026 When he talks about this time, he lights up. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cSmall steps.\u201d \u201cMusic has informed how I approach acting,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a writer, I\u2019m not going to leave who I am creatively at the door, just because I\u2019m in another medium. I\u2019m going to approach it in the same way. So I need to understand the world, understand the lines, in order to be able to do it with my whole chest. I need to believe, in order to make you believe.\u201d And music, clearly, is wrapped around both of their lives. When I ask them how they keep in touch, Robinson says that Kaluuya just sends him invites to parties \u2013 \u201cIf I\u2019m about, I\u2019ll go!\u201d Kaluuya rolls his eyes: \u201cIf he\u2019s about\u2026\u201d \u2013 but they also share music. They tell me about Tobe Nwigwe, from Houston, Texas, whose music Kaluuya discovered on Instagram during lockdown. Kaluuya got in touch with him \u2013 of course he did \u2013 and now Nwigwe comes and sees him whenever he\u2019s in London. \u201cHe\u2019s a cool guy\u2026\u201d Music and film and football, a bit, though Robinson doesn\u2019t care about it much any more, and Kaluuya, a huge Arsenal fan, can\u2019t watch matches, because he gets too wound up\u2026 And then the time is up, and they have things to do, and they laugh their way out of the room, which feels frou-frou and curly and quiet and boring, after they leave.

Premiering at a coveted big Saturday night slot, it arrives during a festival that has buyers on high alert, schedules lightened by last year\u2019s strikes pausing production. While the old-fashioned Sundance crowd-pleaser might have become less commercially viable in recent years thanks to both audience and industry shifts (films like Blinded by the Light, Late Night, Brittany Runs a Marathon and Flora and Son going from big sales to little audiences), it still feels like an easy win, easily winning over a packed-out cinema of festival-goers. Set in those emotionally complicated few weeks before the first year of college, My Old Ass centres on Elliott (Maisy Stella), a queer teen living in the idyll of the Muskoka Lakes in Canada (the film doubles up as a persuasive tourism ad). Choosing to spend her remaining days hooking up with a local girl and getting high, she leaves her family to anxiously await her departure alone, believably selfish rather than monstrous teen behaviour. When Elliott takes some mushrooms with her two closest friends, she\u2019s met with her older self (Aubrey Plaza), a head-scratcher that she chalks up to the trip rather than a crack in the the fabric of the universe. But when she returns to the sober light of day, she finds that her future self has left her number in her phone and the two engage in a phone relationship, the older Elliott trying to impart wisdom. Along with the more expected advice about strengthening relationships with the family members she has taken for granted, younger Elliott is told above all else to stay away from Chad, a befuddling priority that becomes impossible when she finally meets him. How could someone so seemingly flawless be such catastrophically bad news? What follows is a shaggy and immensely likeable comedy, playing out as if it were based on a slightly cruder than usual YA novel. The actor turned film-maker Megan Park, acting as both writer and director, smartly makes Elliott\u2019s last few weeks feel refreshingly low-stakes \u2013 she isn\u2019t some hellish teen rampaging against her loving family, but just a slightly thoughtless one in need of only minor tweaks rather than some major makeover. Park\u2019s first movie (the delicate school shooting drama The Fallout) had shown an impressive knack for nailing the specific rhythms of teen speech \u2013 unforced, real and undressed \u2013 and despite subject matter that others either avoid completely or give a pat PSA glow, she found truth in the face of possible cliche. Things are far more heightened here, but Park displays a similar ability to ground material that others would have made impossible to fully believe. As fantastical as things get, she finds a tone that both embraces the goofiness of the setup while also selling us on how real people handle an unreal situation. The life lessons that Park is leading us to are never unexpected \u2013 appreciate the freedom of youth, embrace what mistakes can teach you, be nicer to your parents \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t make them any less effective and as the last act comes into view, Park pushes the film\u2019s sad-around-the-edges melancholy into the spotlight. There\u2019s a surprisingly grand emotional punch, arriving suddenly and landing with force. While it\u2019s pegged to a reveal that we\u2019ve seen before, it\u2019s handled so well that it is impossible not to be moved, a thoughtful reflection on what really constitutes a bad life choice. I\u2019d argue that some of the relationships are a little rushed (the film could have benefitted from a longer runtime, arguably one of the greatest compliments at a time of such bloat), with Elliott\u2019s relationship to her parents in need of a few more beats. A scene between Elliott and her mother (a wonderful Maria Dizzia) is sad and lovely, a familiar wrench of having to let go of someone and allow that relationship to mature and change, but more of that wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. Stella is a sensational find, known mostly for her role in TV\u2019s Nashville, a smart and instinctive young actor with a roughness around the edges that separates her from the slick unnaturalness of the many grown-up Disney kids that act as her industry peers (she\u2019s also a fantastic singer, which leads to a sweet Justin Bieber-inspired sequence). Plaza, who has really found herself as an actor at Sundance delivering her finest, most revealing work in films like Ingrid Goes West and Emily the Criminal, is fantastic \u2013 the kind of A-game performer who really never misses, and the pair have a real, tender rapport. Rather like recent sleeper hit Anyone But You, it also looks as glossy and poppy as a studio comedy from the 2000s, a rich treat at a time when that has become the rare exception rather than the rule. It deserves to find an equally big audience, for asses both young and old.

(Lina stores used to sell the best pandoro ever made, by Brera Milano, but no longer; if anyone sees this for sale LMK.) White chocolate and coffee is satisfyingly sweet and comforting for this time of year. I recently discovered, via a free sample handed out at a Christmas fair, Lindt\u2019s Caramel with a Touch of Sea Salt, \u00a31.95/100g. It\u2019s not super dark, but at 47% cocoa it feels dark and the crunch of caramel gives it some interest. A good one if you are a dark-choc lover, but still need a bit of comfort. And, as we\u2019ve established, that\u2019s everyone at this time of year. Also: Toblerone. Nothing has ever beaten the sensation of locking jaws on one of its duty free-size pieces and, although I find it almost unbearably sweet these days, I do have a bar of its Orange Twist (with ginger), \u00a35/360g, on my desk for moments of gloom. At the other end of the scale for the craft chocolate aficionados, I have a wonderful treat. Table\u2019s Tanzania 72%, \u00a36.50/70g.

Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who became the first black person to win the BBC Young Musician award in 2016, performed as a soloist at the final concert of the annual two-month orchestral event last year \u2013 but said he did not stay to hear Rule, Britannia! being sung at the end of the night.

A corporate gig for a financial reporting company. It was so bad, I was supposed to do 20 minutes but think I did eight. In my defence, it felt like half an hour, so that\u2019s value! I said to them: \u201cI\u2019m going to go, because either I\u2019m a terrible comedian or you\u2019re a terrible audience. I\u2019ve been a comedian for 25 years. How long have you been an audience?\u201d Which I thought was a nice parting dig. Then I went off and the organiser said: \u201cOK, fair enough. But you\u2019ve got to go back on and do the charity auction.\u201d Best heckle? It was in 1997, a hot November night in Sydney, no air in the room. I got nominated for the Perrier with a show called A Night at the Opera, but this night it just wasn\u2019t flying. This woman who was half asleep opened one eye and just went: \u201cBlah, blah, blah.\u201d It was something about the silence with which that was met. Nobody cheered for her but nobody booed either. It just hung in the air. Any preshow rituals? After getting to the venue early for the sound check, I try to find the best pub in the area and order hopefully a pint of something relatively local or relatively interesting. There are some towns in the UK that simply do not have a decent pub to their name and that\u2019s when you get thwarted. What\u2019s your current show, Tragedy Plus Time, about? It is an examination of the idea that comedy can be defined as tragedy plus time, and is done through the examination of a particular tragedy in my life, which happened two years ago, which was the death of my little brother. It sounds pretty depressing, but it\u2019s a very funny show. Does it take a toll talking about something so personal night after night? What\u2019s very weird about it and what I discovered very early on is that I can, if I choose to, almost not listen to myself as I\u2019m talking. On the first three shows I cried every time because the material was new and it was all very emotional for me. One night, the audience didn\u2019t really feel onboard and I didn\u2019t shed one tear. I just did a soulless, emotionless run-through of the show for them. I found that I could, if I needed to, detach myself from the show. But the better the audience, the more emotional I get. Any bugbears from the world of comedy? I am slightly concerned about how polarised the scene is becoming. We seem to be splintering into this weird woke versus anti-woke factionalism that I find quite sad. When I became a comedian, I really felt I\u2019d found my tribe. I enjoyed the camaraderie of comedy and the fact that you can completely disagree with somebody, but we all felt like outsiders and misfits. Now it just feels like a lot of comedians are spending a lot of time talking about what other comedians are doing rather than just trying to be funny. Do you think there\u2019s enough TV opportunities today for new comedians? There was an explosion of panel shows in the 90s that were fairly rubbish. It became slightly over-saturated, and they became a byword for crap light entertainment television. Then when Mock the Week and 8 Out of 10 Cats came along, it really hit that the panel show was the most efficient comedy delivery system. Before Live at the Apollo, there was still the idea that standup didn\u2019t really work on mainstream TV and that the panel show was the best way to get comedians on TV and have them be funny. I\u2019ve been in the industry so long there\u2019s no point asking me what my advice is for young comedians. I think apart from Taskmaster, there isn\u2019t a show any more that can make a career in the old way that TV used to, so everybody\u2019s moving online. I\u2019m doing it myself. I\u2019ve paid a woman 20 years younger than me to chop up my old DVDs and stick them out on Instagram and TikTok in 30-second chunks. Worst advice you\u2019ve ever been given? Early on, when I was on the dole, I was disappointed to not get to the final of So You Think You\u2019re Funny. People were so philosophical: \u201cYou\u2019re young. It\u2019s all ahead of you. Enjoy the journey.\u201d But I was fucking broke. I wanted to work and thought: I\u2019ll enjoy the journey after I start making a living. I did enjoy it eventually, but at the time that was not useful advice. Best advice you\u2019ve ever been given? Talk less. Comedy is a people business and you do well to not annoy other people. \u2022 Ed Byrne: Tragedy Plus Time is on tour", "date": "2024-01-22", "section": "Stage", "author": "Interview by Liam Pape", "id": 581, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ec590a7cd7d254277253f2337cae52b5b8856085/0_249_1500_900/500.jpg"}, {"title": "\u2018I said: enough of the shame!\u2019: how Johannes Radebe fought the bullies \u2013 and became a Strictly superstar", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/22/enough-shame-johannes-radebe-fought-bullies-strictly-superstar", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.132, "neu": 0.658, "pos": 0.21, "compound": 0.9987}, "body": "If you watched Strictly Come Dancing in 2018, chances are Johannes Radebe caught your eye. He wasn\u2019t yet known, but, through the group dances performed by the professionals, it became clear that Radebe was a star who couldn\u2019t be contained for long. A year later, he was given his first celebrity partner (the actor Catherine Tyldesley) and performed the series\u2019 first same-sex dance \u2013 in heels, no less \u2013 with his fellow dancer Graziano Di Prima. Vogueing in black stilettos alongside Di Prima felt like \u201cmy coming-out party\u201d, he says: \u201cThere was something very empowering about saying: this is who I am. I said to myself: enough of the shame, enough of hiding, just enough.\u201d By 2021, when he was dancing with the baker John Whaite as one half of the show\u2019s first male couple, Radebe had become one of Strictly\u2019s most beloved stars. Leaving aside his stage outfits \u2013 a green beaded jumpsuit was a highlight in the most recent series \u2013 Radebe has been known to step out in heels and a ballgown for special occasions, such as when Strictly picked up a National Television award last year. Today, though, he is dressed in sportswear, a big quilted coat protecting him from the cold. A few days ago, Radebe, who is South African, took the Life in the UK test in preparation to settle here. It was hard, he says, but he passed. \u201cI got out of there thinking I might be deported,\u201d he says, smiling. With the test \u2013 and the months of studying \u2013 over, Radebe has thrown himself into creating his third dance show, House of Jojo, which begins its UK tour at the end of March. It\u2019s a stretch to say that a piece of immigration bureaucracy inspired the show, but it made him wonder about the overlaps. What is the history of House of Jojo? What are its values? \u201cI really want it to reflect the world I live in,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have been given opportunities by coming to this country. It is made up of a lot of people that come from outside. As long as you obey the law, you\u2019re guaranteed democracy and freedom. There is space to exist.\u201d Radebe is the draw, of course, but House of Jojo is about bringing others along. He has assembled a diverse cast of dancers, including some from places where it\u2019s hard to get a UK visa. Others have been denied opportunities in the past because they don\u2019t fit the traditional idea of how a dancer should look. \u201cIt\u2019s been a beautiful process, because I\u2019m not alone during this,\u201d he says of his creative team. Radebe says he wouldn\u2019t be where he is without the people who helped him: his local community, which chipped in for transport to dance competitions; his coaches, who spent hours nurturing him; the power brokers who gave him chances once his career was quickstepping along. \u201cI\u2019m not blind to the fact that it was everybody\u2019s effort,\u201d he says. Radebe grew up in Zamdela, a mining township in the Free State, in the final years of apartheid. He was too young to be much aware of it; he didn\u2019t question why, when driving through white suburbs in a minibus on the way to church, some people had huge houses and swimming pools behind barbed-wire fences, while his family lived in a small bungalow, in which he shared a room with his older sister and his grandmother. \u201cYou just think: \u2018This is where I come from and this is where they come from,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cNow, understanding the fear \u2013 to know that our parents lived in fear while they were raising kids \u2013 that still affects our society. There\u2019s a gap that needs to be bridged \u2013 and soon, because it\u2019s dire what\u2019s happening to youngsters in South Africa. So, have I experienced apartheid? No, but do I know the effects of it? I see them every day.\u201d As a child, did he know he was different from other boys? \u201cFrom the start,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cIn terms of mannerisms, things I was interested in \u2013 Barbies were my thing.\u201d He loved to make clothes for his sister\u2019s dolls and dress them; when his father, who worked for Coca-Cola, gave the children money to spend in a shop, Radebe chose his own doll. When his parents discovered this, it was met with silence, but not shaming. That came when Radebe started school. He was marked out as a \u201csissy boy\u201d. Sometimes, he would be chased home by boys and threatened with violence. Even adults would verbally abuse him. \u201cConservative beliefs,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018An African is an African and a man is a man.\u2019 That is my Zulu uncles talking.\u201d Later, they would constantly ask him when he would find a wife: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThose were daily conversations.\u201d There were glimmers of light \u2013 his mother was supportive and he made friends with two other boys who were going through the same thing. But mostly it was about survival: \u201cI used to hide a lot. I would run away from anything threatening.\u201d He felt relaxed with his sister or his friends around, \u201cbut the minute people disappeared, I never felt safe\u201d. It must have been frightening, I say. \u201cFrightening, yes,\u201d he says, softly. One of his friends was beaten up so badly, after being spotted playing with dolls with Radebe, that he missed school. It is no exaggeration to say that dance saved Radebe. He stumbled into a class at the local recreation hall by accident when he was seven, and fell in love. It rebuilt his self-esteem and confidence and his growing reputation as a dancer offered a level of protection from his attackers. It also provided an outlet when his family life fell apart and his parents separated. Radebe says it gave him \u201ca sense of belonging, a sense of worth. To get applause made me feel like somebody, for however long it lasted. I knew there was a world where I didn\u2019t have to feel ashamed, because people understood where I came from. When I went back into the real world, everything seemed so bland. That dance world was sparkly, kind, it was accommodating.\u201d Radebe started competing in Latin and ballroom competitions, raising money from neighbours to pay for transport and accommodation. His world was opening, but so were his eyes. It was the first time he really saw the inequalities of race and class. Competitions weren\u2019t based on talent alone; grooming and presentation were vital. The couples with better, more expensive costumes \u2013 almost always white \u2013 would take the top prizes. He remembers, after coming fourth, asking one of the judges for advice on how he and his partner might improve. \u201cI remember him saying: \u2018You will never win. Look at you, you look unkempt.\u2019 And to my partner: \u2018Your body type is wrong for this dance.\u2019\u201d As one of the top couples in their province, Radebe and his partner had been invited to compete internationally, but that was financially impossible. Some rival couples paid for private tuition with adjudicators before competitions, but that wasn\u2019t an option. It felt as though kids from townships could never win. \u201cIf I had to dwell on that, I wouldn\u2019t have survived this industry or this world,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is why there\u2019s so few of us. But it was painful. There\u2019s a million times when I felt: why am I even trying?\u201d They were often the only Black couple to make the finals. \u201cMy coach used to say: \u2018Listen to the audience; they will let you know whether you won or not.\u2019\u201d Radebe and his partner would get the loudest cheers, but not the highest scores. His partner walked away. \u201cShe said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this, it\u2019s not fun.\u2019 I was stupid enough to hold on, because I didn\u2019t know what to do without this.\u201d He laughs, but he is downplaying his determination. Was he always so strong? He takes a long pause. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve had people that loved me hard, that showed me that whatever I wanted in life, I could achieve, and that\u2019s what got me through it,\u201d he says. It was partly about being young in the nascent post-apartheid era. He was constantly told how lucky he was: \u201cYou were reminded with breakfast, lunch and dinner, every time your mother had an opportunity to remind you that you have been afforded an opportunity to make something of your life.\u201d Did it feel like pressure, or empowering? \u201cIt felt both \u2013 and it left a lot of people crippled. I look at my own family and the lack of education, lack of opportunity, has led to a desperation in people. It does boil down to you as an individual to make a choice, that I\u2019m not going to accept what has been dealt to me. There are people that have risen above that and there are people that haven\u2019t been able to.\u201d Radebe\u2019s mother was persuaded to let him leave home at 13 and move in with a dance coach couple in a different province; they had spotted his potential and could offer him bigger opportunities in nearby Johannesburg. He hoped going to a new school would be better, but the homophobic bullying was worse. \u201cI was trying to stand my ground and stand up to my bullies, but I would be bashed,\u201d he says. Once, he was viciously attacked in the school toilets by a group of boys. On the day of his final exam, he remembers telling himself that he never had to return. \u201cI wanted to leave that world far behind. And I have.\u201d He was cast in a stage show, then became a dance teacher in Johannesburg, but he was earning so little that he couldn\u2019t afford an apartment. Instead, he would pay friendly taxi drivers a small amount to sleep in the back of their cabs, or he would secretly stay overnight in the dance studio. Going to gay clubs, Radebe became aware that there was often a transactional relationship between older white men and young Black men. Sometimes, he would ask to stay in a spare room, but made it clear there would be nothing in it for them; often, they let him. When one of these men tried to sexually assault him, Radebe escaped. His life, he decided, had become too unstable and dangerous. A friend encouraged him to audition for a job as a dancer on cruise ships; he spent the next seven years performing. Then he was cast in South Africa\u2019s version of Strictly, but couldn\u2019t let go of the fact that he hadn\u2019t yet won a South African dance title. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let those adjudicators tell me that I was never going to win. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. I won the [national Latin] title, not once, but twice.\u201d He smiles. As the reigning champion, he fired off a confident email to the producers of Burn the Floor, a successful ballroom and Latin show of which he was desperate to be a part. Touring with that show, he caught the eye of the producers of British Strictly and was asked to join the cast. Being invited on to the original show felt like validation: \u201cIt felt like I was being rewarded for sticking it out.\u201d It has changed his life, he says, and his family\u2019s life. \u201cI know that my family is OK and that is what I\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d he says. Radebe\u2019s father died when he was a teenager; he has always considered himself his family\u2019s breadwinner. Recently, he was able to build his mother a house. It had always been his dream to dance with another man. When he started dancing at seven, he asked if he could dance with a boy and was told no. \u201cYou can imagine what it did for my shame, thinking that I always had to hide that about me. I\u2019ve always asked myself: what would that feel like? The fact that we got to do it, I knew how many people would have looked at that moment and felt seen.\u201d In the 2021 series, he and Whaite \u2013 not only the first male couple, but also the first gay partnership \u2013 reached the final. In any other year, they would have won (they were beaten by the luminous Rose Ayling-Ellis). I challenge anyone to watch their last dance, completely joyful and free, and not well up. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what that has done for so many people, and I hear the stories still today,\u201d says Radebe. \u201cThat\u2019s how I know that we\u2019ve left the world a better place, just by doing what we do. It\u2019s humbling, and it feels great to be part of history in that regard. I would have loved to exist in a world where I didn\u2019t have to be ashamed of myself. There was never anything wrong with me, yet the society around me made me believe there was.\u201d To have such support from the public felt like \u201ca hug\u201d, he says. \u201cAfter that you couldn\u2019t touch me. I can\u2019t tell you what it did for my confidence. Thanks to John, as well. My relationships have changed since then with people in my life that are close to me.\u201d His uncles stopped asking when he would be finding a wife. This isn\u2019t to say it has been easy. He is careful now with social media, because the abuse got so bad: \u201cPeople would tell me and John that we were disgusting, that I should never come back to Africa, that I\u2019m a disgrace.\u201d He has learned not to engage and to try to ignore it. \u201cI\u2019ve created a world where that has no impact on me any more. It\u2019s not me that has a problem. If they\u2019re willing to learn, come to House of Jojo; I\u2019ll educate you. What I do, and how I live my life, can never be based on what other people think. I want to create a world that I see in my head \u2013 and it\u2019s of love and of kindness.\u201d Later, I spend a lovely afternoon rewatching clips of Radebe dancing \u2013 it\u2019s a strange alchemy of precision, energy and lightness \u2013 but mostly I think about the little boy, bullied, ashamed and disadvantaged, who just kept going. \u201cHonestly, never in my wildest dreams,\u201d he had said earlier, about his career. None of it was planned and there were plenty of people who told him he would never make it. \u201cI pinch myself, because I\u2019m like: how? But I\u2019ve got incredible people that hold me up. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve survived. It was never about money, it was never about being known.

Researchers at the LSE interviewed 35 members of the UK\u2019s richest 1% \u2013 by wealth or income \u2013 and found that none said they would leave the UK for tax reasons. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to a tax haven.

So no, I wouldn\u2019t leave for that kind of reason \u2026 I want to live in a vibrant economic climate where there\u2019s room for innovation and, you know, people are inventing, and I think London is like that.\u201d Another respondent, Luke, who works in law, said: \u201cI have a nice life here [in London]. My clients who moved to the Bahamas were bored to death. Sun, sea and sand. OK, it\u2019s great for a couple of weeks to charge the batteries, but after a while you think, \u2018Well, I\u2019d quite like to go and watch an opera.\u2019 Well, you can forget that \u2013 there\u2019s not a theatre in the Bahamas.\u201d Bea and Peter, a couple who both work in finance, said that if they \u201cmove to the Middle East, [you] are in gated communities and stuff like that. I never found that attractive in any way.\u201d Marianne, who works in culture, said the suggestion that there would be a \u201cbig brain drain\u201d if the government introduced higher taxes on the wealthy was \u201ccomplete nonsense. And I will give you the answer why in two words, and that is National Gallery or National Theatre \u2026 that\u2019s why people aren\u2019t going to leave London.\u201d The research by the International Inequalities Institute at the LSE found that the super-rich feared the societal \u201cstigma attached to tax migration\u201d. \u201cInterviewees were disparaging about those who chose to move for tax purposes,\u201d the research paper said. \u201cSome judged tax migrants on moral grounds as unduly economically self-interested, while others expressed a snobbery about tax-advantageous destinations as boring and culturally barren.\u201d The research comes as public and political debate focuses on tax ahead of the general election expected later this year. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, last week indicated that there may be big tax cuts in his March budget, in what was seen as one of the last opportunities for the Conservatives to claw back Labour\u2019s lead in the opinion polls. \u201cI believe fundamentally that low-tax economies are more dynamic, more competitive,\u201d he said. Hunt has come under pressure to cut taxes amid forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility that they are heading for their highest level since the 1940s. Meanwhile, trade unions, the Green party and some members of the super-rich have called for the introduction of wealth taxes to help pay for battered public services. A \u201cmodest\u201d 1.7% wealth tax on the richest 140,000 people in the UK could raise more than \u00a310bn to help pay for public services, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggested last year, but Labour and the Liberal Democrats have ruled out introducing such a tax. While none of the super-rich people interviewed for the paper, entitled Tax Flight?, Britain\u2019s Wealthiest and Their Attachment to Place, said they were planning to leave over tax, many said they were concerned that the top tax rates in the UK were currently too high and would rise further. \u201cA minority of interviewees said they would not rule out tax migration, but only if the political and economic conditions in Britain changed dramatically,\u201d the paper said. \u201cA return to top tax rates seen in the 1970s or a Jeremy Corbyn-style government were frequently cited as \u2018red-line\u2019 conditions.\u201d Sam Friedman, professor of sociology at LSE and lead author of the research, said: \u201cWe need to challenge the prevailing assumption that if you tax the rich, they will leave. \u201cThe rich are not only strongly embedded, but they are also acutely aware of the stigma of tax migration \u2013 of being seen as unduly self-interested or moving to places others consider culturally barren and boring.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-22", "section": "Money", "author": "Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent", "id": 583, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2b53494f79f595dbd3e3226cffe536ba95503a0a/0_118_3500_2100/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Albanese fuels cost-of-living relief expectations as MPs debate sticking with stage-three tax cuts", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/22/anthony-albanese-labor-government-cost-of-living-relief-updates-policy-stage-three-tax-cuts", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.121, "neu": 0.675, "pos": 0.204, "compound": 0.9954}, "body": "Anthony Albanese has continued to raise expectations of further cost-of-living relief as some backbench MPs debate the possibility Labor could modify stage-three income tax cuts to pay for new measures. On Monday the prime minister said \u201cif we can find ways to put extra dollars in people\u2019s pockets, particularly those low and middle income earners who are doing it tough, then we\u2019re prepared to do so\u201d. Albanese confirmed that by Wednesday\u2019s caucus meeting the government will have received advice about \u201chow we can take pressure off cost of living\u201d, reiterating that it had \u201calways said that will continue to look for ways to assist people\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working away throughout January and what we\u2019ll be looking at [on Wednesday], of course, is the advice that we\u2019ve received about how we can take pressure off cost of living,\u201d Albanese told Sky News. While backbench MPs are pleased at the renewed focus on the cost of living for low and middle income earners, Labor is divided between those who want to see a renovation of stage-three tax cuts to improve fairness and those who warn this would arm Peter Dutton with a potent argument that the government has breached an election promise. The tax cuts, passed by the Morrison government in mid-2019 with Labor support after it failed to split the bill, begin in July 2024. They remove the $120,000 to $180,000 tax bracket, increase the top tax bracket to $200,000 and reduce the marginal rate of tax for everyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000 to 30%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The stage-three tax cuts reduce tax revenue by $320bn over 10 years, and could be renovated to save the budget up to $130bn while still delivering bigger tax cuts to 80% of income earners, according to the Australia Institute. On Monday 2GB Radio reported that the government is considering increasing the tax free threshold to benefit low and middle income earners, and making the stage three cuts less generous for high income earners by retaining the $180,000 threshold for the top bracket. A government spokesperson said \u201cthe government\u2019s plans have not changed\u201d. On Wednesday Albanese said that \u201ctax cuts will happen in July\u201d but did not specifically recommit to stage-three, instead observing that \u201cat the moment, these cuts cut in at $45,000\u201d. One Labor MP said although they didn\u2019t think it was in Australia\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d to have committed to tax cuts, which predominantly benefit high income earners, before the election, \u201cwe\u2019ll never hear the end of it\u201d if Labor breaks its promise. The MP said the government should \u201cstick to what we said we\u2019d do\u201d, although it might be possible to cut out the \u201ctop one or 2% of income earners who don\u2019t need it\u201d. \u201cThe average person wouldn\u2019t complain about that,\u201d the MP said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how brave we\u2019ll be \u2013 we\u2019ll find out on Wednesday.\u201d Others were more adamant that any modification on stage-three would be electorally costly \u2013 particularly if it turned the 2 March Dunkley byelection and 2025 federal election into referendums on deviating from repeated promises to maintain the cuts. Another MP said it was \u201cproblematic\u201d to see \u201ceverything through the prism frozen in time\u201d at the point the cuts were passed because \u201cthe world is changing so rapidly\u201d. \u201cSurely there is capacity for a sensible government to tweak the tax cuts appropriately,\u201d the MP said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who need it more than income earners on politicians\u2019 wages.\u201d Labor would probably not need Coalition support to amend stage-three tax cuts, given the Greens and key crossbench senators Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock have all called for them to be reformed. But on Thursday, Dutton, the opposition leader, warned that Albanese\u2019s leadership would be \u201cover if he abandons the stage-three tax cuts because Australians have seen this movie before and they don\u2019t reward leaders who go to an election with an ironclad guarantee, and then knowingly break it\u201d. \u201cThere will be a lot of people who make the application to the bank at the moment, maybe to refinance, try and lock in a lower interest rate over the next couple of years if they can find one, and they will be relying on that additional income coming into their budget,\u201d Dutton told 2GB Radio. Labor MP Brian Mitchell, who pushed the treasurer Jim Chalmers to speak to backbenchers about the rising cost of living back in November, is one of a number of MPs who want more done for middle income earners. Mitchell said Labor had done \u201cdone well for those on low incomes and concession card holders\u201d who benefited from energy relief, but that people \u201care being squeezed in the middle\u201d. Labor MP Maria Vamvakinou said changes like an increase in jobseeker and rent assistance would be \u201cuseful and relevant to middle Australia and lower [socioeconomic status] households\u201d. \u201cI do have renters in my electorate but a large part of households are in newly acquired homes.

An extension of energy price relief passed in December 2022, which included caps on coal prices and rebates for some consumers, is considered among the measures most likely to be adopted to help households. The energy bill relief remains a popular move among Labor MPs, but several claimed voters were not necessarily giving major credit to the government for that change, since the help reduces bills before they reach the consumer.

If the soul immortal be, Is not its love immortal too? Seest thou my home? \u2014 \u2019Tis where yon woods are waving In their dark richness, to the sunny air: Where yon blue stream, a thousand flower-banks laving, Leads down the hills a vein of light \u2014 \u2019tis there! Midst these green haunts how many a spring lies gleaming, Fringed with the violet, coloured with the skies, My boyhood\u2019s haunt, through days of summer dreaming, Under young leaves that shook with melodies! My home! \u2014 the spirit of its love is breathing In every wind that plays upon my track, From its white walls the very tendrils wreathing Seem with soft links to draw the wanderer back. There am I loved \u2014 there prayed for! \u2014 there my mother Sits by the hearth with meekly thoughtful eye, There my young sisters watch to greet their brother; Soon their glad footsteps down the path will fly! There, in sweet strains of kindred music blending, All the home-voices meet at day\u2019s decline; One are those tones, as from one heart descending \u2014 there laughs my home. Sad stranger! where is thine? \u2014 Ask\u2019st thou of mine? \u2014 in solemn peace \u2018tis lying Far o\u2019er the deserts and the tombs away; \u2019Tis where I too am loved, with love undying, And fond hearts wait my step \u2014 But where are they? And where the earth\u2019s departed have their dwelling, Ask of the clouds, the stars, the trackless air! \u2013 I know it not \u2014 yet trust the whisper, telling My lonely heart, that love unchanged is there. And what is home, and where, but with the loving? Happy thou art, that so canst gaze on thine! My spirit feels, but in its weary roving, There with the dead, where\u2019er they be, is mine. Go to thy home, rejoicing son and brother! Bear in fresh gladness to the household scene! For me, too, watch the sister and the mother, I will believe \u2014 but dark seas roll between. This return-visit to the work of Felicia Dorothea Hemans (1793-1835) highlights a less familiar poem than the previous choice Casabianca. The Two Homes, first published in Songs of the Affections (1830) doesn\u2019t initially declare its form as dialogue. It appears that Hemans, in typical Romantic style, is addressing her readers with her delight in the inextricability of home and nature. From the first verse I\u2019d single out the images of the woods \u201cwaving / in their dark richness\u201d and the stream as \u201ca vein of light\u201d as most distinctive. The second verse suggests multiple rivulets (\u201cmany a spring\u201d), so the setting is easily imagined as a hill in Hemans\u2019s \u201cadopted\u201d north Wales. There\u2019s fresh surprise in verse two, which reveals the speaker to be male. From \u201cboyhood\u2019s haunt\u201d the description moves naturally to the home itself, the white-washed exterior whose tendrils \u201cseem with soft links to draw the wanderer back\u201d. These tendrils aren\u2019t explained: shorn of specific detail, the word works on the reader\u2019s imagination. I thought first of the vines in Keats\u2019s ode To Autumn. The domestic scene is captured well, if predictably, in verse four. The next adds a fresher dimension. The \u201chome-voices\u201d (an appealing coinage) are metaphorical music (and they might become actual music, if the sisters add singing to the evening\u2019s entertainment). Family harmony, whether spoken or sung, lulls the speaker into further delight: \u201cThere laughs my home.\u201d But this is the signal for a re-focus. Another presence is declared, in a deft act of poetic and conversational timing provoked by the word home: \u201cSad stranger! where is thine?\u201d Hemans brings this second speaker poignantly into view. The emphasis (\u201cAsk\u2019st thou of mine?\u201d), echoing the earlier \u201cthine\u201d, makes us wait, fills the pause with questioning anticipation. That the stranger\u2019s family is dead becomes swiftly apparent: the phrase \u201csolemn peace\u201d can imply nothing else. But the mystery lingers for the reader. Where are the physical remains located? Where is the stranger from? The distance evoked (\u201co\u2019er the deserts and the tombs away\u201d) implies not only the distance between death and life. It suggests the stranger has travelled far. We\u2019re not told the gender, but the poem\u2019s underlying realism favours a male, perhaps a homeless ex-soldier or other recognisable migrant. The remainder of the poem holds in balance the migrant\u2019s sense that the lost loved ones are still intensely present, and that, at the same time, he\u2019s disturbed because they cannot be located somewhere other than \u201cthe clouds, the stars, the trackless air\u201d. Resisting closure while returning to the A rhymes of verse four, but in reverse order (\u201cmother/brother\u201d becomes \u201cbrother/mother\u201d) Hemans adheres stringently to her \u201cplot\u201d, the contrast between the two experiences. The stranger utters a generous blessing to his interlocutor. He asserts the determination to believe in his family\u2019s watchful love. And then, immediately, death becomes intractable: \u201cbut dark seas roll between.\u201d Hemans builds The Two Homes from some fundamental imaginative resources. Her family moved from Liverpool to Gwrych, near Abergele, north Wales, in 1800, and she considered herself to be Welsh by adoption. After her marriage in 1812 she lived and raised five children in Wales, and remained there after her subsequent divorce, although she moved back to Liverpool after her mother\u2019s death in 1827, and ended her days in Dublin. While she is attracted to themes of female attainment and self-sacrifice, family life, as here, has transcendent status in her poetry, and finding it is rarely straightforward. The Two Homes begins with an epigraph from Song (\u201cFond dreams of love by love repaid\u201d) by the abolitionist Norwich poet, Amelia Opie. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t been able to track down the text of Song. Another interesting comparison is suggested by Richard Rutherford Johnston in Chapter 3 of his thesis, Romanticism and Mortal Consciousness, where he suggests that The Two Homes is a response to Wordsworth\u2019s poem We Are Seven.", "date": "2024-01-22", "section": "Books", "author": "Carol Rumens", "id": 585, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/504d0cf79762ecf9cd2e077298b1c7f9902915e8/0_0_5175_3105/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Gordon Burn prize announces \u2018blazing\u2019 shortlist", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/25/gordon-burn-prize-announces-electric-shortlist", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.133, "neu": 0.659, "pos": 0.208, "compound": 0.9747}, "body": "Booker-shortlisted author Jonathan Escoffery and Guardian Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll and are among those shortlisted for this year\u2019s Gordon Burn prize, which aims to champion the year\u2019s \u201cboldest and most innovative\u201d books. Novels, short stories, memoirs and history books appear on the list, with stories that range from the IRA\u2019s efforts to kill Margaret Thatcher to an Inuk girl growing up in the Arctic. The shortlist features seven titles for the first time \u2013 in previous years, there have been five or six finalists. \u201cSeven books on the shortlist?

The 53-year-old says this specific detail \u201cseemed to spark interest rather than resistance\u201d. The book, Lioness, tells the story of a self-styled, luxury guru who faces midlife reckoning amid whispers of fraud, and a new friendship with her charismatic neighbour. \u201cThere was absolute openness about something that was set in Wellington,\u201d she says. Perkins\u2019 experience marks a growing interest in New Zealand fiction from readers around the word. It comes 10 years after one the country\u2019s most acclaimed writers, Eleanor Catton, became the youngest winner of the Booker prize for her novel The Luminaries. Academics and publishers say New Zealand writers are booming overseas, yet some authors hold concerns for the future of the industry and funding for the creative sector after the centre-right coalition government took power in October 2023. Last year saw a string of globally successful releases from emerging and established New Zealand authors, including Catherine Chidgey, Anna Smaill and Perkins. #BookTok star Chloe Gong shot to the New York Times bestseller list with her new fantasy novella. Catton\u2019s latest book, Birnam Wood, secured spots on bestseller lists in the US and the UK. The novel was shortlisted for several UK awards. Chidgey and Catton have also been nominated for the 2024 Dublin literary prize. Breaking into new markets Tina Makereti, author and senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington says there is a \u201cboom of New Zealand writers being published overseas\u201d, including the US, UK and Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to break into those markets, and I think that\u2019s changed,\u201d Makereti says, citing the recent success of writers such as Tayi Tibble \u2013 who last year became the first M\u0101ori poet published in The New Yorker \u2013 and Perkins. The sentiment is echoed by Noel Murphy, commercial director at Granta Publications, which publishes Catton. He says New Zealand authors are making inroads in countries around the world. \u201cAll of a sudden, there are a bunch of New Zealand writers on their way into the European market in a way that probably hasn\u2019t been the case before,\u201d Murphy says. Makereti says international publishers are choosing writing that is \u201cvery New Zealand\u201d. She says after Covid, borders have become less limiting, and the star power of former prime minister Jacinda Ardern has also helped. \u201cNew Zealand is readily identifiable because of Jacinda,\u201d she says. \u2018Living on the fringes\u2019 While the success is growing, writers are split on the appeal of the work coming out of New Zealand \u2013 or whether there\u2019s a commonality at all. Murphy says over the last few years, reader appetite has shifted \u201caway from middle-class people worrying about getting divorced\u201d and towards \u201cdark, slightly unusual stories on the edge, which border on horror\u201d. Chidgey says New Zealand authors \u201cseem to write from the point of view of the outsider, from someone living on the fringes\u201d. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s maybe geographical \u2013 we do live on the fringes of the world.\u201d Wellington-based Smaill released her third novel Bird Life last year. The author, who was longlisted for the Booker prize in 2015, says there\u2019s \u201ca kind of a privilege to the isolation\u201d. \u201cWhen there are fewer people, it forces a kind of independence of mind where you don\u2019t inherit easy answers to things,\u201d Smaill says. \u201cI do think the \u2018Kiwi ingenuity\u2019 is a thing. There\u2019s a self-reliance that is a creative mode to fall back on,\u201d she says. Perkins stresses that just as there is no all-encapsulating style of New Zealand fiction, nor is there one clear reason for its recent popularity. \u201cThe more there is, the more variety you see \u2013 and the more pointless it becomes to try to define it in any one way,\u201d says the writer, who was longlisted for the Women\u2019s prize for fiction. \u201cIt could be a big thing like Jacinda or it could be a more conceptual thing like the colonial reckoning, or it could be down to a few people.\u201d Funding fears Despite the recent success, some hold concern over future support for creative industries in New Zealand, with arts groups saying the sector is starved of adequate funding. There is little to suggest the new National-led government will prioritise support for the sector. The National party did not have an arts policy in the lead-up to the 2023 election, nor were arts and culture mentioned in its coalition deals with minor parties Act and New Zealand First. Speaking to broadcaster RNZ in December, the new minister for arts, culture and heritage, Paul Goldsmith, said funding for the creative sector would be squeezed in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m taking stock of where we\u2019re at, we\u2019re obviously arriving at a time when there\u2019s not large amounts of money sloshing around, or free money, or extra money to come \u2013 so it\u2019s going to be tight.\u201d Creative New Zealand \u2013 the national arts development agency that funds artist projects \u2013 receives a baseline sum of just over NZ$16m a year from the government, which has barely shifted since 2006. The agency gets another 70% of its funding via the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board, which is now under threat due to proposed changes in the way the board allocates money. Creative NZ has warned it is operating at $5m less, going into 2024, than the previous year. Despite international praise and sales of New Zealand authors, the funding that helped give rise rise to its current vanguard has been eroded. Smaill says the government led by Helen Clark, in the early 2000s, was supportive of writers. \u201cFor me, and for many other writers I know, a far more significant and measurable impact was the support provided by the Clark government,\u201d Smaill says. The author says a funding scheme for creatives, dubbed the artists\u2019 dole, was a \u201chuge enabler of my writing career\u201d. \u201cIt gave me the freedom to focus on writing for a year following my master\u2019s and was pivotal in getting my first book published.

If you have darker spots, melasma, rosacea, blotchiness, mild birthmarks or scarring that you\u2019re not happy about, please, regardless of your skin tone, dispense with preconceptions about fake tan and make friends with facial tanning drops. During a recent meeting with the brilliant consultant dermatologist Emma Craythorne, I showed her some old photographs of my once-extreme melasma (large brown patches often triggered by hormonal changes), before and after I\u2019d applied self-tan on the surrounding areas only (covering the dark patches with lighter concealer just turns them grey; levelling up the paler areas works miles better). She was so impressed by the dramatic effects of such a simple, fast and somewhat half-arsed method that she now recommends it to her patients. Shortly afterwards, I had a similar conversation with the esteemed beauty editor Eve Cameron, who told me she\u2019d managed the appearance of the once-problematic acne she\u2019d suffered in her youth by bronzing her face artificially, thus neutralising the angry-looking redness and evening out her overall skin tone. I then gave a girlfriend some St Tropez Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops (\u00a324) to apply over her menopause-triggered rosacea while her doctor-prescribed skincare got to work, and their effects have helped lift the dip in her confidence. Likewise, if you\u2019re a person with an illness that has dulled your skin and robbed you of the time or inclination to wear makeup, facial self-tan is a low-effort way to restore a healthier-looking glow to skin of any colour. Tan Luxe Super Glow (\u00a323.35), Beauty Pie Awesome Bronze (\u00a312.50 to members) and M&amp;S Autograph Self Tan Luxe Facial Oil (\u00a39.50) are similarly great and effective.

Self-tan does nothing to fix underlying skin issues \u2013 the joy is in the speed and exceptional ease of application: just add a few drops to your usual moisturiser and mix, or apply the drops alone like a serum (if you have highlights, wear a headband for either, to avoid staining) you will enjoy a good two to three days of not having to think so much about concealing and covering areas that would otherwise stand out and cause stress.", "date": "2024-01-26", "section": "Fashion", "author": "Sali Hughes", "id": 589, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/62aa820d49b9c66b3f78643133637bc1bea964da/200_0_5724_3435/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Northanger Abbey review \u2013 Janeites, be warned!

So it is both fun and appropriate to see her early novel given a fanfic makeover by Zoe Cooper of the sort that has previously seen Harry Potter copping off with Ron Weasley. Janeites, be warned. The first act of this three-hander is a delight, tracking the progress of the breathy young northerner Cath, from her birth in a hard-pressed household, overburdened with babies, to the dizzy social whirl of Bath, where she is whisked by childless friends of the family, with only her intimate knowledge of gothic literature to guide her through the baffling social hierarchies. There she meets the free-spirited and charismatic Iz and Hen, handsome heir to a leaky and undoubtedly haunted castle. The physical storytelling of Tessa Walker\u2019s production is clear and hilarious, building a world from a few pieces of furniture. A pile of old trunks serves as the coach and horses with which Iz\u2019s boneheaded brother nearly gallops Cath to her death, and a dressing-up box, from which emerge scraps of character, including a regimental jacket that is tossed between Cath, Hen and Iz to populate ballrooms and streets with predatory men. The problems emerge in the second act, where a tricksy chronology becomes too clever by half, so you are never quite sure if you are in Austen\u2019s head or Cooper\u2019s. Given that Isabella Thorpe is one of the novel\u2019s great disappointments, who disappears off to richer pastures halfway through it, the romance between Iz and Cath cannot resolve, with the result that the story sputters out like a damp candle on a staircase to nowhere. But there is no faulting the cast. Rebecca Banatvala creates a Cath who fizzes with bright-eyed, charismatic ardour; AK Golding\u2019s Iz has a truly Austenite satirical edge, which makes a mockery of her harrumphing men, even as she conjures them bodily out of thin air; Sam Newton\u2019s honest-to-goodness Hen holds the important line between dignity and send-up from his first appearance as Cath\u2019s labouring mum, giving birth to a large bolster cushion on a mothy chaise longue.

Her sister, the actor Ciara Baxendale, known for playing Izzy in E4\u2019s My Mad Fat Diary, paid tribute on Instagram, describing \u00d3rla as radiant and a dreamer who was cherished by everyone. \u201cI will never ever, as long as I am on this earth, stop talking about how radiant, how beautiful, how kind, how cool, how hilarious, how witty, how vibrant she was. \u201cShe had a golden touch. Everything about her was magical, she was just so otherworldly. She looks just like an angel, and I just cannot believe that she has gone.\u201d In a statement, her family said: \u201c\u00d3rla was truly one of a kind. She was a beautiful, radiant, brave soul who always believed she would achieve her biggest dreams \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what she did. She danced her way across the world and lived life to the fullest every day. \u201cWe will never recover from the pain of having her taken from us so soon, in the prime of her life. But we are also so proud to call her our daughter and sister, and to have had the privilege of sharing 25 years with such an incredibly special person.\u201d Elmhurst ballet school in Birmingham, from where Baxendale graduated in 2018, described her as a \u201cradiant force\u201d on and off the dance floor. \u201cHer authenticity and ability to stay true to herself resonated with all who had the privilege of knowing her, and she had a remarkable gift for lighting up any room she entered,\u201d the school said. Baxendale trained and competed in Irish dancing from an early age before training at the Northern Ballet Academy and Elmhirst. She was cast in the world premiere production of Matthew Bourne\u2019s Romeo and Juliet and last June joined MOMIX Dance Company. The biscuit was bought from a branch of Stew Leonard\u2019s in Connecticut. Baxendale\u2019s lawyers in the US have said the death was preventable. In a statement, they said \u00d3rla\u2019s family had been \u201coverwhelmed and comforted by the outpouring of love, support, and tributes from around the world. \u201c\u00d3rla\u2019s vibrant spirit and her relentless pursuit of excellence in her art have left an indelible mark on all who knew her.\u201d They said Baxendale had been \u201ccareful and hyper-vigilant\u201d about everything she ate and always carried an Epi-Pen. The cookies were produced by the Long Island-based wholesaler Cookies United and labelled with the Stew Leonard\u2019s brand name, according to state officials. Stew Leonard Jr, the retailer\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a video post that the supplier had changed soy nuts to peanuts in the recipe without notifying their chief safety officer. Cookies United said it had notified Stew Leonard\u2019s last July that the product contained peanuts and that all products shipped to the retailer had been labelled accordingly. Cookies United said the incorrect label was created by Stew Leonard\u2019s. Stew Leonard\u2019s has recalled all the mislabelled biscuits in partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration.", "date": "2024-01-26", "section": "Society", "author": "Mark Brown North of England correspondent", "id": 591, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/768c458a33bf4b5b72d9ed64f7438f16eb395bbc/0_86_960_576/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Instead of not drinking, why not go for lower-alcohol wines instead? | Fiona Beckett on drink", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/jan/26/not-drinking-or-lower-alcohol-wines-fiona-beckett", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.042, "neu": 0.738, "pos": 0.22, "compound": 0.9967}, "body": "One of the reasons I\u2019m not in favour of dry January is that it teaches you nothing about moderation. The temptation is to go back to what you were previously drinking with a huge sigh of relief, in much the same way as you hit the Easter eggs after giving up chocolate for Lent. There is another way forward, though, and that is to buy wines that are lower in alcohol; after the recent increase in duty on wines with a higher ABV, there are a now growing number of them, too. An 11% wine, for example, attracts \u00a32.35 duty, compared with \u00a32.67 for most still wines; reduce that to 8%, meanwhile, and you have to pay only \u00a31.49. But is that likely to satisfy you? Apart from riesling (even that is higher in alcohol than it once was) and Portugal\u2019s vinho verde, few wines are naturally low in alcohol, and those that are generally tend to be sweet. Interestingly, one company that has cottoned on to the trend for lower-ABV wines is Laithwaites, which, according to wine director Nick Taylor, recently worked out that just under a tenth of all the bottles it sold in the past six months were 11% ABV or under. Not all its customers seem to be convinced, however: the Portuguese red in today\u2019s pick below seems to be a bit of a Marmite wine, with ratings ranging from one to four stars, with one customer proclaiming it \u201cdelightful\u201d and another \u201can appalling excuse for a red wine\u201d. I found it quite appealing when I opened it, but it was not as good the next day, plus I can\u2019t help but feel that if the duty is lower, the price should be, too. More widely popular is Laithwaites\u2019 bright, zesty Gooseberry Bush Colombard Sauvignon Blanc 2023 (\u00a39.99, or \u00a38.99 by the case, 10.5%), from South Africa, which is now the retailer\u2019s best-selling white. A better way forward might be drinking a wine you actually like, but doing so from a smaller glass and moderating the alcohol that way instead. A 125ml glass of a 12% wine (which comes about halfway up an average-sized wine glass) is 1.3 units, whereas a 14.5% one is just over 1.8 units; similarly, a 175ml glass, which is more common in pubs, would be 2.1 for a 12% wine and 2.53 for a 14.5% wine. (You can work out how many units there are in any drink by multiplying the total volume in millilitres by its percentage ABV and dividing the result by 1,000.) At the end of the day, it\u2019s up to you, but if you like the sound of lower-alcohol wines, here are four that should tick that particular box. Five wines that are lower in alcohol Maria Fadista Vinho Verde \u00a310.99 (\u00a39.99 as part of a mixed case of 12) Laithwaites, 8.5%. Fresh, sharp, spritzy white \u2013 good for the ABV. Stones &amp; Bones Ligeiro 2021 \u00a310.99 (\u00a39.99 as part of a mixed case of 12) Laithwaites, 10.5%. Soft, ripe, jammy red that packs a bigger punch than its abv. Share it with friends, though, because it\u2019s not as good the next day. Wrong Turn Fern\u00e3o Pires 2023 \u00a38.99 Aldi (in store only), 11.5%. Light, aromatic, off-dry South African white that you\u2019ll enjoy if you\u2019re a riesling or gew\u00fcrztraminer fan. Low stocks, so snap it up if you spot it. The Doctors\u2019 Riesling 2022 \u00a311.99 (\u00a38.99 on mix-six) Majestic, 9%. The Doctors\u2019 range is really good \u2013 there\u2019s also a very decent sauvignon \u2013 and this is a vivid, limey, off-dry riesling with a whiff of kerosene. Would be good with a Thai meal. Eric Texier Chat Fou 2021 \u00a312.25 (sale price, down from \u00a317) Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 12.5%. Fresh, gluggable vin de soif from the Rh\u00f4ne \u2013 a style that\u2019s clearly not entirely to Berry Bros\u2019 customers\u2019 taste, given the size of the reduction.

It was another devastating loss: I mourned those random, ordinary messages about nothing \u2013 about running late for coffee, how to cook burghul \u2013 because I couldn\u2019t bear never to hear her voice again. Sometimes, when I miss her now, I listen to our conversation about her work recorded for a writers festival, or I find one of her many radio interviews still available online. I love to hear her speaking voice: clear, unsentimental, truthful, funny. Self-deprecating, yet completely unashamed. Those same qualities are found in her writer\u2019s voice \u2013 in her memoirs and essays and in her fiction, most especially her last, finest novel. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In 2016 Georgia\u2019s friend, the writer James Bradley, wrote that her memoir Births Deaths Marriages \u201cunlocked something in Georgia\u2019s work, liberating her somehow, for after it her writing shifted registers, becoming simultaneously more personal and more expansive\u201d. I agree with James. I think her work grew in stature and clarity, and in the expansive confidence he notes \u2013 the confidence to hide nothing of herself, even in the works most full of invention. Her last works shine with authority and truth and courage. My grief for Georgia was also about the terrible unfairness of losing her work, just when her talent was approaching its height. How precious then, to have these \u201cnew\u201d stories, written between 2012 and 2015. Georgia had read them again around the time she was finalising Between a Wolf and a Dog, intending to offer them as a collection at an appropriate interval after the novel\u2019s publication. Then life changed suddenly and other things, other work took priority, particularly the writings that became the magnificent, posthumously published The Museum of Words: a memoir of language, writing and mortality. But the stories remained and now here they are. These stories once again enter the terrain of Georgia\u2019s familiar preoccupations. She had, by the time she died, let go of any youthful shame about being drawn back and back to the same ground. In an interview in 2016 she told me: I [used to be] embarrassed about it \u2013 there was that male sort of notion that you had to write completely outside yourself and you should be demonstrating a breadth of skill. But I\u2019m not that kind of writer. And I\u2019m not embarrassed any more, because many writers I love \u2013 like Alice Munro and Richard Ford, for example \u2013 write into the same material over and over. And what you write in your 20s is very different from how you interpret things when you\u2019re 50. You have quite a different angle on the same concerns. It was Flaubert who said fiction is \u201cthe response to a deep and always hidden wound\u201d. But there was nothing hidden about the great wound in Georgia\u2019s family \u2013 the loss of her brother to schizophrenia and drug addiction at a young age \u2013 and over time she came to accept this loss as a natural wellspring for her fiction. This collection is no exception. But in these stories we also see exploration of another lifelong preoccupation \u2013 Georgia\u2019s deep and complicated attachment to her mother and the new agony of watching her be consumed by Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But of course, writing fiction \u201cclose to home\u201d is not the same as writing memoir. Like all good art, Georgia\u2019s fiction takes the intimate experience of her own life and transforms it, and in doing so reveals new and surprising discoveries for all of us. We All Lived in Bondi Then has an elegiac quality, often meditating on the isolating aftermath of loss: the parents in the devastating Ship to Shore, unable to reach each other after the death of their child. The film-maker sister in Australia Square, trying to reclaim her own sidelined experience of a terrible childhood incident while her brother still suffers the consequences. Or the regretful Annie in Last Days, contemplating her lost self in motherhood. The stories are complex, sometimes morphing from one \u201csubject\u201d into quite another, like Dear Professor Brewster. A daughter\u2019s account of her mother\u2019s slowly blossoming Alzheimer\u2019s disease is also an account of her father\u2019s absence \u2013 she being the child of an affair, her mother the eternal other woman \u2013 and of the almost-siblings she could have had, the mixed-up family with their mixed-up resentments and loyalties. It\u2019s a beautifully bevelled story; each time you turn it, it shows itself in a different light. Youthful ambition\u2019s evaporation is another thread through these stories, often told from middle age, recalling the brutal clumsiness of youth. Twenty-something actors, writers, film-makers, musicians and dancers parade gorgeously through share-house parties in their op-shop finery, glittering with potential, drug-heightened recklessness, lust and destined fame. As one narrator says: \u201cMy hopes and desires and plans all unsullied, the self that I was to become beckoning, waiting.\u201d These artists in waiting reappear decades later in accidental meetings, now ruefully teaching drama in high school or managing music-licensing databases, chastened by the years and reality\u2019s bruises. It\u2019s testament to Georgia\u2019s clear-eyed vision that these transformations contain no lessons, no authorial judgments \u2013 simply her compassionate observation of the ways life has of turning out differently than we\u2019d hoped. Then, there are the dogs. Old dogs, disobedient dogs, abandoned dogs, mysterious telephone-answering dogs, dogs named Dotty and Pixie and Edna plod and skitter their way through these pages. Dying dogs, who carry meaning and knowledge we humans overlook or ignore, but who lead us to things we need to see. \u201cYou can\u2019t close their eyes when they die,\u201d says a child in Last One Standing and the narrator finds that it\u2019s true. Things are still to be seen, difficult things, following a death. In Australia Square, the narrator discovers her late mother\u2019s obsessive notes and diaries, documenting attempts to make sense of the event that changed the family for ever. The middle-aged narrator learns that she and her mother shared the same recurring dream of the calamity in one of these diaries. I\u2019d held it with trepidation, hoping I would find a clear, concise explanation for her relentless attempts to retrieve my brother\u2019s memory, perhaps some awareness of her own madness, maybe it was an apology I wanted, or a glimpse of softness and love, even regret that she had lost me. They were all there. And then I put the book away. It was just one slim volume amidst piles of notes and tapes, a few words that revealed another hidden, but not definitive, self. I had found something secret, but that did not mean I had found her. This ending shows us what Georgia always knew, what her writing has always told us: there are no easy answers. No clear conclusions will emerge to save us. Life will do with us what it will and our only task is to love one another as best we can. Like the bereaved couple lying mute in the dark, Georgia\u2019s clear, insightful voice tells us this is our only duty: to keep sending those whispered signals out and back, ship to shore, shore to lost ship. \u2022 This is an edited version of the foreword to We All Lived in Bondi Then by Georgia Blain (Scribe, $29.99)", "date": "2024-01-26", "section": "Books", "author": "Charlotte Wood", "id": 593, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8d530d49b8759266ee8f3d21bb5389aa0adf8b9c/234_223_741_444/500.jpg"}, {"title": " \u2018It was buy eggs or put money on my travel card\u2019: actor Lashana Lynch on Bond, Bob Marley and being broke", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/jan/27/actor-lashana-lynch-interview-007-bond-bob-marley-rita-marley-marvel", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.077, "neu": 0.709, "pos": 0.214, "compound": 0.9997}, "body": "Lashana Lynch is cocooned in a full-length padded coat and beanie, looking inconspicuous as a friend checks her into the well-known London members\u2019 club we have arranged to meet in, then leaves. Lynch sees me and grins, yet I can\u2019t help but picture the 36-year-old actor axe-kicking me in the face. That was more her speed with a history-making turn as M16 agent Nomi, the spy who takes over the 007 code number in Daniel Craig\u2019s 2021 swansong Bond film No Time to Die. Today, though, she\u2019s unassuming. So much so that no one besides the reception manager has recognised her. No big deal \u2013 except now there are no club members in our party and so we\u2019re flouting house rules. Lynch goes back and forth with a server after trying to order some peppermint tea without a membership card (\u201cUm, do you have a name?\u201d we\u2019re asked). Her friend calls to share the details we need. But you can\u2019t use a phone here, so she can\u2019t answer. Finally, after a manager is consulted and we agree to \u201csettle the tab straight away\u201d, the tea is on its way. That was awkward. \u201cThis feels like \u2026 Are we back in the 1960s?\u201d Lynch says, the subtext being that we are two young Black women feeling a little like intruders. \u201cIt just feels slightly oppressive. It\u2019s fine, though. I just won\u2019t do this again.\u201d Maybe Lynch just looks too regular outside the context (and costume) of her star-making action roles. She took on single-mother fighter pilot Maria Rambeau in Captain Marvel, her 2019 breakout. There was Bond, of course, culminating in Lynch\u2019s Bafta rising star win in early 2022. Then, months later, as barefoot warrior Izogie in Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s historical epic The Woman King, she swung her machete through pummelling fight-scene choreography with grit and fluidity (in an ensemble cast led by Viola Davis). She capped the year off as Miss Honey in Matilda the Musical, showing off her sweet singing voice, and briefly returned to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2023 for a shocking post-credits cameo in The Marvels. Next up, Lynch will play reggae matriarch and singer Rita Marley, Bob Marley\u2019s wife, in the forthcoming biopic Bob Marley: One Love. Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green with Kingsley Ben-Adir in the title role, the film focuses on a few years in the 1970s to tell the lesser-known stories of the man who became a legend in the decades after his death, aged 36, in 1981. It was shot in Jamaica, from which country Lynch\u2019s family originate. Lynch grew up in the London areas of Hammersmith and Shepherd\u2019s Bush, and has said that her class identity inspired her work ethic. She realised there were differences between her and some of her friends at primary school: they had au pairs (\u201cI didn\u2019t know what an au pair was!\u201d) and their families went on the sort of regular weekend excursions she thought were reserved for proper holidays. \u201cBack then, it was the size of friends\u2019 houses and the very casual way I might be told, \u2018Oh, you like that thing? Take it. You want a teddy? I can buy that for you.\u2019\u201d Lynch is magnetic to talk to: wide-eyed and husky-voiced. As an adult, her tendency to strive sometimes made her push herself too far. \u201cYou want to just keep going. I especially do, being from a working-class background. You want to just\u201d \u2013 she clicks her fingers \u2013 \u201cgo-go-go. You don\u2019t wanna miss out on anything, you don\u2019t wanna let anyone down.\u201d She is a grafter. Early on in her career, while appearing in Fast Girls, a 2012 film about rival track athletes, and a 2015 stage production of Educating Rita, she worked day jobs to pay her rent. While temping as an NHS receptionist, she was cast as Rosaline Capulet in Still Star-Crossed, executive-producer Shonda Rhimes\u2019s 2016 period drama about what happened next to the families of Romeo and Juliet. Without the safety net of a wealthy background, Lynch had to be strategic. \u201cI got the pilot. Shot the pilot. Came back home, still couldn\u2019t afford my rent or to pay off my credit card, was in the minus in my overdraft,\u201d she says. In the months-long gap between the pilot and shooting the rest of the series, \u201cI took my per diems from the show,\u201d as in the living-expenses allowance paid to cast and crew on location. \u201cI was shooting so much that I hadn\u2019t been able to spend them, and I brought them back to London, exchanged them into pounds, then bought groceries and things. Yeah, it was bad.\u201d She laughs drily. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta decide: am I buying eggs, or putting money on my Oyster card? And I had to make that decision many a time.\u201d This month, actor Peter Capaldi spoke out about the lack of opportunities for working-class actors these days, saying \u201cthere\u2019s less and less of my lot in the arts\u201d, and blaming \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who have left the industry full of \u201ctedious\u201d actors who \u201care not the real thing\u201d. The share of working-class actors, musicians and writers has halved since 1970, according to social mobility research from 2022. Meanwhile, a 2021 study found that actors from middle-class backgrounds were often found to self-identify as working class in order to build up a kind of mythology about their origins. But, for Lynch, growing up in a loving home that wasn\u2019t wealthy is no fiction. \u201cClass is always important to discuss, as the rise in an artist\u2019s career can make it appear as though they came from said level and just moved across \u2013 when that\u2019s absolutely not my experience. My working-class background has always kept me prepped with tools that have protected me in the industry,\u201d she says, tools such as resilience, drive and an ability to push forward after being told no. Until things change, says Lynch, \u201cin true working-class fashion, [rejection can] drive so much hunger that I\u2019ve seen projects from people that have come out of the many nos they were told. That sometimes sends out a louder message to the decision-makers.\u201d Lynch is the youngest of three children, and the only daughter. \u201cI want to say I naturally grew up as a tomboy, but, of course, with the influence of two older brothers, nurture had to have played its part,\u201d she says. \u201cI was outspoken in different ways, not so much in others. Being the younger sister, I felt protected. But I didn\u2019t feel like my brothers needed to protect me.\u201d Her mother worked in housing and her dad in social care. Lynch spent a lot of time with her maternal grandmother, too, and credits the strong women around her for shaping her personality. She tosses out casual assessments of self-belief as we chat \u2013 \u201cI deal with my stuff instantly\u201d or \u201cI know I can always find a solution to a problem very quickly\u201d. And so her early years seem a good place to start to figure out how she got this grounded. Would she barrel into the first day of school, or hang back? \u201cOh, it was anxiety-y-y. For the first day of anything,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cI always feel like I\u2019m at the first day of school when I enter new environments. I\u2019m like, \u2018This is what it felt like when I was four, at nursery, and they weren\u2019t listening to me.\u2019\u201d Lynch had eczema, and special provisions needed to be made to avoid flare-ups. \u201cLike soy milk instead of cow\u2019s milk, when soy milk wasn\u2019t so great in the 90s.\u201d This meant she had to describe the skin condition to sceptical adults. \u201cI learned how to use my voice to protect myself early on, though I wasn\u2019t the outspoken, confident person I am today. Definitely not.\u201d Her own Miss Honey, a supportive former deputy headteacher whom she still calls Miss Amable, reminded Lynch of how that has changed. \u201cI met up with her off the back of Matilda and she said, \u2018You really wanted to sing, and you really wanted to be on stage but you were so shy! And we had to access that through different ways.\u2019\u201d Amable brought Lynch out of her shell. On the Matilda set, Lynch had to be Amable-like herself. As fearsome headteacher Miss Trunchbull, Emma Thompson stomped around so convincingly that Lynch felt she needed to protect the child actors. \u201cThere were hundreds of children just watching Emma walk around with prosthetics and these teeth and these massive boots, and she was so unbelievably mean as this character,\u201d Lynch told the Wrap in 2022. She tells me her co-star was actually \u201cso warm and motherly towards the children after we cut. Working with so many children in one space, it\u2019s important that they know when we\u2019re playing dress up, so to speak, and when we\u2019re ourselves.\u201d When I ask her whether the big-name actors she has co-starred with, from Daniel Craig to Viola Davis, have taught her anything, she says: \u201cThey have always given me the space to learn and just be in my own way. If there\u2019s anything I have learned from them, it\u2019s that no matter how experienced you are, you\u2019re always having a first-time experience. The first-day-of-school vibes are real for everybody.\u201d She says she was encouraged to hear that they suffered from nerves. \u201cMany of them aren\u2019t too shy to tell you their fears, or the fact that they don\u2019t know something.\u201d Lynch\u2019s family was happy for her to explore singing and acting when she was a child without necessarily lining up a plan-B career. She attended Sylvia Young theatre school at weekends and later the Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick. She noticed then that being of Jamaican descent shaped her sense of home in particular ways. \u201cA lovely, plush kitchen with a Dutch pot in it,\u201d she says chuckling, or a bowl filled with plantain on the counter at all times. And, of course, Bob Marley\u2019s music was present; his global success personally significant. Lynch\u2019s earliest memories of the Marleys are of her doing chores while listening to Bob Marley and the Wailers on full blast. \u201cWhich is why I like cleaning now. Literally,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cCleaning is not a chore to me. Because on the weekends, playing their music \u2013 along with many other reggae legends, of course \u2013 was a spiritual experience.\u201d How does it feel to have taken on Rita Marley, such a well-known public figure from Jamaica? Daunting? \u201cMad, mad, mad, mad. So mad. And I\u2019ll probably say that for ever.\u201d A pause. \u201cA lot of people ask you, \u2018Are there any roles you\u2019d love to play? What\u2019s your dream role? What\u2019s your dream genre?\u2019 And there are certain things I don\u2019t think about, that I don\u2019t consider.\u201d One of which was the Marley family. \u201cI never imagined, ever, ever, ever imagined, playing Rita. I just \u2026 as you can tell, I\u2019m still trying to put my finger on how I feel, beyond honoured and grateful.\u201d Rita and two of her children with Bob, Cedella and Ziggy, and Ziggy\u2019s wife, Orly, are among the film\u2019s producers. As soon as Lynch got the part, she says: \u201cMy first question was: where is Rita and when can I fly to her? I had to make that happen.\u201d Rita welcomed Lynch into her home, twice, joined at points by Cedella, and Rita\u2019s daughter Sharon (Bob was her adoptive father), who brokered the meeting. \u201cAnd when I came in, it was like \u2013 I don\u2019t know, this is very dramatic but \u2013 a version of heaven,\u201d she laughs, \u201cwhere there\u2019s a god-like, queen-like ethereal figure sitting way in the distance, with their back to you.\u201d Lynch put down her things, and went to freshen up before going to greet Rita, \u201cand Sharon said, \u2018Mum said she can already see that you have the energy. She\u2019s so glad that you\u2019re here.\u2019\u201d Lynch puts her hand to her throat, and recreates her stage-whispered, wide-eyed \u201cThank you\u201d in response. They ate home-cooked meals and talked for hours. \u201cWe laughed about young love and reminisced about memories that seemed to be incredibly vivid and visceral,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cThere are obviously a lot of interviews with her. There\u2019s her book, which I\u2019ve read, but there\u2019s nothing like feeling the connection with her.\u201d Lynch wasn\u2019t so much sitting down and taking notes on, say, the way Rita speaks or sits; she was looking for something a bit looser on which to build her interpretation. In the film, the Marley matriarch is the backbone of the story, Lynch tells me. \u201cAgainst all odds, she was able to withstand while remaining graceful. Not an easy thing to do.\u201d Later, when shooting, Lynch used their time together to dig into her character; Ziggy and Cedella were also on hand to give her and the cast on-set advice. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that they were by our sides to answer all our questions. Things like, \u2018What should her bangle look like?\u2019 and, \u2018Is the head-wrap OK?\u2019 All of those things. But also whenever I questioned myself, I just tapped into Rita\u2019s energy that I\u2019d been able to sit with for hours at a time. Sometimes I don\u2019t even know if I made the right decision, but I know that it felt like the right decision.\u201d A couple of weeks after wrapping One Love in early 2023, Lynch shaved her head. It felt like a positive way to shed the role, for which she had worn a wig. A head shave is one thing, but what else does she do to decompress after a tough gig? \u201cUsually I don\u2019t speak to anybody,\u201d she says, deadpan. \u201cUsually I just go quiet. Not \u2018phone off\u2019, but less phone time, and I give myself as much time as I think I need. When the stuff is out, and I can just sit in myself again.\u201d Mostly, she\u2019s just learning to give herself a break between jobs. \u201cIn my 20s, I didn\u2019t believe I needed much time \u2013 maybe a few days? And now I\u2019m like, \u2018I need six months,\u2019\u201d she says, pursing her lips. \u201cGive me six months, and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d It sounds as if she toggles between extremes: intense work, then powering down rather than blowing off steam. To get to this point, she had to figure out how to fight her own corner. Lynch remembers a ballet teacher who thought she had bad posture because of the curve of her back into her bum. \u201cI was so aware of my Blackness, or my melanated-ness, because of how different my body was. Which a lot of older Caucasian women wouldn\u2019t consider when just telling you to \u2018stand up straight\u2019. And I mean, look, I have very great posture,\u201d she smiles, adjusting in her chair. Her teacher wasn\u2019t impressed, and Lynch didn\u2019t challenge her. \u201cThat was one example of me not learning early on how to utilise me, instead of being used. I was used, in that moment, because this white teacher didn\u2019t understand, and took it out on me.\u201d Lynch quit ballet not long after, when she was about seven, moving to track and field and netball. Being an active child and teen primed Lynch for physically taxing roles. She did her own stunts in The Woman King. She flings her arms out while telling me about the move that most challenged her. \u201cI had to run in a line \u2013 like, what\u2019s the event? A long jumper or a high jumper, I guess \u2013 then jump on a man\u2019s back like a bear, roll on my back with him still intact, land on my feet and then land with a strong pose at the end.\u201d She pulls her arms into an angular X. \u201cAnd I laughed my freaking head off. How \u2026 do you think it\u2019s possible for me to jump, like a bear, on a man? And stay there!\u201d But she did \u2013 and it made the opening scene of the film. \u201cIt\u2019s actually mad. I\u2019m reliving it now as I\u2019m speaking to you,\u201d and she chuckles to herself. \u201cI mean, Gina [the director] is one of the most wonderful humans on this Earth, but I still won\u2019t really forgive her for asking me to do that.\u201d A proper cackle now. Undergoing ninja training for No Time to Die, doing live stunts in The Woman King \u2013 they all initially sounded impossible. Lynch says directors seem to see her and think, \u201cGo on \u2013 I bet you can do this.\u201d When she was asked to skid along a balcony floor on her shoulder while being shot at, in No Time to Die, \u201cmy life flashed before my eyes. So it\u2019s not a challenge in that I don\u2019t believe I can do it. It was more, \u2018How do you trust me to do it? It did not make any sense to me, it did not compute in any way. Until I did it. And I thought, \u2018Wow, that was actually a much easier barrier to break than I\u2019d anticipated.\u2019 Really easy.\u201d Looking back on the girl she was, Lynch realises she dragged herself towards this confidence rather than seeing her introversion as an asset. \u201cI\u2019d taken it as: fight through the shyness, fight through the anxiety, so I can get to the point where I\u2019m confident.\u201d She was told by the No Time to Die stunt team that she was the only person who didn\u2019t get injured during training and filming. Her tendency to fight through both physical strain and niggling self-doubt seems to have paid off. \u201cI utilise so much from my childhood now, because it\u2019s literally in my bones to move in an athletic way,\u201d she says, before returning to ballet. \u201cAlso, thank God for that teacher. She\u2019s there probably doing the same thing, and I\u2019m out here like, \u2018Cheers for that.\u2019\u201d She raises her cup, an imaginary clink made. She smiles, pausing for a beat. \u201cCos now I get to kick people in the face on screen.\u201d \u2022 Bob Marley: One Love is released in the UK on 14 February", "date": "2024-01-27", "section": "Culture", "author": "Tshepo Mokoena", "id": 594, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/687a59078b2a35d19e5dcf41467c21a5a36701ed/0_359_8281_4967/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Power couples: how Hollywood\u2019s big name Oscar contenders balance life and work", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/27/oscars-2024-couples-barbie-oppenheimer", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.072, "neu": 0.681, "pos": 0.247, "compound": 0.9985}, "body": "The Academy award nominations on Tuesday contained, among the plethora of announcements, intriguing evidence of the strength of familial connections underpinning major Oscar bids, with a number of the 10 films nominated for best picture containing both members of high profile relationships, working together on the same film. Barbie, the doll-inspired blockbuster that, to the chagrin of many including Ryan Gosling, appeared to be snubbed in the best actress and best director categories, even contains two of them. Star Margot Robbie and husband Tom Ackerley are co-founders of LuckyChap Entertainment, the company that produced the film, while director Greta Gerwig is up for best adapted screenplay alongside her husband Noah Baumbach. The 2024 Oscar crop appears to have been particularly favourable to these kind of partnerships: the director-producer team behind best picture nominee Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, are also married, while Anatomy of a Fall director Justine Triet is up for a best original screenplay Oscar along with Arthur Hariri, with whom she is in a long-term relationship and has two children. Elsewhere on the list is May December writer Samy Burch, who shares a \u201cstory by\u201d credit with husband Alex Mechanik, and Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess, who has co-directed and co-written best animated short film nominee Ninety Five Senses with wife Jerusha. All these are film industry veterans, working together (and not) on multiple projects over the years; it is no doubt a coincidence, albeit a noticeable one, that so many find themselves up for Oscars together. Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls on Film podcast, says she has a positive view of the phenomenon. \u201cI think these are examples of real life partners working very well together with a shared vision, or at least visions that complement each other. Baumbach and Ackerley strike me as feminist allies and Baumbach doubtless brought a helpful and witty male perspective to the Barbie script, which he and Gerwig wrote living together in lockdown \u2013 handy!\u201d It is a form of creative collaboration that is by no means new: back in 1919, Mary Pickford, then one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, co-founded the studio United Artists with her future husband Douglas Fairbanks (as well as Charlie Chaplin and Birth of a Nation director DW Griffith). Thomas and Nolan met while both were students at University College London, and have worked together since their first short film, the Nolan-directed Doodlebug. Robbie set LuckyChap up with Ackerley in 2014 along with friends Sophia Kerr and Josey McNamara, while Gerwig and Baumbach met while making Baumbach\u2019s 2010 film Greenberg. It is self-evident, though, that the highly pressured environment of film production can pose special difficulties for collaborators also in a relationship. Rebecca Harrell Tickell and Josh Tickell, who have made a string of award-winning environmental documentaries including The Big Fix, Kiss the Ground and its followup Common Ground, say that the all-consuming demands of film-making are hard to manage. Harrell Tickell says: \u201cOur marriage and family are so enmeshed with our films and mission we can sometimes take the successes and failures a little too personally.\u201d Tickell adds: \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a great source of strength. The pitfall is that there is no division between work, family life and love life.\u201d While the risks of making films together are clear, it\u2019s evident that, in this Oscar round at least, we can see the positives. Nolan and Thomas have been making films together since their first short film, while Robbie and Ackerley have capitalised on the former\u2019s acting career to branch out and back the careers of directors such as Emerald Fennell and Megan Park. Despite their distinct authorial voices as high-profile directors, Gerwig and Baumbach collaborated on a script for Barbie that, beforehand, it would have seemed unlikely that either would have produced solo. The problem of how to resolve creative disagreements \u2013 without it destroying personal relationships \u2013 is a definite issue. Harrell Tickell says: \u201cMostly we are aligned, or one of us can be flexible. But if we strongly disagree we usually have to take a moment and hash out our opposing views away from our staff. When we resolve conflicts related to our films, we each get a vote and what the film needs gets a vote.\u201d Tickell suggests this can be a source of strength: \u201cMiscommunications are inevitable and there are of course moments when we don\u2019t see eye to eye. But often the \u2018third path\u2019, something neither of us saw, opens up and that new pathway is where the creative genius lies.\u201d In the end, though, the positives outweigh the negatives, says Harrell Tickell. \u201cEmbracing our partnership makes us exponentially more effective than either of us as an individual.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-27", "section": "Film", "author": "Andrew Pulver", "id": 595, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/826107a0218e287a641d7c934ff41ce6400c90be/5_133_5609_3365/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Climate scientist Mark Maslin: \u2018We have all the technology we need to move to a cleaner, renewable world\u2019", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/28/climate-scientist-mark-maslin-we-have-all-the-technology-we-need-to-move-to-a-cleaner-renewable-world", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.046, "neu": 0.736, "pos": 0.218, "compound": 0.9991}, "body": "Prof Mark Maslin studies climate change and human impacts as professor of Earth system science at University College London (UCL) and the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. He recently partnered with the comedian Jo Brand in an online film to \u201ctranslate\u201d climate science for a wider audience. He is one of the lead organisers of Love Your Planet with Al Gore\u2019s charity, the Climate Reality Project, and the Climate Cafe at UCL on 14 February. We\u2019ve just heard officially that 2023 was the world\u2019s hottest year, and that we are likely to breach the temperature rise limit of 1.5C warming above pre-industrial levels in the next 12 months. What are your thoughts on that? Last year being the hottest on record was something we knew was going to happen at the end of 2023. Two hundred of the 365 days last year were the hottest ever recorded for that particular day, which gives some idea of how huge this was. The temperature is 1.48C above the pre-industrial \u2013 close to the 1.5C limit [for this century] that was set up by the Paris agreement in 2016 \u2013 so we are worryingly close to it. We also know that El Ni\u00f1o [a natural weather pattern] is starting in the Pacific Ocean and always adds some warming. So in 2024, we could break the 1.5C limit temporarily. Last year we saw many extreme weather events: heatwaves, wildfires and floods \u2013 can we expect more of the same in 2024? In 2023, there were over 220 extreme climate events. There was a 30% increase in fatalities caused by climate events on the previous year. We saw massive heatwaves in North America, southern Europe, China and Asia. We also saw wildfires. And lots of underreported events. For example, east Africa had huge long droughts and catastrophic flooding. There was no continent that was not affected by extreme weather events \u2013 and our ability to cope with them is getting less. A lot of people have said to me: \u201cOh it was a rubbish summer in the UK.\u201d We had the hottest July on record. We had a slightly warmer than average August, and it was the second hottest year ever recorded in the UK. But because people are now expecting southern England to be like the French Riviera, if we don\u2019t have 30C weather in August they go: \u201cOoh it\u2019s not a good summer.\u201d No. We shouldn\u2019t be having summers like that. Ever. Two years ago we had a 40C heatwave in London, which had us climatologists with our jaws on the ground. We were predicting [40C] for the 2040s\u2026 The expectation of many climatologists, including myself, is that 2024 could be hotter than 2023, and with more extreme weather events as El Ni\u00f1o really takes hold. You\u2019re a professor of Earth system science at UCL \u2013 tell me about your main research? I study climate change in the past, present and future. My research is incredibly wide ranging: I study early human evolution in east Africa, the evolution of the Anthropocene and how human impact has changed through history, and the impacts of climate change on society now and in the future. I also look at resource crises in the future. You and your colleagues released a study on private jet flights and the carbon footprint estimates of travel to the Cop climate meetings just before Cop28 in Dubai last month. What were your findings? We looked at all private jet flights to Cop26 and 27. We are working on Cop28 now and will be releasing that at the end of this year. What we\u2019re not trying to say is world leaders have to go on commercial jets \u2013 because we want them to turn up to Cop meetings \u2013 but what we are saying is maybe all 100,000 people at Cop28 didn\u2019t need to be there. Please don\u2019t get me wrong: Cops are really important. This is a place where 198 countries come together as equals. So when you have a statement that says we are going to transition away from fossil fuels \u2013 which is signed by everybody \u2013 it has real weight. You recently featured in a short online film for Climate Science Breakthrough with comedian Jo Brand \u2013 who translated your words to get the message across. For example, her interpretation of governments giving subsidies to fossil fuel companies was: \u201cEven the dinosaurs didn\u2019t subsidise their own extinctions; who\u2019s the stupid species now?\u201d Jo Brand is an amazing person. We have very similar views and backgrounds. She worked for the NHS; most of my family work in the NHS\u2026 We have similar political views. When my mother was alive she loved telling the story of when she was pregnant with me and she had to drag the coal home because they couldn\u2019t afford to have it delivered. That tells you, one: that we were poor. And two: we had a coal fire, not central heating. So growing up in that sort of austerity means that Jo and I have a connection. There\u2019s one point in the film where we\u2019d been chatting about how we could make Britain better and Jo turned and said: \u201cOh Mark, I really think you should be prime minister.\u201d And I said: \u201cJo, do I really want that job?\u201d And she went: \u201cYeah, maybe not.\u201d I said: \u201cHow about we do it together?\u201d And she said: \u201cOh that\u2019s a good idea!\u201d And it was that comedy gold, that lovely rapport, which I think comes over. Might you be looking at a career in comedy? No, I\u2019m very happy to be the straight man! This communication of climate change, human impact on the world etc is incredibly depressing and can make people feel powerless. So there is always a little bit of humour running through everything I do. Also I try to talk about positives. Because in climate change there are so many solutions: things that we should be doing anyway. So renewable energy, guess what? We get much cleaner air, which means that we have less loss of life due to things like asthma and chest infections. Yes, tick, tick, tick. We have energy security because it\u2019s our own energy so we don\u2019t have all these incredible price rises. Fossil fuels are 19th- and 20th-century technologies. We have incredible technology now. Therefore, why don\u2019t we move into the 21st century and make things better? Is there room for climate optimism then? We have all the technology we need to move to a cleaner, renewable world. All the stats are showing incredible growth: we have exponential growth in solar, wind, EV batteries, which is all fantastic. We also have politics \u2013 90% of the world\u2019s economy says it will be net zero some time this century. That\u2019s huge. We are transitioning away from fossil fuels. It should have been 30 years ago, but it\u2019s now. The signalling is great, but we have to do it faster. You\u2019re organising a \u201cLove Your Planet\u201d event at UCL next month. What does it involve? The Climate Reality Project has got together with UCL to produce a day of panels, talks and networking on the green transition. How do we get business, politicians, academics and activists all working together to make this happen quicker? We also have hopefully a few positive words from Al Gore himself, in a short video introduction. It\u2019s on Valentine\u2019s Day. If you have a loved one and you\u2019ve forgotten, I will be reminding you that you should at least text \u2013 even without Jo Brand, I\u2019m using humour to try to engage people, and to think about their relationship with their loved ones, but also with their planet, which is their home. And it\u2019s the only one we have. Just like we nurture our relationships with other people, we really should be nurturing our relationship with our own planet.

Is anyone but us counting? In the past, I have always wondered about that moment when medical workers, especially doctors, lose that part of themselves where they start dealing with sick people as work and not as humans. Right now, I ask myself whether people around the world witnessing and watching our misery have reached the stage where they think of us as merely news instead of children with dreams for the future; mothers and fathers who wanted a better life for their kids; teachers who wanted to inspire the coming generations; and workers and farmers and musicians who wanted to follow their passion. For the first time since this whole nightmare started, I went to the sea. I forgot how vast and blue it is. It was like meeting an old friend. Everywhere around was packed; people are everywhere. I bet if you take a photo from a bird\u2019s view, all you are going to see is big numbers of heads in the shape of dots, with few spaces available. I sat on the sand and saw a big family by the shore. The women were filling buckets of water, and washing dishes and dirty clothes, while the men went shirtless into the sea with their trousers rolled up above the knees to wash. I saw a man and his son sleeping on a piece of cloth right under the burning sun. I felt sorry for them that they had nothing to cover their faces with. I remembered a discussion I had with Ahmad, the middle son of our host family, about his continuous back pain from sleeping on the ground. He told me that having a roof over his head when he sleeps is a thousand times better than sleeping in a tent or being displaced in schools. He said that we are really blessed. Ahmad keeps surprising me with his acts of kindness. A couple of days ago, he went out and gathered all the children and gave them balloons. He knows all the children, even the ones of the displaced families. And they, and their parents, know him. When he went up, his niece knocked on the door several times to tell him that children who did not get balloons have showed up. He gave her some to give to them. On the shore, there were many people walking. I saw a couple holding hands. I think they are really strong. The fact that they have the ability to express their affection to each other during these horrible times is impressive. There were also children playing with kites, but not normal ones. They were kites made of sewing thread and, instead of pieces of cloth, they had actual notebook papers with homework written on them. They say it is always about the perspective you have when you look or observe a certain situation. At that moment, I looked at the whole scene from the perspective of an exhausted guy crushed by the cruelty of life. I couldn\u2019t see the beauty of the children playing, nor the couple of lovers walking or the acts of survival of displaced people to maintain the bare minimum standards of hygiene, nutrition or shelter. I only saw the empty gazes of people towards the nowhere; I saw sadness all over the place. I saw people with eyes full of tears, I saw those who are desperate for a moment of peace during these chaotic times. I stayed for around two hours. Then I stood up and left. 12.30pm On my way to the house of the hosting family I passed by a pharmacy. I make sure to enter every pharmacy I find and ask for my medicine, and the different types of medicine that my friends or their families take. You never know when a pharmacy might get a couple of pills of any medicine from time to time. I ask the pharmacist about my medicine and expect that he would tell me that he does not have it, but I was wrong. He had one strip of it. I was very happy. I buy it, but on my way out, I go back and tell him that I still have some pills with me. I suggest that he cuts the strip in half and keeps the other half with him in case someone else asks for it. He smiles and says: \u201cThink only of yourself. In these times, it is all about survival.\u201d I don\u2019t agree with him. I insist that he takes half of it in case someone else asks for it. I pass by a huge line of people waiting for bread. I guess the number on the men\u2019s side was over 300 and on the women\u2019s, 200. A guy I know told me that if he could get bread for his family within five hours, he would be lucky. 2pm I arrived at the house of my host family to find four of my friends waiting for me. During the past couple of weeks we all ran into each other on different occasions, and since then, we have started to meet and sit together. None of us had a strong relationship before with each other (except for a married couple), but our relationship strengthened during these times. We chit-chatted for a while, until one guy said: \u201cLook at my shirt! Look at how wrinkled it is. One thing I wish to wear is an ironed shirt. I wish I could go back to the days when I used to take my clothes to the dry cleaner.\u201d I remember my own dry cleaner, and how trusted he was. Several times, he would give me money I forgot in the pockets of my shirts or pants. I wonder where he and his family are now and whether they are still alive. The words of the guy kept repeating in my head; I really wanted to do something nice for him. So, I got an idea. I went quickly and bought some coal. Coal is very expensive these days. It is the \u201cluxurious\u201d alternative, rather than wood, to generate heat. I bought a few pieces, and when I got back, I asked the grandmother if she could help me heat them. She generously agreed. After that, I asked her to give me the smallest frying pan she has. The frying pan was big enough for one egg. I put the coal on the frying pan and then went back. They all looked at me wondering where I went. I said to the guy \u201cTake off your shirt, I think we can make your dream of having an ironed shirt come true.\u201d I laid the shirt on the couch, and I started passing the heated frying pan over the shirt. After a long time and several trials, the shirt was \u201cironed\u201d. If you saw it in a normal context, you would never wear it, but compared to its old state, it was excellent. They were all laughing, encouraging me and, most importantly, asking me to be careful and not drop any coal on the shirt and ruin it. When I finished, he wore the shirt and was very happy. One of the women shared a situation about how scarce clothes are. She looked for days for a hoodie. Finally, she entered a shop and found one \u2013 only one. \u201cThe price was impossible. I refused to buy it. But then, only few minutes later, I decided to get it, since I am afraid I won\u2019t find anything else. I went back, and it was sold!\u201d After a while, one guy turned on a song by Umm Kulthoum on his mobile. Umm Kulthoum is an Egyptian singer who was given the title Star of the East. She had such a strong voice, she sang to big audiences without a microphone. The surprising thing is that, even in times where people look only for the quick songs and TV shows that you could binge watch during the weekend, many of the young generation still love listening to her hour-long songs without feeling bored. We were six people. When the song started, we started singing along and swaying to the music. For a moment, we forgot what is going on around us. We were just a group of friends, from all roads of life, enjoying some music. On their way out, my sister hugged the women and thanked all of them for the fun time we had. 8pm My stomach aches, my back hurts, my knees are killing me. I cannot stop thinking, and reminding myself, that right now I am living the best scenario anyone in Gaza is living. I am privileged to be under a roof, have access to some food and water, be around some nice people \u2013 and staying alive. Other people in Gaza dream of having half of what I do. Still, I am not OK, I am not OK at all. I am the complete opposite of OK. I am sad, broken, hurt, humiliated and displaced.

The dashboard, launched by the regulator Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), is thought to be a world first, and allows those looking to undergo processes such as IVF and ICSI, as well as researchers, to explore data from 1991 onwards, covering 665,690 patients. Among other features, users of the dashboard can filter the 34,725 new egg or 14,665 new sperm donors by year, by ethnicity, and by country of origin; explore the number of patients freezing or thawing their eggs each year \u2013 and the average age of doing so; look at trends for multiple birthrate per year; and explore how IVF success rates differ by age. The dashboard also highlights key statistics revealing, for example, that the percentage of cycles receiving NHS funding has changed from 38% in 2009 to 26% in 2021, while the birthrate per embryo transferred has risen from 7% in 1991 to 23% in 2021. Peter Thompson, the chief executive of the HFEA, said there were more than 70,000 fertility treatments a year in the UK. He said: \u201cAs the fertility sector has progressed over the past 30 years, so too has the opportunity to improve how we present and share data. Our new data dashboards mark the next step in even greater information transparency. \u201cFor researchers, finding out vital data about fertility treatment in the UK previously meant submitting inquiries one by one. The launch of the dashboard will ensure our wealth of data can be used to gain further insight, which could, in turn, improve outcomes for all.\u201d Prof Adam Balen, consultant in reproductive medicine at Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust, welcomed the availability of the data and the transparent approach of the HFEA, noting the HFEA\u2019s data is the greatest repository of information about IVF in the world. He said: \u201cThe new dashboard enables researchers to access data for study and patients to access information to better inform them on their fertility journey and thereby demystify some of the complexities behind the statistics of treatment outcomes.\u201d Stuart Lavery, consultant in reproductive medicine at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: \u201cThis new dashboard from the UK regulator should be welcomed by patients and clinics. Its graphical and table format presents very complex information in a straightforward and simple to understand manner. \u201cIt is a good demonstration of how we can use information from the world\u2019s most comprehensive IVF database for the benefit of patients seeking fertility treatment today. \u201cAlthough I would recommend my patients to use this, I would also advise that the best way to understand your own personal situation and chances of success would be through an individualised consultation with your fertility doctor.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-30", "section": "Society", "author": "Nicola Davis", "id": 600, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/38af3c2e1c638f1606b83d3f220ca2dee7cf4aaf/0_232_5701_3423/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Apple Vision Pro reviews roundup: stunning potential with big trade-offs", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/30/apple-vision-pro-reviews-roundup-stunning-potential-with-big-trade-offs", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.046, "neu": 0.737, "pos": 0.216, "compound": 0.9989}, "body": "The first reviews of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, from publications with early access to the company\u2019s attempt to create the next computing platform, talk of a big leap forward for face-mounted computers, for better or worse. The US-only headset, first announced in June last year, aims to move \u201cspatial computing\u201d beyond the limited mixed-reality offered by rivals from Meta, Microsoft and others. It is packed with cutting-edge technology including 3D cameras on the front to capture videos, the ability to blend the real and virtual worlds with hand and eye tracking, plus a display on the front that shows a simulacrum of the wearer\u2019s eyes. But at a cost of $3,499 (about \u00a32,760) in the US it has a lot of work to do to convince consumers and developers alike that it can be anything other than a super-expensive niche toy for tech enthusiasts. The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel called the Vision Pro an \u201castounding product\u201d but one with a lot of big trade-offs, including messing up your hair each time you put it on: \u201cApple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason \u2013 they represent a huge leap forward in display technology,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey also look generally incredible \u2013 sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for colour at the factory so they are also vibrant and colour-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge.\u201d But he said that while the passthrough view of the real world is the very best yet, \u201cthe field of view isn\u2019t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won\u2019t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro\u2019s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3\u2019s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you\u2019re seeing, a bit like you\u2019re looking through binoculars.\u201d CNBC\u2019s Todd Haselton was impressed by the hardware and experience: \u201cI loved watching movies with the headset. I lounged on my couch and put up a huge screen across the wall of my living room and watched an hour of Barbie and the two first episodes of Masters of the Air before the battery was at about 5%. Another night I watched Greyhound. I used the NBA app, which was updated to work on the Vision Pro, to stream four games at once, with the main game in the middle and others pinned to the sides. It\u2019s wild,\u201d he wrote. But he encountered the dreaded app gap problem that plagues new devices. \u201cThe Vision Pro supports more than a million iPhone and iPad apps. But you need to search for each app individually and some of them aren\u2019t available. Netflix and Spotify haven\u2019t been shy about not supporting the Vision Pro, though you can easily access either using the browser. Still, there are lots of others that I couldn\u2019t find: 1Password isn\u2019t there, which made logging into some apps a bit of a pain. You won\u2019t find Uber, DoorDash (but there\u2019s GrubHub!) or Amazon. None of Google\u2019s apps are here, including YouTube TV, though it works fine in the browser. \u201cPopular games like Diablo Immortal and Genshin Impact aren\u2019t available. Facebook\u2019s apps aren\u2019t here, so no Instagram. These are just a few I noticed.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern found the Vision Pro was actually good for getting work done, with virtual windows dotted across your view or replicating a Mac\u2019s display, as long as you have other bits of hardware: \u201cThere is a built-in virtual keyboard so you can type in thin air. But it will drive you mad for anything longer than a short message. And selecting smaller buttons with a pinch should be a carnival game. I started getting real work done once I paired the Vision Pro with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. \u201cI levelled up again by connecting my MacBook Pro, which let me write this review on a giant virtual monitor hovering over my desk.\u201d But was it heavy? \u201cOh yes. The metal and glass build gives it a premium look and a weighty feel. One included band has a top strap to lessen the face crush; the other wraps around your head like a comfy tube sock. The Light Seal (not a breed of sea mammal) acts as a cushion and light blocker. Mine is now covered with makeup.\u201d Weight is one of the reasons the headset has an external battery pack tethered to it by a cable, but even then Patel found the magnesium, carbon fibre and aluminium headset a daunting prospect: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it\u2019s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it\u2019s an iPad for your face.\u201d Mark Spoonauer, of Tom\u2019s Guide, found the battery pack to be one of the most annoying things: \u201cThe aluminum battery on the Vision Pro always needs to be with you to use the headset, which is not great. So you\u2019ll need to put it in your pocket while standing or next to you while sitting. It\u2019s 12.4 ounces, which is heavier than an iPhone 15 Pro Max (7.8 ounces). And while the cord is long enough most of the time, if you\u2019re really immersed in a game or other experience and you move suddenly, you could accidentally tug the battery off a table or couch on to the floor.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m also not a fan of how the cord to the battery can sometimes get a bit tangled. A couple of times I had to disconnect the cable so it would straighten out.\u201d Cnet\u2019s Scott Stein said the Vision Pro was \u201ca stunning look at the future\u201d, including ones envisioned in sci-fi: \u201cApple is also expecting the Vision Pro to be a place to see all your own life moments, reliving them like a scene out of Minority Report. I tried watching recorded \u2018spatial videos\u2019, which are 3D videos that I previously shot on an iPhone 15 Pro. I also played back 3D videos and photos recorded directly with Vision Pro, which has its own cameras. \u201cThe photo and video quality in 3D isn\u2019t as good as Apple\u2019s stunning 180-degree immersive video format, not even close. But when expanded to a fuzzy-bordered viewing mode, it starts to feel like a replayed memory. I went back to the holidays, to the Museum of Natural History, to a hotpot dinner with a friend in San Francisco, to a snowball fight with my kid. I started to forget where I was and imagined I could just walk into the moment.\u201d Stein said the Vision Pro was the best wearable display he had ever put on, but still a tough sell in its current form. \u201cAt its price, and with so few VisionOS apps at launch, the Vision Pro isn\u2019t a device I\u2019d recommend to any of my friends or family. If you\u2019re in the immersive industry and can afford one then that\u2019s another story. But for anyone else, I\u2019d recommend you get a free demo at an Apple Store, marvel at its features and wait and see.\u201d", "date": "2024-01-30", "section": "Technology", "author": "Samuel Gibbs Consumer technology editor", "id": 601, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/900c6d92bf3dfef6e0ed4bde61f2dcfbdd312662/0_78_3389_2033/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Big swings, big misses and big deals: what happened at this year\u2019s Sundance?", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/30/sundance-film-festival-movies-recap", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.105, "neu": 0.664, "pos": 0.231, "compound": 0.9989}, "body": "The high bar raised by last year\u2019s Sundance film festival had caused many to feel a little underwhelmed by this year\u2019s edition, a commonly tweeted and spoken concern over just whether this year could truly boast a major breakout movie. Twelve months prior, the workplace thriller Fair Play, erotic drama Passages, nifty horror Talk to Me, romcom Rye Lane, timely documentary 20 Days in Mariupol, mother-son music tale Flora and Son and decade-spanning romance Past Lives caused waves that continued for the next year, an unusually robust lineup, fittingly given that it was Sundance\u2019s big in-person comeback. It was a slightly more muted affair over in Utah this year, some attributing a weaker lineup to 2023\u2019s dual strikes, which prevented many productions from going ahead, but there were still enough gems amid the murk and a promising raft of major multimillion deals. Because while the strikes may have allegedly affected the roster, they also had a definite impact on the thirst of buyers, in frantic need of films to help repair lighter-than-usual release schedules. There might not have been anything as buzzy as Past Lives but this year\u2019s crop of films continued to edge away from a reliance on A-listers to draw attention, a relief after a period of limp, star-led projects taking slots away from smaller, more deserving fare. One of the biggest audience hits of the festival was led by an A-lister but it was a chance to see a major star do something we really hadn\u2019t seen them do before: truly be themselves. Will Ferrell, a chameleonic comedian whose last Sundance offering \u2013 the misjudged remake Downfall \u2013 sank without trace, heads on a crowd-pleasing cross-country road trip in Will &amp; Harper, the twist being that he\u2019s playing himself. In the glossy yet at times deeply emotive documentary, Ferrell goes on the road with Harper, an old friend who has recently transitioned and the two grapple with a new update of an old dynamic as well as a country that actively tries to suppress trans rights. There\u2019s discomfort, tears, laughter as well as a depressingly necessary education to be had, the film perfectly pitched to allow others into an experience they may know very little about. It\u2019s yet to be purchased yet but rumours suggest that a number of major buyers are fighting it out (with Netflix reportedly out in front), the sort of documentary that could become a box office hit and an awards contender. Stay tuned. Another documentary that had people talking, as well as cheering and crying, was Super/Man, a revealing and at times devastating look at the life and death of Christopher Reeve. Packed with A-list friends and intimate, unseen footage, it\u2019s a blockbuster doc that was quickly, wisely snapped by Warner Bros, the studio reportedly planning a release that would involve repromoting old Superman films. With other docs hitting such as Union (focused on Amazon\u2019s growing labor union), Girls State (a sequel to hit Boys State), Skywalkers (a daredevil romance picked up by Netflix) and the audience prize-winning Daughters (centered on a program that brings girls together with their incarcerated fathers), it felt like a strong year for the US, coming just after a rather weak one, with all five Oscar documentary noms coming from international film-makers. The biggest sale of the festival to date was the gimmicky thriller It\u2019s What\u2019s Inside, picked up by Netflix for $17m after bidding out other rival studios. The film, about a pre-wedding party that turns into chaos when an unusual game is played, was made with a low budget and no known stars and will probably be the start of a new franchise for the streamer if all goes to plan. Sundance is known for premiering major new genre titles (past years have seen Get Out, Hereditary and The Babadook all take their bow) and while critical opinion was more divided on that one, there was almost universal agreement on another title also featured in the midnight strand. Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun made an impression at 2021\u2019s virtual Sundance with haunting digi-horror We\u2019re All Going to the World\u2019s Fair and their follow-up I Saw the TV Glow has now cemented their name as one of the most exciting, and daring, new voices we have right now. A sad, troubling story about identity, representation and obsession told through the connection two teenagers have to a Buffy-esque TV show, it\u2019s being positioned as A24\u2019s next genre crossover hit but might face an uphill struggle with more mainstream audiences, pushing more boundaries than the company\u2019s previous attempts Midsommar, Talk to Me or even The Witch. An unusual genre film that might also pose a challenge for audiences is Steven Soderbergh\u2019s experimental ghost story Presence, bought at the festival by Neon. It\u2019s a loosely familiar tale \u2013 family moves into new house, new house is haunted \u2013 but told from a unique perspective. While it comes from the writer of the director\u2019s last genre exercise \u2013 HBO\u2019s excellent thriller Kimi \u2013 it may go the way of Unsane, the 2018 iPhone-shot shocker that struggled to find an audience after a bizarrely bullish wide release. Presence, for all of its technical prowess, might not deliver enough horror or drama to spark with the majority but with Neon forking out just $5m, modest returns might not be a big problem. One of the more surefire commercial hits of the fest came with a name that might not be quite as easy to sell: the coming-of-age comedy My Old Ass. A mostly star-free cast, save for a brief Aubrey Plaza appearance, it sells the kind of slick yet sensitive audience hit that used to make genuine money after premiering at Sundance and it\u2019s no surprise that Amazon-MGM bought it for a major $15m with a wide release planned. The recent sleeper success of Anyone But You, a far weaker film yet with a similarly glossy 00s studio feel, suggests that with the right marketing this could also scratch a similar commercial itch. Searchlight is hoping for another old-fashioned Sundance hit, paying $10m for buddy comedy A Real Pain, one of the more popular on-the-ground premieres of the festival. It\u2019s the second film from Jesse Eisenberg as writer and director, also starring here alongside Kieran Culkin as cousins paying respects to their late grandmother on a guided tour through Poland. After Culkin picked up a Globe and an Emmy for the last season of Succession, expect a supporting actor Oscar campaign for this one. It\u2019s yet to be purchased but artist Titus Kaphar\u2019s stirring family drama Exhibiting Forgiveness, about a painter reconnecting with his addict father, could also be well-positioned for awards with a knockout central performance from Moonlight\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Holland. Saoirse Ronan, who already has four Oscar nominations under her belt, might be on the way to her fifth with knotty recovery drama The Outrun, an every-scene showcase that impressed critics here. It\u2019s also yet to find a US distributor. Kristen Stewart did double-duty at the festival with two wildly different offerings which had wildly different responses. Her first was Love Me, an unusual high-concept romance set in the future between two machines powered by artificial intelligence. Also starring Steven Yeun, who broke out at the festival with Minari back in 2020, the film was dismissed by most as a big bet that didn\u2019t pay off and is yet to be sold. Her other film, gory midnight thriller Love Lies Bleeding, had a far more positive response and with A24 behind it, its mix of in-your-face 80s nostalgia and gory crime theatrics should lead to a decent spring hit when it comes out in cinemas. On the ground, film-makers expressed uncertainty over the future of independent film with many using interviews and Q&amp;As as reminders that the road to the festival is rocky and that even after premiering, nothing is certain. \u201cIndependent film in America becomes more about training people to become Marvel directors and less about creating a viable alternative where more radical visions can be seen and appreciated,\u201d said Schoenbrun, the director of I Saw the TV Glow. Sean Wang, director of the audience award winner D\u00ecdi, added that the industry \u201cis in a very uncertain place\u201d. The festival itself is facing an uncertain future with rumours suggesting that it might move from its Park City home. Locals have long complained about the pressure the festival puts on such a small town while visitors have stressed the difficulties that come with traveling so far out to attend. \u201cThere are challenges,\u201d the Sundance Institute CEO, Joanna Vicente, said. \u201cI mean, accessibility is a challenge.

If you\u2019re going to change your intake of food, you do need to do research. But I do think it\u2019s just as easy to be an unhealthy person who isn\u2019t a vegan as it is to be a healthy vegan. Grace Fielder, 44, Milton Keynes \u2018I found a kindred spirit through veganism\u2019 I started Veganuary in 2020, before the world descended into Covid chaos. I\u2019d been leaning that way already, eating less meat, when a friend said: \u201cGive it a go, you love animals\u201d \u2013 so I did. Little did I know this would change my life. I started following social media accounts for vegan recipes and came across a vegan guy in Scotland. I liked his food pictures and he grew vegetables like me. One night, he opened his DMs for those finding Covid hard. We were soon talking daily about vegan food, failed marriages, politics, our love for the Guardian cryptic crossword and of course life during the pandemic. We graduated to phone calls, video chats and watching Gardeners\u2019 World together over a livestream. We found a kindred spirit in the chaos. At the time he lived in Scotland and I lived in Ireland. But in Christmas 2020, you could travel with a negative Covid test \u2013 so I visited him and we were engaged at Edinburgh Castle. When I had to go home, the staff at the airport were very kind to the woman sobbing in departures. In January 2021, there was a similar let-up of Covid restrictions and my Scottish vegan man packed up his life and moved to Ireland. We married in September of that year with a vegan cake. Amber McKay, 52, Roscommon, Ireland \u2018My wife and kids withdrew from our vegan expedition\u2019 For me, [doing Veganuary] this year was all about making a small, positive change for the sake of the environment. I have learned that good vegan food needs to be thought out. The key is having the right ingredients in the cupboard: miso, good pastes, coconut milk, nuts, dried fruit, dried mushrooms. You should treat each ingredient individually to make the flavour. Dry roasting veg helps add depth to the food. To hit the creamy notes, the vegan cheese is just a no for me. However, the vegan coconut-based yoghurts are so nice for a chilli burrito or making a raita. It has been fun and enlightening and I had some shocking periods in the kitchen making vegan mozzarella for our weekly \u201cpizza Fridays\u201d. This was the point at which my wife and kids fully withdrew from our vegan expedition. I\u2019m not going to be fully vegan now. Not having chocolate and cakes is really good, and I don\u2019t miss it. I\u2019m going to be vegan in the working week and then do whatever I wish on the weekend. Matt Haley, 37, Bramhall \u2018I\u2019m not being strict\u2019 I\u2019ve done \u201chalf-arsed Veganuary\u201d, where I try to reduce my dairy and egg intake as much as I can, but I\u2019m not being strict. I\u2019ve been vegetarian for years so the meat part isn\u2019t hard. I\u2019m a massive chocoholic, though, so I\u2019ve missed milk chocolate, but I\u2019ve had dark chocolate instead. The hardest parts have been avoiding ultra-processed food, which so much vegan shop-bought food is, and when I\u2019ve had less choice \u2013 such as when visiting motorway services or attending a family funeral where the spread at the wake was all meat and cheese-based and my vegan option was ready salted crisps. I am not going to start checking through all my beauty products, for instance, to see if they\u2019re vegan. I already check to see if they\u2019re tested on animals. I will make changes to reduce dairy and egg content from now on, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go fully vegan. Claire, 32, Birmingham \u2018I am still vegan \u2026 What\u2019s not to like?\u2019 I registered for Veganuary in January 2018. Previously, I had been a vegetarian for a long time, but had started buying organic meat. I was under some misapprehension that this was friendly to other species. I remember slicing some organic chicken during 2017 and I had what felt like an epiphany. This was a living, breathing, sentient being and I decided I didn\u2019t want to be part of this anymore. However, I believed that being vegan was quite extreme, so I wasn\u2019t sure where to start. That\u2019s when my friend suggested Veganuary. The experience was fascinating and challenging. I had told my family that I wouldn\u2019t be buying or cooking anything that wasn\u2019t vegan, and they agreed to join me, which helped. I subscribed to a vegan magazine which helped with the meal planning and I bought the Veganuary book which has encouraging advice as well as reminding me why going vegan is important. I watched the recommended films and read widely. All of this made the month really easy. There have been some bumps along the way \u2013 eating dairy by mistake \u2013 but I am still vegan and love it! I\u2019m much more confident with cooking vegan dishes and feel healthy, physically and mentally. What\u2019s not to like?

By developing specialist knowledge of a subject and creating and disseminating new knowledge, they contribute to society\u2019s development, improve the reputation of a university and make an institution more desirable for students. Technology can be transformative for researchers, giving them the tools to eliminate time-consuming tasks, collaborate with others around the world, and ensure their work is shared \u2013 and challenged and understood \u2013 as widely as possible. Despite this, digital transformation has so far largely focused on teaching and the student experience and has at times overlooked how technology can help researchers to produce and disseminate world-class research more easily. A recent report by the professional services firm EY \u2013 based on a survey of more than 3,000 undergraduate and post-graduate students, group discussions with teaching faculty and professional staff as well as interviews with university leaders around the world \u2013 found that researchers face a number of academic and administrative burdens that can impede their work. The report found that researchers need the equipment, technologies and computing power to support their work and also want tools that will allow them to spend more time on conducting groundbreaking research in new areas. Avantika Tomar, a partner at the consulting firm EY-Parthenon, who focuses on higher education strategy, says researchers want to identify research gaps, foster collaborations and minimise administrative tasks. While universities have often invested in technical equipment and computing power to enable leading-edge research, they have sometimes neglected to focus on other ways in which technology can help researchers succeed. So how can tech free up researchers\u2019 valuable time to better focus on the work they love? Increasing researchers\u2019 bandwidth One of the most time-consuming tasks for researchers is sifting through information and identifying gaps in research that could be further explored. Tomar says: \u201cI did a PhD myself and I remember that everything I would come up with as a potential research topic, someone somewhere in the world had either already done or was currently working on. There\u2019s an overwhelming amount of data available, published in all its forms \u2013 some as articles, some as book chapters, some as books themselves, some as blogs.\u201d However, digital tools such as ResearchGate and academia.edu can ease these burdens. Using the right keywords and themes, researchers can sift through information more efficiently to identify what data they are looking for and find research gaps to explore. \u201cWhat it helps [researchers] do is to save time,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cTime that they can spend on the analytical or insightful part of the research, as opposed to the mundane data-related part. I think time-saving is the biggest thing. You can innovate more when you have the time, headspace and bandwidth.\u201d Spending time on research \u2013 not admin A key frustration for researchers is the amount of time spent on administrative work, EY\u2019s research found. There are a great many administrative tasks associated with conducting academic research, many of which are still paper-based, or require academics to access multiple systems and enter the same data numerous times. Universities can make a real difference to their research communities by improving these processes through technology \u2013 ideally with an end-to-end digital system for the entire research lifecycle and across institution. \u201cIn the future, we aim to realise an environment in which researchers can focus on their research and are not troubled by management tasks,\u201d says Prof Atsushi Kanai, professor at Hosei University in Tokyo. \u201cA good number of procedures require teams to input identical sets of information across multiple documents,\u201d says Prof Yasushi Asami, professor at the University of Tokyo. \u201cWe intend to extend our use of digital transformation to end that type of duplication.\u201d Technology can help to streamline mundane and time-consuming administrative tasks that distract from more meaningful parts of research. Administrative tasks such as grant applications, risk assessments, progress reporting, budget management, reviews and publication could all be made easier by using technology. Building relationships with research partners Technology can also help researchers to connect with each other to share data and ideas, another key priority for research academics, according to EY\u2019s report. Researchers need effective collaboration platforms, tools to share sensitive data securely, and opportunities for face-to-face networking, they said. \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cBuilding relationships with researchers globally takes time and effort; but if you don\u2019t, you will find it difficult to get your paper published or to have a network to attend the right conferences with.\u201d Digital communication tools such as social media, podcasts and video calls help foster collaboration, making it faster, more efficient and easier to connect with others around the world and to share data and ideas, improving the quality of research and widening the pool of potential collaborators, which is particularly helpful for those working in niche fields. Institutions that have embraced technology are already feeling the benefits. As one research academic in Singapore highlighted: \u201cI work so effectively with other researchers all over the world. Our research is being done in different labs in different parts of the world, my co-researchers are able to track results from far away, work with the data, speak to me, speak to my colleagues. It\u2019s a totally different world now, thanks to digital technology.\u201d However, it\u2019s important to not forget the value of face-to-face collaboration \u2013 the sort of water cooler moments that happen naturally in the offline world. To maximise research effectiveness, online and offline collaboration must be championed and nurtured. Universities also need to manage their collaborative tools and information systems carefully and implement robust cybersecurity measures and processes to protect sensitive research data, the report found. Helping research reach a wider audience The impact of even world-class research will be limited if no one has access to it. Digital tools enable researchers to share their work more widely and help people outside of academia to understand it. \u201cSometimes I feel academic research is only meant for academics,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cBut data visualisation tools can help make it more readable for lay audiences, allowing you to showcase your research to policymakers and the corporate world and increase its impact,\u201d Tomar says. Digital tools have the potential to transform the world of research for the better and increase the chances of finding real world application for scientific advancement. However, researchers need access to the right equipment, technologies, and computing power. Digital technologies and sophisticated online resources, such as libraries, large databases, statistical packages and modelling tools, will need to be accessible to all. \u201cA lot of these technologies are not accessible or affordable for every researcher,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cTo get to the point where we are meaningfully using technology, it needs to be more accessible to a wider audience as opposed to a select few.\u201d With the right commitment and tools in place, academics would be able to focus their energies purely on the subjects they\u2019re passionate about and produce world-leading research with fewer obstacles in the way. \u201cWe\u2019ve started moving in the right direction,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cThe tenacity of academic researchers and the implementation of the right technology is transforming research to achieve superior outcomes.\u201d To find out more about harnessing tech to transform research, EY\u2019s latest report into higher education", "date": "2024-01-31", "section": "Transforming higher education", "author": "Abby Young-Powell", "id": 605, "thumbnail": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cbb928265a800a63816e3c5828f1fb85c9be0f9c/0_0_6720_4032/500.jpg"}, {"title": "Saving time and becoming more effective: how new tech can free university staff", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/transforming-higher-education/2024/jan/31/saving-time-and-becoming-more-effective-how-new-tech-can-free-university-staff", "sentiment": {"neg": 0.027, "neu": 0.697, "pos": 0.276, "compound": 0.9995}, "body": "A digital revolution centred on human experiences could provide teaching and administrative staff working in higher education with more of a valuable resource: time. This is one of the key findings from recent research by the professional services firm EY, based on focus group discussions among 116 teaching faculty and 147 professional staff, as well as interviews with 28 leaders from universities across the world to discover what they want from digital transformation. What the report reveals can help university leaders develop more effective and efficient operations that are built for the people who use them, improving job effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. By automating key processes, implementing joined-up systems that allow for better data sharing and analytics, and utilising new intelligent technology, universities can enhance the experience for their teaching and administrative colleagues. Freeing up time for university staff Sean Jackson, a managing director at EY US specialising in higher education, says technology can help to minimise and eliminate the \u201cwaste\u201d in teachers\u2019 and administrators\u2019 workloads. He believes that \u201chigher education is a system co-created by students and faculty members. Anything that gets in the way of that is subject to legitimate scrutiny,\u201d he says. Digital tools can help reduce mundane and repetitive tasks, he argues, leaving more time and energy for teaching and other core elements. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at what people really value and how technology can be leveraged to maximise that,\u201d Jackson says. As one UK teaching faculty focus group participant asserted: \u201cWe are trying to give back time to pedagogy and teaching by making things quicker. It is now easier to design timetables and organise assessments.\u201d That\u2019s where a digital revolution comes in. Technology can help to eliminate waste, and free up time for staff in higher education to focus on tasks that will deliver more value. Crucially, technology must be built around their needs so they can deliver more efficiently and effectively for students and the university as a whole. Teaching faculty and administrators alike could utilise automated tools that can remove mundane or repetitive tasks such as answering routine student questions, collecting class feedback, and processing applications. Digital tools can also help to automate timetabling and scheduling, while marking tests could be reduced by using digital online assessment and grading tools. This is already a reality in some parts of the world. A faculty focus group participant from Singapore said: \u201cDigitalisation has improved the day-to-day services we need to do and save us time \u2013 even though initially we might take time to familiarise ourselves with the system.\u201d Overstretched administrative staff are still bogged down by low-value, manual tasks, such as processing applications or data entry \u2013 all of which can be automated. \u201cIt\u2019s about increasing the amount of time staff can spend making a difference to the students versus satisfying the system,\u201d says Paul LeBlanc, president of Southern New Hampshire University in the US. Looking ahead, embedded generative AI could soon further lift the administrative burden by creating progress reports, sending emails, and suggesting opportunities for automating other processes. The University of Virginia, also in the US, is one institution that has begun using technology to free up administrators\u2019 time. EY helped the university to develop and deploy an AI-driven virtual HR assistant, CavBot, to provide new staff with a warm and personalised welcome. CavBot answers employee queries and helps new hires to complete onboarding tasks, including filling in forms and applying for security badges or parking permits. Improving the student experience EY research also highlighted staff\u2019s hunger to generate insights that can improve learning experiences and student outcomes as well as support leadership decision-making. Digital processes generate a wealth of data that can be used to create dashboards, reports and trackers, but decentralised and siloed systems mean staff spend an inordinate amount of time looking for different data on different systems. Unifying disparate systems and creating greater cohesion between them enables greater exchange of data and helps intelligent tools to analyse data from different sources, flagging issues and even prompting actions based on insights. With the right systems in place, universities can harness data and analytics to gain more holistic insights into student and staff engagement and proactively offer interventions to improve their experience. For example, at the University of Canterbury, in New Zealand, data is collected on class attendance, assignment submissions and assessment completions. When problems with student engagement are detected, a text is sent automatically, meaning the issue is caught and corrected early and support provided if needed. Their colleagues from across the Australian and New Zealand higher education sector are excited by the opportunities data and automation present. In a focus group, they enthused that it could \u201cbe a huge help for teaching staff and students alike, providing better outcomes for students \u2013 and it\u2019s also positive for staff who can dedicate more time to teaching and research\u201d. Empowering staff There are many potential benefits of a digital transformation. But teaching and non-teaching staff alike need support in using new tools and adapting to digital workflows. In some parts of the world, there is a systematic focus on upskilling staff: in Ireland, the technological university sector is investing heavily in digital transformation, including upskilling staff, developing digital skills training materials, creating a sustainable HE curriculum framework, and implementing shared assessment systems. Helping staff of all kinds to feel empowered will be crucial to the success of any digital transformation, and there are already institutions developing strategies to do this. Some universities have digital champions in each department who act as early adopters and work cross-departmentally to solve common issues. Others have incorporated digital learning into their performance and promotions processes, creating career incentives for those who embrace technology, or build digital skills programmes into their faculty onboarding processes. All of this should be underpinned by ensuring systems and tools are easy to use, and providing accessible, empathetic training and incentives. Overall, better use of technology can save teachers and administrators time and energy, rid them of repetitive tasks, and help them to focus more on students. \u201cBy using technology to help focus the time and attention of faculty and student on what matters most, we see the outlines of a compelling and exciting future begin to emerge,\u201d says Jackson. And as EY\u2019s report outlines, this future could transform the lives of teaching and administrative staff.
