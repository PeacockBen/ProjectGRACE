        "body": "Norman Kay, who has died aged 77, was the first Green party chair of Stroud district council and was still in office as vice-chair. He served the council for 21 years, first as Labour and later a Green party representative, as well as being a Nailsworth town councillor for 14 years, including three as mayor. Norman was first elected as a Labour councillor in 1983, for the village of Leonard Stanley and then Nailsworth. He became deputy leader of the Labour group, chief whip and chair of the housing committee. Following the Iraq war, he resigned from the Labour party and was re-elected to Stroud district council as a Green councillor in 2016. Besides being chair and vice-chair, he served on a wide range of committees. A Stroud Green party spokesperson described him as \u201cirreplaceable\u201d. Born in Bethnal Green, east London, to Sylvia (nee Sidloff) and Sidney Kay, a radical Jewish family, Norman went to Hackney Downs grammar school. He became politically active as a teenager, serving as secretary of Hackney Independent Labour party. After a spell of taxi driving in London, he studied sociology and political science under Zygmunt Bauman at Leeds University and was elected to the student union executive committee. After graduation, he became a social worker in Doncaster in 1973, then Bristol in 1976, and, finally, Gloucestershire, from the early 1980s to 2006. With his wife, Kate (nee Berry), whom he met at university and married in 1971, and some friends he established a socialist/feminist bookshop in Bristol called Full Marks. Master\u2019s degrees in social administration under Peter Townsend (Bristol University, 80s) and public administration (Birmingham University, 90s), and a degree in chemistry (Open University, 2000s) followed. By the 90s, Norman was managing his own adult and mental health social work team. He was accredited as a specialist in mental health early in his time at Bristol. A kind, gentle and principled man, Norman was widely respected across his community. He could \u201cdisagree agreeably\u201d, and worked constructively with a wide range of groups, of different political views and none. A committed member of the council\u2019s equality, diversity and inclusion working group, he was its chair in 2021. He was actively involved in Stroud\u2019s Gay Pride and Holocaust Memorial days and supported anti-slavery initiatives, including the removal of the Blackboy clock in Stroud. He also supported calls for Palestinian rights. Norman collected for the poppy appeal every year and served on the Cotswolds area of outstanding natural beauty committee. He was active in promoting the Stroud show and liked to exhibit his own rare breed Cotswold sheep locally. Norman and Kate also had a goat, horses and pigs. He was still looking after his livestock up to last year. A keen racing supporter, he was a member of Cheltenham racecourse. I met Norman at a constituency Labour party meeting in Stroud, where Kate and I shared the role of constituency secretary. He and I were friends for 40 years. Norman is survived by Kate, and his sister, Frances.",

        "body": "Before Kim\u2019s Convenience became a hit Netflix series, it was a play on the Toronto fringe. Now, Ins Choi\u2019s comedy drama turned sitcom, about the travails of a Korean Canadian family running a convenience store, returns to theatrical form but feels like a melange of two media. The cast is not that of the TV show, and Choi himself plays outspoken father, Appa, but the production has the uncanny, slightly confusing, look and feel of a live TV studio recording. It is a smooth machine of a show nonetheless: its comedy works, its acting superb, its story warm but not too mawkish and its characters lovable even when they border on the prejudiced, like Appa. Masterfully directed by Esther Jun, this is popcorn theatre: we could go on watching and watching. The story crunches strands from across the five series into 80 minutes. Beneath the comedy are themes of immigration, parental sacrifice and the gulf between Appa and his children. There is his daughter, Janet (Jennifer Kim), whom he wants to divert from photography into running the shop, and his estranged son, Jung (Brian Law), who left home years ago. Janet feels like the focus here, her romance with police officer Alex (Miles Mitchell) lifted from the first series, and Kim plays her with feisty energy. Choi is fantastic as Appa but wife Umma (Namju Go) is shadowy, not nearly as characterful as on screen. Mona Camille\u2019s set is such an exact replica of a local supermarket, with its lotto card advert, drinks fridge and linoleum-covered aisles, it is its own wonder. The delight is in the detail, right down to the sound of the electric bell as customers enter an invisible door. For fans of the TV show, there is deja vu in some scenes which are also exact replicas, such as the skit about the Honda parked outside which reveals Appa\u2019s grudge against the Japanese (\u201cIn 1904 Japan attacked Korea\u201d), and the \u201csteal or no steal\u201d scene, involving a Black man whom Appa identifies as a thief, and is one example of the show\u2019s edgy race satire. These scenes carry the sense of a show delivering its \u201cbest bits\u201d rather than offering something entirely original. Yet it works, and is still funny the second time around \u2013 as a repeat episode of Friends might be. Theatre has increasingly started to adapt television shows or feel episodic in their script. This is the apex of that trend \u2013 theatre-vision of sorts, irresistible in its appeal, cannily capturing a theatregoing audience and their couch-bound counterparts. \u2022 At Park theatre, London, until 10 February",

        "body": "\u201cAre there any London cowgirls out there tonight?\u201d ventures Molly Tuttle, the Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter who is reinvigorating the bluegrass tradition with a future-facing style of storytelling. Warming up a largely sedate audience in Cadogan Hall for Australian guitar virtuoso Tommy Emmanuel, by the time she\u2019d finished with them, they were awakened rangers ready to grab the bull by the horns. Renowned for her acrobatic skill with the guitar, effortlessly moving from crosspicking to flatpicking and clawhammer strums (\u201cI know we\u2019re all guitar nerds here\u201d), she plays it with the ease of meeting an old friend. Though her fables of life on the open road, matters of the heart and cannabis farmers in the Blue Ridge Mountains are usually embroidered by her band Golden Highway, tonight, she plays solo \u2013 but this is far from a stripped-back performance. She mines the instrument for the bass and rhythm in remarkable self-sufficiency, galloping through the valleys of El Dorado and San Joaquin drawn from her latest album City of Gold. Tuttle may know how to sing the high lonesome, but she performs her songs grinning ear to ear as if letting you in on a secret, often throwing in a wink for good measure. Her rendition of the sprightly sing-along Side Saddle, an anthem of spirited independence defying those who say \u201ca girl can\u2019t ride\u201d, has the fun and intimacy of a campfire jam. Calling on bluegrass camaraderie, her audience, at first placid, were now all too willing to take up her invitation to whistle along. She reinvents the Rolling Stones\u2019 She\u2019s A Rainbow, drawn from her 2020 covers album \u2026but i\u2019d rather be with you. Without compromising on the song\u2019s joy, she transmutes its original psychedelia into earthy, Appalachian charm. Invited to join childhood hero Tommy Emmanuel at the end of his performance, together they played the title song from her Grammy-winning album Crooked Tree. Watching them play their guitars in lockstep, there is no distinction between student and master: with flair and flavour that is entirely her own, if you could bottle it, you\u2019d buy two. \u2022 At Palace theatre, Southend, with Tommy Emmanuel on 14 January, and touring",

        "body": "A major hats off to New Movement Collective for pulling this off. Sixty dancers, musicians and singers, four new music and dance works and a stunning setting, formerly part of the Royal Arsenal, with a catwalk-like stage bisecting the room. It\u2019s loaded with ambition and class, not just the ingredients but the way the whole evening is designed. We start with two musical works: the hushed echoes of Andrea Balency-B\u00e9arn\u2019s Appels, then baritone Ross Ramgobin singing Yshani Perinpanayagam\u2019s setting of John Cage\u2019s love letters to Merce Cunningham. \u201cMy dearest Merce, I\u2019m writing a new piece ... and the only one I can imagine listening to it is you.\u201d The dancers are woven into the music before setting out on their own adventure, each piece follows the next without pause (or applause) building an absorbing atmosphere absolutely fitting the mood of the central feature, Les Noces. The original Les Noces \u2013 music by Stravinsky, dance by Bronislava Nijinska \u2013 premiered a century ago, the story of a Russian peasant wedding, it\u2019s a chilling picture of a forced marriage and a powerful piece of protofeminism. This new work, choreographed collectively by the performers, leans on ideas of community and its dutiful or surprising bonds, the dancers entangled or drawn together in unison, picking out rhythms from the musical layers, while individuals briefly break free from the group. The dancers of New Movement Collective are mostly veterans of Rambert, with decades of embodied knowledge between them and their movement carries weight and purpose and nothing superfluous, unfussy lines like the well-ironed seams of their nicely tailored costumes. In fleeting imagery, their bolero jackets become props, tied into a rope or a bride\u2019s veil and train. But against the power of the original Les Noces, the strength of the theme and innovation of the language feels a little pale. Stravinsky\u2019s score, played in the original arrangement for four pianos and percussion, with the chorus of Opera Holland Park, is adrenalised and ominous. Excellent soprano soloist April Koyejo-Audiger gets it: the urgency, her ringing notes that impel you, \u201cListen!\u201d There\u2019s a lot to love in this richly interesting evening. \u2022 At Woolwich Works, 14 January",

        "body": "Ah January. Too many vowels, too little time, it rises baldly on the horizon, an awkward and needy wasteland. And we dash around upon it as if walking the dogs of our regrets, searching for our new selves in its bleak whiteness and swinging our dainty plastic bags of shit. We are looking for meaning or, failing that, some kind of structure within which we can enable change. A game, a routine, to help each other move forward with purpose. I have a suggestion. Forget new year resolutions, forget dry January (which mad cow came up with this, by the way, this idea that January, a month of relentless rain, anxiety and sorrow, would be a good time to face reality head on, without even a colourful cocktail to take the edge off? Without even a little paper umbrella to protect us?). Instead, embrace the January transfer window. As in football, so in life \u2013 you have one month in which to barter and negotiate to create a new identity; a better, sleeker, more winning you. The deadline for decisions is dead strict and counted down live on clocks across the internet. There is something inspiring about the urgency, the pressure. It becomes its own sport. But I am less interested in the million pound fates of Jadon Sancho or Aaron Ramsdale than I am in the urgent reshaping of mine and my friends\u2019 lives. These are the teams I support. These are the athletes who I will trek out in the rain for and stand shivering and singing for even as they lose. Their pain and their happiness and their decisions about paint colours for the bedroom, this is my sport, this is why I scroll, refresh, refresh. After a season of shared colds and bickering in Tescos along the south coast, many are eyeing relationship transfers, kissing a stranger in the smoking area, setting into motion the dramatic denouement of their current marriage. January is an excellent time to make your substitutions. Is it time? Look around. If you\u2019re ready to find a new lover, simply everybody else will look hot. That hiker in the head-to-toe waterproofs muttering there\u2019s no such thing as bad weather \u2013 yes. The suspicious checkout assistant who keeps their eyebrow fully raised when you\u2019re trying to return an unwanted gift from your cousin \u2013 yes. The delivery driver who asks if they can use your loo and fills the house with the smell of smoked meat \u2013 yes. Perhaps, instead of simply ushering in a replacement partner, you want to restructure the relationship itself and investigate polyamory, or consensual non-monogamy, or create a throuple or some other form of many syllabled entanglement. While news of such flexible experiments delights me, when I think about participating in such a relationship myself I am reminded of someone recently describing the special pain of cooking with garlic and how each clove has its own paperwork. But this admin is what the transfer window is perfect for: negotiate your terms, organise a medical and usher in a new signing, or a whole new team. I had a haircut recently, which, returning home, was a shock for a number of reasons, the most lasting being the realisation that I do not present as the person I believe I am. When I asked for a short, messy bob, I assumed the hairdresser would look at me and understand what I meant. That she would see, if not quite a mischievous young punk, then at least someone with memories of nighttimes past, rather than, as became clear when I looked in the mirror at the end after she\u2019d sculpted what she assumed was an appropriate cut, a middle-aged mum who had to rush back to get tea on. It has spurred me to pay more attention to my appearance and use this transfer window to switch out my current look, a sort of \u201cslouching towards Brent Cross\u201d and replace it with something altogether more chic and dynamic. Rather than dieting or detoxing or any of that absolute silliness, what I am planning to do is alter the look in my eyes. Out with jolly exhaustion and in with a steely gaze, alert, reckless, a certain wild suspense. I am spending January learning how to style this new haircut less cosily, I am throwing out another bag of jumpers and I am adopting a new walk, the walk of somebody taller who has made better decisions. I am using eye cream at night and tanning drops in the day. In February, I intend to return to the hairdresser and test my new squad, by which, of course, I mean, see if this fresh combination of dignity and sass will lead to me emerging with the hair of a modern Debbie Harry, rather than Debbie, Harry\u2019s mum who always wears a travel bumbag containing a massive set of keys. Join me. Switch out grand ambition for focused slog, swap tired pettiness for rich passion, untested prejudices for educated compassion, buy in the bravery to be disliked, switch in pleasure: drink, smoke, sleep, sell off abstinence, bitterness, guilt. March out on to the pitch in February transformed \u2013 bigger, better, stronger, in a chic little haircut and absolutely exquisite shorts.

        "body": "Dating in later life can be daunting, but it\u2019s also full of positives and potential excitement. \u201cWe are usually better positioned when we\u2019re older to have a clearer idea of where we are in life, what it is we would ideally like and what we\u2019ve got to give as well,\u201d says Jo Hemmings, a psychologist and relationship coach. You may have more free time, perhaps more money; you\u2019re not constrained by pressure to start a family. Whether you are looking for abundant casual sex, or marriage number whatever, here experts offer advice on getting back out there. Are you ready? If you are new to dating in later life, you are probably finding yourself in this situation as a result of something painful: divorce or bereavement. However a long relationship ends, there will be a feeling of grief. \u201cSociety doesn\u2019t like grief,\u201d says Andrew G Marshall, a marital therapist and the host of The Meaningful Life podcast. \u201cWe want to make it better straight away and we try to parcel everybody up into a couple again. The problem is, if you date too soon, you bring all the old relationship issues into the new one, or you bring the ghost of the old relationship. It could be that there is quite a bit of recuperation or learning to do.\u201d Therapy may help, but Marshall says it could just be a case of checking \u201cinside yourself to see if you are ready.\u201d Think about what you actually want from a relationship Perhaps it\u2019s not a new relationship you are after. \u201cIt could be that now is the time to climb Mount Kilimanjaro or to learn to play the banjo or whatever it is that is going to bring new energy into your life, rather than necessarily a new person,\u201d says Marshall. You may find you meet someone as a result of this new pursuit anyway. Perhaps you actually want a new friendship circle and revived social life, rather than a romantic partner. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding out what is right for you,\u201d says Cate Campbell, a relationship and psychosexual therapist. \u201cSome people have found an enormous amount of freedom in being single and getting into a relationship can take that away. What you want may also change over time.\u201d Let go of guilt It is understandable to feel guilty about getting into a new relationship after a bereavement. It\u2019s a big generalisation, says Campbell, \u201cbut men often want to be in another good relationship quickly, while women can feel guilty about moving on. Children, family and friends can be quite judgmental as well.\u201d Again, it comes back to: are you ready? You don\u2019t need to follow the script Sometimes, says Campbell, older clients \u201cwant to follow old-fashioned relationship trajectories. One thing that puts people off dating is the thought that they have got to move somebody in, or move the relationship along in the way that they would have when they were younger. You don\u2019t have to do that any more.\u201d Marriage or living together doesn\u2019t have to be the end-goal of a new relationship. \u201cI think it doesn\u2019t even occur to some people that they have choices. Once they realise they are in charge of their future, they are liberated.\u201d Join an app Apps have radically changed the dating landscape, but if you\u2019re new to it, Hemmings is reassuring. \u201cTechnologically, dating has changed, but the essence hasn\u2019t. You want to meet someone with whom you connect, who you find attractive, has a great sense of humour, shares your interests, is funny, kind \u2026\u201d Apps, she says, are \u201can opportunity, not something to fear\u201d. There is a broad range, from the traditional Match and Hinge (aimed at people looking for relationships) to Tinder and Grindr (more casual) to Bumble (where women make the first move in heterosexual pairings). There are also age-specific apps, such as OurTime which is run by Match, aimed at the over-50s. Enlist a friend Writing a dating profile is cringe-inducing, particularly the first few times you do it. Hemmings suggests getting a friend to describe you. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to become self-deprecating as we get older and undersell ourselves. And get a friend to take photos of you: your profile picture should be a nice one, smiling, where you look good, relaxed. Your other pictures could be holidays or things you might be doing with other people.\u201d Broaden your horizons \u201cBe realistic about what you want. Educational standards, political views; these are things that are pretty much settled by the time you\u2019re 60-plus,\u201d says Campbell. It\u2019s normal and desirable to have some non-negotiables, but try to be open-minded. Maybe you have such a narrow list of requirements \u201cthat nobody matches with you because you\u2019ve been too specific. Don\u2019t be overly judgmental.\u201d Talk first Relatively swift but not overly hasty is the rule when it comes to making a date \u2013 especially when you have connected via a website or app. With endless messages, says Hemmings, \u201cthere is the danger of becoming pen pals\u201d. After a few messages, it\u2019s a good idea to speak on the phone or do a video call. \u201cYou can infer a lot from somebody\u2019s voice \u2013 the tone, their humour, their character.\u201d Be clear on your boundaries \u201cDating makes you aware of all sorts of boundaries,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cWill you accept this behaviour or not? Are you happy to go out and have coffee with somebody who is going to be meeting another person for coffee an hour later?\u201d Don\u2019t feel as if you have to do something just because someone asks you, adds Campbell. Meeting for coffee or a short daytime date is better than dinner, says Hemmings, and have somewhere you need to be afterwards. \u201cIt adds to a sense of security, and takes away some of that fear \u2013 you know you have some boundaries in place before you go and that helps people relax.\u201d Are you exclusive? Dating apps have normalised the idea of seeing multiple people casually. It is perfectly possible that the person you are seeing regularly is also seeing other people, says Marshall, \u201cwithout feeling that they\u2019re doing anything unusual\u201d. Ask yourself if you are comfortable with this idea and be prepared to have a conversation about agreeing not to see other people (which may not go the way you want it to). Likewise, it\u2019s also fine to meet lots of people. \u201cYou should be honest, but treat them with respect,\u201d says Hemmings. If you want to end the date, or decide against meeting up in the first place, \u201cbe kind, but firm\u201d. If you are keen, be clear, advises Campbell. \u201cIt\u2019s no good trying to be coy because online, people will move on to someone else if you look as if you\u2019re not interested.\u201d Be open to meeting someone in real life You don\u2019t need to go near an app \u2013 the idea of meeting someone serendipitously isn\u2019t entirely extinct. Advice about starting a new hobby still stands. \u201cWhen you are doing something you love, you\u2019re more likely to be present and able to make an authentic connection with somebody,\u201d says Vicki Pavitt, a dating and relationship coach. Also, she adds, if you are a heterosexual woman and you\u2019re afraid to make the first move, ask yourself why. \u201cWe\u2019re now dropping those gendered scripts and embracing more of an equal approach.\u201d Practice being approachable Smile, says Pavitt. \u201cHave an openness in your body language, like smiling and making eye contact.\u201d It can help to have some ice-breaker comments or questions in mind \u201cif it\u2019s not a natural thing for you\u201d. Paying a genuine compliment is a good way to get a conversation started (but don\u2019t be creepy: \u201clook for reciprocity in how someone responds, and signs that someone is open to being approached, like a returned smile\u201d). Open-ended questions can help to encourage a meaningful response and you can improve social skills with practise. \u201cWhen you\u2019re getting a coffee, chat to people. If that is too much of a leap, just practice making eye contact. That can really help to flex that muscle of connection. Also let it be imperfect \u2013 don\u2019t put pressure on yourself to suddenly be this great conversationalist.\u201d Most importantly, practise listening. Listen to your children \u2013 but up to a point Teenage or even grownup children may be hostile to the idea of you dating. There can be legitimate, if slightly unsavoury, worries about inheritances, but often the bigger barriers are emotional, particularly, says Campbell, if they have already lost one parent \u201cthrough death, or if they\u2019ve moved away, or gone off with a new partner. They may fear losing the remaining parent. Sometimes children are unreasonable, but sometimes they are just frightened and they love you and want to be close to you. So listen to what they are saying, even if at the end of that you say: \u2018Actually, this is making me happy.\u2019\u201d Create a fulfilling sex life There can be many anxieties associated with a new sexual relationship, from body-image insecurities to concerns about sexual dysfunction, such as erectile problems or vaginal dryness and pain. Psychosexual and relationship therapist Lottie Passell-Syms sees it all. \u201cOne thing I ask [clients] to do is to stop criticising themselves,\u201d she says. If there is a loss of self-esteem and confidence, \u201cwhere has that message come from? It might be from your family, where you were not \u2018good enough\u2019. Can you accept yourself enough to be able to give yourself to somebody else?\u201d For physiological concerns, she suggests people see their GP, but adds many issues of sexual dysfunction can be psychological. \u201cIt could be shame, guilt, trauma or a specific incident.\u201d As we get older, there may have to be adjustments, such as using different positions, and don\u2019t expect what worked in a previous relationship to be the same in a new one. \u201cCommunication is the key to all of this,\u201d says Passell-Syms. \u201cJust because you like something or want something, it doesn\u2019t mean you can have it; you have got to have a conversation with the other person. We still need to put boundaries in place and say: \u2018I\u2019m not ready for this part of it.\u2019\u201d And if you are having sex, use condoms \u2013 rates of sexually transmitted infections among the over-65s are on the rise. Work on your confidence Separation, bereavement, long periods of being unhappily alone and hormonal changes can all sap confidence and, for some people, insecurities can grow with age. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have confidence, you need to ask yourself why,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cIf it\u2019s because you have always got by on your looks and now you\u2019re worried about the loss of that, then it is possibly time to find out what else you have to offer.\u201d Counselling might be useful, and being in a good place, mentally, will improve the chances of successful dating. \u201cUnderstand yourself better, so you can be more yourself rather than some jolly person that you send out with a mask on.\u201d",

        "body": "A legislative showdown is brewing in Ohio after Governor Mike DeWine split from his party to veto a bill that would impose substantial new restrictions on the lives of trans children. The bill, HB 68, prohibits doctors from providing gender-affirming care to trans youths. It also blocks transgender female student athletes from participating in girls\u2019 sports. On Friday, DeWine said signing HB 68 into law would signal that \u201cthe government knows better what is medically best for a child than the two people who love that child the most: the parents\u201d. Ohio hospitals do not offer gender-affirming care to young patients without the consent of a parent or guardian. \u201cParents are making decisions about the most precious thing in their life, their child, and none of us should underestimate the gravity and the difficulty of those decisions,\u201d the governor said. \u201cMany parents have told me that their child would be dead today if they had not received the treatment they received from an Ohio children\u2019s hospital.\u201d The veto by DeWine, a Republican, marked a rare victory for LGBTQ+ advocates, who spent the past year battling a historic rise in anti-trans legislation and rhetoric across the United States. Maria Bruno, policy director for Equality Ohio, said the governor\u2019s veto was \u201ca relief for Ohio\u2019s transgender youth, parents, healthcare professionals and educators who can finally take a breath and get back to their lives\u201d. But that relief could be short-lived. Top Ohio Republicans, including the secretary of state, Frank LaRose, are now urging the state legislature to reverse the governor\u2019s decision by overriding his veto. \u201cWe have a duty to protect safety and fair competition for female athletes and to protect children from being subjected to permanent, life-altering medical procedures before the age of 18,\u201d LaRose said. The Republican speaker, Jason Stephens, announced this week that the Ohio house would reconvene on 10 January, weeks earlier than scheduled, in an attempt to revive the bill before the official start of the 2024 legislative session. Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers of the Ohio legislature, meaning Stephens\u2019 push to sidestep the governor is likely to succeed. \u201cIt is disappointing that the governor vetoed House Bill 68,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe bill sponsors, and the house, have dedicated nearly three years to get the bill right.\u201d Despite Stephens\u2019 insistence that HB 68 is a tool to \u201cempower parents and protect children,\u201d hundreds of Ohio families, including the parents of transgender children, have spoken out in fierce opposition to the GOP-backed proposal. Last year, the Ohio house received more than 600 written testimonies from people who oppose the ban on gender-affirming care, compared with just 56 in support of the legislation. In her testimony against the bill, Minna Zelch, the parent of a transgender daughter, asked why she and her husband \u201care qualified to make other medical decisions for our children, such as if they should have surgery for a broken bone or take ADHD medication, but we\u2019re not qualified to decide if and when they should receive gender care?\u201d Zelch added: \u201cAll transgender kids and their families deserve the basic right of deciding what medical care they receive.\u201d",

        "body": "This year\u2019s award for the first shopkeeper to cite the weather in its Christmas profits warning goes to JD Sports. Specifically, the group didn\u2019t care for how mild it has been \u2013 not good for shifting fleeces \u2013 although the same temperatures didn\u2019t seem to bother Next, which turned in its usual upgrades to forecasts. So the story probably lies in the other factors mentioned by JD. The group blamed \u201cmore cautious consumer spending\u201d and \u201can elevated level of promotional activity during the peak trading period\u201d. Possible translation: more and more punters think the entire \u2018athleisure\u2019 industry \u2013 from big brands such as Nike and Adidas, to the likes of JD itself \u2013 had elevated prices to silly levels. Who could blame them? When the retail price of the latest \u201cessential\u201d variation on an old line of Nike trainers is \u00a3175, more than a few would-be buyers may conclude that a purchase is actually inessential, or decide to wait until the product goes on sale. In the past, the industry has tended to dismiss such concerns as the fogeyish thinking of those who don\u2019t understand the must-have status of the buzzier fashion ranges. And it has usually been able to demonstrate its point: the hype machine in crossover sportswear is a wonder of modern marketing. Yet this Christmas season seems to have been marked by a mass outbreak of late discounting by big brands and retailers, with JD obliged to join in. The intriguing aspect is that JD\u2019s profits warning, like Nike\u2019s before Christmas, comes at a moment when the trading backdrop wasn\u2019t obviously unhelpful. Overall employment levels, it used to be said, dictate the real incomes of the core 16 to 24-year-old target market and, on that front in the UK at least, there isn\u2019t a problem, notwithstanding wider cost-of-living pressures. As recently as late-September, JD said it expected headline pre-tax profits for this financial year to arrive at \u00a31.04bn, so the latest prediction of \u00a3915m-\u00a3935m represents a \u00a3100m-plus gap that has appeared over the peak season. That\u2019s chunky. JD could still report a 1.8% improvement in like-for-like revenues in the last five months of 2023 and, with the contribution from new stores, overall revenues should still be 8% higher over the course of a financial year that closes in early February. This is still a growth company making a very substantial profit and enjoying the benefit of a diversified revenue base that is split roughly evenly between the UK, the rest of Europe and the US. Nor is JD\u2019s closeness to major brands, and thus its ability to get sweetheart access to the top lines, about to disappear. Yet the 23% slump in the share price still looks rational. There is a new uncertainty here. Has the industry\u2019s phenomenal ability to crank the fashion handle and maintain pricing power reached a natural ceiling for now? JD didn\u2019t venture a forecast for the 2024-25 year. Very wise: the mood among athleisure consumers seems to have turned very suddenly.",

        "body": "I could watch Sarah Lancashire and Isabella Rossellini argue about the propriety of fish-shaped pastry for much longer than an hour, but apparently Julia has other characters and would like us to spend some time with them. Lancashire\u2019s performance as the chef and author Julia Child is one of this arch, twinkly show\u2019s main draws, but by the time we rejoin her in season two, her TV show The French Chef has triumphed over the odds, making her a star, so now the drama must find other sources of tension. Franco-American disagreements about what constitutes a cassoulet seem as good a place to start as any. Julia is a rich and highly stylised show, which lingers as lovingly on its dialogue as it does on food. It begins its second outing with a lengthy period of separation for the bulk of the cast, dividing its time between France, where Julia and Paul (David Hyde Pierce, a perfect match for Lancashire) have escaped the madness of fame, and Boston, where the 1960s explosion in popular culture is picked over and mined for drama, from the sexism of the TV world to the power dynamics of book publishing, via several diversions to the anti-Vietnam war movement. France offers the more sumptuous scenes, and initially, Julia is best when it lingers there. Julia is researching her next book with teacher and friend Simone \u201cSimca\u201d Beck (Rossellini). \u201cIt is good to have industrious wives,\u201d notes Simca\u2019s husband, Jean, to Paul, as they sip drinks on deckchairs in the garden. But Julia is cooking under the weight of expectation for perhaps the first time in her life. The network WGBH would like a second season of The French Chef, and her editors Blanche and Judith would like a second cookbook. Julia is reluctant to return to the US to face the music, so Judith and eventually Avis (Bebe Neuwirth) are sent over to hurry things along. A little hurrying along is surely necessary. The pace, to start with, is gentle, and as viewers, we are Paul and Jean, lounging in the garden, waiting for the main course to be served up. It leaves the impression that it is spreading itself thinly, particularly in Boston. Director Russ (Fran Kranz) is now trying to make it in the world of documentaries. Network bossHunter (Robert Joy), having produced a hit, finds himself under extra pressure, both to manage his hit effectively and to produce even more of them. But its main concerns are the women. Producer Alice (Brittany Bradford) is having to do her own job, despite not knowing when her French Chef will return, as well as helping the men with their roles, while taking the blame for Hunter\u2019s terrible ideas and being denied access to the big decisions. Russ is replaced by a female director, Elaine (Rachel Bloom), who has fled the more successful CBS and must fend off the unwelcome advances of her colleagues. Meanwhile Judith must pick up the slack for the ailing Blanche, while not appearing to undermine her boss. Can they have it all? What would Betty Friedan think? Julia occasionally forgets to be subtle. Episode one ends with Bob Dylan\u2019s The Times They Are a-Changin\u2019, just in case the message wasn\u2019t loud enough, and the voice of the modern day sometimes creeps in. Hunter is desperate for \u201cnew content, yesterday!\u201d, while Alice is \u201cone girl, in a sea of men\u201d. It takes a little too long to rev up, and there is a sense that the early episodes have overloaded plates, which leads to less Julia on screen. Without her, the story feels adrift. It isn\u2019t until the fourth episode that the old gang are finally brought back together. When it plumps for acid over sugar, however, it finds its form. Stockard Channing makes a brief, bright appearance as Frannie, an oil heiress from Ohio, travelling with chef and author James Beard, who is surprised when a dish of his own arrives at the house. At a fractious dinner, where the guests are supposed to adjudicate between the warring Julia and Simca by voting for the food they like best, Frannie delivers a wonderfully spiky speech about dependence and what it means to be \u201ckept\u201d by another person, laying the foundations for marital disruption. Simca, meanwhile, cannot abide Julia\u2019s Americanised tweaks of the French classics. \u201cI love her like my sister,\u201d she declares. \u201cYou hate your sister,\u201d Jean reminds her. Julia is a uniquely indulgent watch, erudite and gorgeous and heady. It isn\u2019t without its flaws: season two needs more Julia, and it takes its time to work on the winning recipe, but it is such a warm pleasure that it\u2019s easy to simply sink in to its richness, pastry fish and all. \u2022 Julia is on Sky Atlantic and Now in the UK and on Binge in Australia",

        "body": "In 2021, the Golden Globes were almost sidelined into extinction. A boycott by stars and their publicists following years of scandal came to a head when it became evident not one of the voters was Black. Celebrities refused to attend and broadcasters to cooperate. The ceremony was held behind closed doors. No press. No red carpet. No impact. At the time, the general reaction was: good riddance. What merit was there in being celebrated by such a discredited society? And isn\u2019t all that hoopla a bit distasteful in the age of Covid? A year later, and the stars and cameras flooded enthusiastically back, lapping up a ceremony of gongs, glamour and endless mea culpas via a host \u2013 Jerrod Carmichael \u2013 who readily confessed he\u2019d been hired as a conspicuous symbol of the organisation\u2019s overhaul. Why the U-turn? Had everyone been satisfied by the Globes\u2019 admission of error and hiring a handful of diverse new voters? Perhaps. Also possible is that Hollywood noticed that without this raucous youngster to kick off proceedings, awards season lost a lot of its energy. Momentum sputtered. Actors missed out on the chance to \u201caudition\u201d for those more prestigious gongs still being voted on \u2013 either by frocks, charm or assuming a role as an unfairly snubbed loser. Marketing opportunities for movies still in cinemas were lost. The film industry might not respect the Golden Globes, but it didn\u2019t know what it had until it was nearly gone. So the awards\u2019 unreliability as an indication of quality is no longer of concern. Nor is its increasing shakiness as a bellwether of Oscars success. Last year, only three of the 14 Golden Globe film category winners went on to pick up Oscars: best animation Pinocchio, and Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019s Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. And while that film swept the Academy Awards, the titles that won the Golden Globes\u2019 best film trophies \u2013 The Banshees of Inisherin (best comedy or musical) and The Fabelmans (best drama) \u2013 went home from the Oscars empty-handed. So, Hollywood has reconciled with the Globes\u2019 lack of class and, potentially, taste? The benefits of attending still outweigh the embarrassments. Such a shift in thinking can perhaps be best illustrated by comparing what happened when each body made a blatant play for the mainstream. In 2018, the Academy introduced a new category recognising \u201cpopular\u201d movies, with hefty box office an eligibility requirement. So ferocious was the backlash, which many cited as evidence of selling out to superhero culture, plans were abandoned less than a month after being announced. This year\u2019s Globes will see the presentation of the inaugural award for cinematic and box office achievement for films grossing at least $100m (\u00a379m) domestically and $150m internationally. The new prize was announced last September. Nobody batted an eyelid. With cinema still so vulnerable, beggars can\u2019t be choosers.",

        "body": "A New Zealand man who survived more than 23 hours in cold waters and an encounter with a shark has been rescued after fishers spotted the reflection from his watch. Will Fransen, 61, had set off on a solo fishing trip from Whangamat\u0101 on the Coromandel Peninsula, south of Auckland, on 2 January, but was yanked overboard after hooking what he suspected was a marlin. He was unable to catch his idling 12-metre boat as it floated away, and was dragged by currents as he tried to swim to the Alderman Islands. Whangamat\u0101 police sergeant Will Hamilton said it was an \u201cabsolute miracle\u201d the man was still alive after the ordeal. Fransen told the New Zealand Herald he was \u201cpessimistic\u201d of his chances of survival. \u201cI grabbed the line with the marlin attached and started pulling the line out. I tried pulling my way towards the boat only to have the line slip out of my hand, which is pretty gutting, because next thing my boat\u2019s idling over the horizon and I\u2019m treading water. \u201cWhen I went in the water I knew the chances of somebody even knowing I was in the water were pretty slim. I was pretty pessimistic from the outset,\u201d he said. \u201cI just kept staying alive.\u201d Fransen was too exhausted to keep swimming, so endured a cold and difficult night in the water, at one point seeing a shark coming close and having \u201ca sniff\u201d before swimming off. \u201cI gave up and just treaded water and watched the beautiful sunset overhead,\u201d he said. The angler was saved the next day when the three fishers noticed a reflection in the water and went over in their boat to investigate. They found the exhausted and desperate man in the waters off Mayor Island, after he attemped to catch their attention by using the reflection of the sun from his watch. Hamilton said he was taken back to Whangamat\u0101 and treated for hypothermia and exhaustion. \u201cIt is an absolute miracle the fisherman is still alive after the ordeal. Without the quick actions of the three gentlemen that retrieved him, this certainly would have had a tragic outcome,\u201d Hamilton said. He thanked the fishers for saving the man\u2019s life, and added that authorities were still looking for his boat. \u201cThe boaties did an absolute stellar job and without a doubt saved this man\u2019s life. \u201cFew stories end the way this one did, and police cannot thank the eagle-eyed trio enough for making the call to investigate something that looked out of the ordinary. \u201cThe boat may be missing, but the fisherman still has his watch,\u201d Hamilton added. Rescuer James Mcdonnell told Newshub a \u201cseries of fortunate events\u201d led them to see the watch \u201cglistening, probably 600 metres away\u201d. \u201cI mean, we were 10 miles [16km] off the back of Mayor Island and not a boat in sight, but sure enough, as we got closer, it was quite obvious that someone was waving their arms,\u201d he said. Rescue boat skipper Max White said their priority was to get the man aboard and to keep him awake. \u201cWe had a big cooler bag and just wrapped him up in as many layers as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s desperate for water \u2026 so I had a bit of warm water on the boat and some cranberry juice \u2026 Give him what we can and try and get him talking and just make sure that he stayed awake as best possible.\u201d",

But at the end of the first series, a tearjerking letter soothes Danny, who decides to accept help from Jack and stay with his family for the summer. \u201cI\u2019m writing Big Boys for people who have gone \u2018I wish I\u2019d said that at that time\u2019,\u201d says Rooke. \u201cIt\u2019s me writing in hindsight.\u201d If this sounds heavy, that\u2019s because at times it is \u2013 and how refreshing to see men\u2019s mental health explored so freely. But for every weepy moment, there\u2019s a raucous gag to make you spit out your tea (like the moment a student union rep confuses ISIS with ASOS). It\u2019s also loaded with fun 00s pop culture references \u2013 a love letter to a time when Alison Hammond did Strictly, Holly and Phil ruled daytime TV and the \u201cLive, Laugh, Love\u201d sign was everywhere. Season two picks up straight after the first: Danny and Peggy have been smoking weed together all summer, and Jack is determined to live his new life as a confidently gay man. \u201cI\u2019ve finally come out but my sex life is still a disaster,\u201d he puffs after being poked in the eye by a pub DJ\u2019s penis in the loo. Danny, meanwhile, wants to be with on/off love interest Corrine (Scottish Bafta-winner Izuka Hoyle), but now that he\u2019s got his erection back, he also just \u201cloves the puss\u201d. After failing to find a new house together, they cram back into the blue shed ready for another turbulent year at uni. When I meet up with the gang again a few weeks ahead of the show\u2019s release, there\u2019s no sign of second album nerves. \u201cMe and Phoebe Waller-Bridge have just been texting,\u201d says Rooke casually, followed by a knowing laugh of disbelief. \u201cShe just asked me to write a play for her.\u201d Waller-Bridge is not the only famous fan. Russell T Davies was so impressed that he contacted Rooke and spoke with him over FaceTime to help go through his contract. \u201cHe\u2019s so kind and generous.\u201d Richard Curtis also invited him to dinner to ask for help producing a project, while Derry Girls creator Lisa McGee has become a mentor. Self Esteem singer Rebecca Lucy Taylor is a great friend too, and gave him the advice: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop fucking putting success down. You fucking won an award.\u201d But the personal hero that topped them all? \u201cWhen Kathy Burke tweeted about the show, I just took the day off.\u201d Llewellyn had already enjoyed a taste of this sort of success after his breakout role as \u201cwee English fella\u201d James in Derry Girls. At last year\u2019s Baftas, the next level of fame really hit when he had to choose which of his two nominated shows\u2019 tables to sit at (he chose Derry Girls, who won, but joined the Big Boys lot for dessert). \u201cSometimes I do forget that I am an actor,\u201d he says, in his very unassuming way. \u201cWhen someone stares at me I\u2019m like \u2018What are you looking at?\u2019 I do freak myself out.\u201d The real pinch-me moment, though, was when Big Boys featured on the Gogglebox Pride special: \u201cSeeing Rylan and H from Steps react to Jack\u2019s coming out scene and how much it meant to them? It was really beautiful.\u201d Llewellyn was first introduced to Rooke by their mutual friend Nicola Coughlan after his comedy show. How did it feel later auditioning to play his mate\u2019s mate? \u201cJack is a very light-up-the-room person,\u201d he says. But, despite sharing the same curly mop of hair, he takes on a certain version of him: \u201cMy Jack is still trying to come out of his shell, you know, and it\u2019s when he was younger and trying to discover himself and be comfortable.\u201d There\u2019s a clear mutual respect between the pair, with Rooke calling Llewellyn the hardest working person there because his dyslexia means he needs to spend more time with the scripts. \u201cI do find it tough when there\u2019s a fresh draft and we need to shoot the day after,\u201d says Llewellyn. \u201cBut it\u2019s a very safe space. It always works out because everyone\u2019s just looking out for each other.\u201d Pointing, who started out as a standup, met Rooke on the comedy circuit nearly seven years ago, and they bonded in a kebab shop. \u201cYou know when you meet someone and you feel like \u2018Oh, I\u2019m home\u2019?\u201d he remembers. They immediately started talking about developing Rooke\u2019s series. \u201cLook, how many times have I been half cut and some other performer or writer has said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this idea for a show\u2019?\u201d But Rooke realised he had found his perfect \u201cstraight mate\u201d Danny. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I was exactly like his friend,\u201d says Pointing. \u201cBut I think he saw something in me.\u201d The success of playing Danny \u2013 along with his compelling blend of deadpan wit and laddish charm (enough to make an interviewer burst into a five-minute laughing fit with a sarcastic comment on how the \u201cstraight male community\u201d isn\u2019t represented enough) \u2013 has boosted Pointing\u2019s career over the last two years. He starred in the BBC\u2019s recent Agatha Christie adaptation, and won hearts as a single dad looking for love in Sky Comedy\u2019s modern romcom Smothered. He and Llewellyn are almost in danger of being typecast as really lovely blokes. Would they ever play the villain? \u201cYeah sure!\u201d says Pointing. \u201cI used to do a really unpleasant person in my comedy. But I\u2019d look around the room and think \u2018Oh I\u2019ve just ruined everyone\u2019s evening.\u2019\u201d Llewellyn, meanwhile, would just \u201clove to play an adult\u201d and for people to say \u201c\u2018What the hell? But that\u2019s the Wee English Fella!\u2019\u201d What he\u2019s most keen on, though, is to work with McGee again on a soppy romcom. Beyond these triumphs, the most meaningful thing to happen to the boys is the open-arms response from not just the LGBTQ+ community but also straight men who have taken something positive from the show. \u201cThe most important thing is when someone\u2019s like, \u2018My husband\u2019s a builder and he loves Danny!\u2019\u201d says Rooke. It\u2019s a big middle finger to the commissioners who rejected Big Boys because they would ask, \u201cDo we believe this gay guy would have this straight best friend?\u201d Pointing adds that, while there are lots of posters on the tube and in pubs these days about men\u2019s mental health, many still don\u2019t know how to articulate it. \u201cMaybe the show helps a little bit.\u201d How about a third season, then? Everyone is keen, obviously \u2013 Rooke even admits that he\u2019s obsessed with the ratings figures. \u201cMy aim is [like] Gavin and Stacey vibes. I want a huge span: that\u2019s my dream.\u201d Then again, after turning 30 last year, he also says he has \u201cmilked this story\u201d to death. He\u2019d like to focus on writing characters inspired by the working-class women in his life. He adores his mum \u2013 who always believed in him but also prepared him for working-class failure in a very middle-class industry \u2013 and says the best thing about all of this is that he\u2019s finally been able to buy her a fridge. \u201cShe\u2019s got like three framed Bafta-nominee posters on the wall at home. I can just tell that for her, it\u2019s the best thing.\u201d There\u2019s only one disappointing thing about this second season: no one has yet met Alison Hammond, who Jack\u2019s goldfish was named after. \u201cI don\u2019t think she likes it,\u201d says Rooke. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine she would. I think it would be weird being written up in a sitcom as a fish.\u201d Series two of Big Boys starts on Channel 4 on 14 January. Join Jack Rooke and the cast of Big Boys on 15 January for a livestreamed Guardian Live event where they will be talking about the series. Tickets available here.",

        "body": "Parker Posey and Jason Isaacs are among the new cast members announced for the third season of HBO\u2019s critically acclaimed comedy drama The White Lotus. The pair has been revealed alongside the Iron Man star Leslie Bibb, True Detective\u2019s Michelle Monaghan, Dom Hetrakul and Tayme Thapthimthong. The six actors join the season one star Natasha Rothwell, whom Variety confirmed would reprise her Emmy-nominated role as the beleaguered luxury hotel masseuse Belinda back in April 2023. Exact plot details for the third season, set to begin production in Thailand in February, are being kept under wraps, although it is expected the new outing will again follow a set of guests at a different fictional White Lotus hotel property. The creator, writer and director Mike White will again serve as executive producer and director, along with David Bernad and Mark Kamine as executive producers. White has previously teased that the third season will delve into eastern spirituality, potentially aligning with Belinda\u2019s interest in wellness. \u201cThe first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,\u201d White said in an HBO clip tied to the season 2 finale. \u201cI think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and eastern religion and spirituality.\u201d Rothwell, recently seen in Wonka, has already teased a surprising season in-store. \u201cI gasped out loud a minimum of five times, and this was just me reading them,\u201d she told Vanity Fair last month. \u201cThe scripts are a testament to Mike\u2019s skill and ability to tell the most smart and entertaining stories.\u201d HBO has partnered with the Tourism Authority of Thailand to support filming and promotion of the third season. \u201cWe are pleased to partner with the Tourism Authority of Thailand to execute Mike\u2019s creative vision and showcase all that the beautiful country of Thailand has to offer, as the next group of guests check in to the White Lotus,\u201d said Janet Graham Borba, executive vice-president of production for HBO and Max, in a statement reported by Variety. Thailand has long been considered one of the world\u2019s favorite filming locations,\u201d added Thapanee Kiatphaibool, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand. \u201cThe White Lotus project will certainly strengthen the kingdom\u2019s status as a preferred filming destination and a beacon of experience-based tourism, inspiring even more visitors to amazing Thailand.\u201d The White Lotus was an instant critical hit since its debut in 2021 as a limited series \u2013 its first season, set in Hawaii, earned 20 Emmy nominations and 10 wins, including for best limited series. Its second season, set in Sicily, is up for 23 awards, including best drama, for the 2023 Emmys, which were postponed until 15 January.",

        "body": "Growing up, my childhood cat Honeybun was a big part of my life. She was so affectionate and always greeted me when I came home. Her loss affected me massively when she passed away in February last year. I loved her throughout her whole life, but she was particularly sweet in her later years. I thought to myself: when I have my own place, I\u2019ll adopt old cats to make sure they don\u2019t stay in cages at the end of their life. Last summer, I finally got my own flat in London and was ready to adopt. I came across a cat named Flossie through Cats Protection, a charity dedicated to rescuing and rehoming stray, unwanted or homeless animals. The website said she was a 27-year-old tortoiseshell. At the time, I thought it was an error and that she must be 17. Cats Protection told me she was still available to adopt and that no, she was in fact 27, the same age as me. It is weird to think that Flossie and I were born in the same year. When I adopted her, I thought she\u2019d only have a few months left, but felt comforted by the fact that she\u2019d at least spend them in a nice, warm flat, be fed well and get treats as well as a comfy bed. I wanted her to roam around and get the attention she deserved. To my surprise, I\u2019ve had her for over a year now and she\u2019s still going strong. Her birthday is 29 December, so she has just turned 28. Flossie is a small indoor cat who always wants attention. She\u2019s very friendly and will sit on anyone\u2019s lap straight away. The balcony is her sanctuary, especially when it\u2019s sunny. Though we\u2019re the same age, she\u2019s still my baby. She\u2019s my child, my best friend, my family. I come home and she\u2019s always there. She has her routine: waking up and loudly meowing at six in the morning for her breakfast, going for a nap, waking up again for some afternoon snacks and then having more naps. There are a few special toys she likes to play with. As soon as I get into bed, she climbs on my chest and then falls asleep on my lap. After a little nap on me, she\u2019ll move down near my feet for the rest of the night. I think she\u2019s lived so long primarily due to luck, and because she was loved by her previous owners. She does have a special diet now, but she\u2019s still very active \u2013 as active as you can be at her age. I bought her little stairs to get up on the sofa, but she hasn\u2019t used them at all; she still jumps everywhere. I found out Flossie was the world\u2019s oldest living cat when someone from Cats Protection later messaged me to say that they thought she might be. They had received vet\u2019s records confirming she was actually born in December 1995. I was surprised, but didn\u2019t think it would be as big a deal as it turned out to be. Guinness World Records came around to take pictures. A week later, pictures of me and Flossie were everywhere, and resulted in some lovely responses. A gentleman painted a picture of Flossie and sent it to Cats Protection, who forwarded it to me; he included a little toy mouse and some treats too. One of the most surreal and special moments was sitting on the sofa with Flossie and watching ourselves on TV. Obviously, she had no clue what was going on, but it was fun to sit next to her and think, \u201cThat\u2019s us on there!\u201d I also made a speech at the Cats Protection awards ceremony in her honour \u2013 another thing I never thought I\u2019d do. I told the audience it was heartwarming to know that more senior cats aren\u2019t being overlooked, and have nice retirement homes to go to. There are, of course, challenges to having an ageing cat; not only is she deaf, but she is also partially sighted. Yet she\u2019s been so easy to look after. The biggest difficulty is dealing with the fact that there may soon come a time when she passes. I\u2019m in denial about that. I look at her and just think she doesn\u2019t look old at all. Yet who knows? She could well be on the way to becoming the oldest cat in history. Though even if she doesn\u2019t break the current record of 38 years and three days, at least I\u2019ll know she had a great retirement home. \u2022 As told to Diyora Shadijanova Do you have an experience to share?

        "body": "\u2018Next year I want to focus on reading that is fun\u2019 Sathnam Sanghera I\u2019ve written three books on the British empire, so have basically just been reading history for about five years. Last year the best was, without doubt, Matthew Parker\u2019s One Fine Day. It was such a great idea to tell this complex history through the prism of one day in 1923, when the British empire hit its peak. Doing so meant he was immediately freed from the inane \u201cbalance sheet\u201d view that has British historians forever listing the positives and negatives of the enterprise. What emerges instead is a nuanced and readable book. But reading so much history I sometimes forget that I\u2019ve also written a novel, and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ve lost my tendency to think and write creatively. So next year I want to focus on stuff that is fun; books that aren\u2019t about the British empire, genocide or colonisation. I want to focus on human stories that entertain me and amuse me, and maybe get some light in my life. The first one is The Bee Sting by Paul Murray. It\u2019s a comic novel set in Ireland. Everyone\u2019s going on about it, and I feel like I\u2019m missing out. I also want to read You Are Here by David Nicholls, out in spring. I think he\u2019s the funniest writer around and incredibly insightful about people. I would also like to try Charles Dickens. I\u2019ve never read him properly; I took against him at university. The times I\u2019ve picked him up I\u2019ve found him prolix and hard to get into. The closest I\u2019ve got is watching The Muppet Christmas Carol, which is very good, but it didn\u2019t make me want to read the book. However, last year, Nick Hornby\u2019s Dickens and Prince: A Particular Kind of Genius really opened my eyes because I\u2019m a massive Prince fan, and it made me rethink Dickens \u2013 maybe I was being ignorant in not reading him. So I\u2019m either going to read Great Expectations or A Tale of Two Cities. I\u2019m slightly put off by the latter because I saw an adaptation of it, which was a four-hour monstrosity set outdoors \u2013 it made me want to die. I think I\u2019ll go for Great Expectations, it seems accessible. Another on my reading list for later in 2024 is Welcome to Glorious Tuga by Francesca Segal. It\u2019s about a woman who tries to escape her life in London by going to study tortoises on a faraway island. So it taps into that fantasy, that desire to escape that I think we\u2019ve all had since Covid. As told to Ella Creamer. Empireworld: How British Imperialism Has Shaped the Globe by Sathnam Sanghera will be published on 25 January \u2018I want to read remarkable stories of ancient lands\u2019 Elif Shafak I am preparing an eclectic reading list guided by the flow of rivers. This year I have been working on my new novel There Are Rivers in the Sky. Writing about rivers and floods, immersing myself in the mysteries of water, made me appreciate how connected we all are across borders. Mexico\u2019s famous R\u00edo Secreto and many underground rivers remind me that I need to read more Mexican authors, especially Valeria Luiselli, Laura Esquivel, Fernando del Paso, Yuri Herrera and the Mexican-American writer Sandra Cisneros. South Korea fascinates me in so many ways. The restoration of the River Cheonggyecheon, a great example of daylighting \u2013 the practice of uncovering a buried waterway \u2013 has inspired me to learn more about Korean literature and culture, and so I will be reading Kyung-sook Shin, Bae Suah and more of Han Kang. Buried Saharan rivers, ancestors\u2019 tracks, now mostly dried up or forgotten, will guide me towards the remarkable stories of other ancient lands. I want to learn more from the literatures of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia and Sudan. Bensalem Himmich, Laila Lalami, Le\u00efla Slimani, Tahar ben Jelloun. Also, Yasmina Khadra, Leila Aboulela, Ahdaf Soueif, Alaa al-Aswany, Muhammad Aladdin, Rania Mamoun, Jamal Mahjoub, Hisham Matar and the Sudanese-born writer Nesrine Malik. I will also be rereading Assia Djebar and Albert Camus this year, as I feel like their remarkable intelligence sheds light on our troubled times. The slow death of Zimbabwean rivers, just like the painful demise of the Tigris and the Euphrates, makes me more eager to read authors from or around the region. I will especially focus on Tsitsi Dangarembga, NoViolet Bulawayo, Petina Gappah and Alexandra Fuller. It is a large and heterogeneous collection, a diverse reading list that grows by the week, guided by the flow of rivers \u2013 those that are still with us and those that we have lost. There Are Rivers in the Sky by Elif Shafak will be published by Viking in August \u2018My list includes books about WG Sebald, Jean Rhys and James Baldwin\u2019 Sarah Waters I\u2019ve always loved reading about authors\u2019 lives, in the form of biographies, diaries and memoirs. But I\u2019ve rather dropped the habit, and plan to rekindle it in 2024. Luckily, there are some terrific looking books to get me back in the groove. First on my list is Carole Angier\u2019s biography of WG Sebald, Speak, Silence. I find Sebald\u2019s books mesmerising, with their brooding meditation on memory, exile and trauma, and their disconcerting blurring of the lines between fact and fiction. His life seems to have been similarly enigmatic, and, by all accounts, Angier has done a remarkable job of delving through layers of reticence and obfuscation to get to the troubled essence of the man and his work. Next, another rather slippery character, in the form of TS Eliot. One of my best reads last year was Erica Wagner\u2019s Mary and Mr Eliot, which explores the fascinating relationship between Eliot and his close friend Mary Trevelyan \u2013 and incidentally exposes what a self-centred bastard he was. So I\u2019m looking forward to Lyndall Gordon\u2019s The Hyacinth Girl, a study of another of the remarkable women in Eliot\u2019s life, his American muse and confidante, Emily Hale. Then there\u2019s Miranda Seymour\u2019s I Used to Live Here Once, a new biography of Jean Rhys. I\u2019m familiar with some of the details of Rhys\u2019s extraordinary, rackety life, which featured periods of exile, heartbreak, alcoholism and literary obscurity. But I know hardly anything about her Caribbean childhood, and nothing about the writing process that produced masterpieces like Wide Sargasso Sea and Good Morning, Midnight. So I\u2019m excited by the prospect of reading Seymour\u2019s book, which promises to supply all that and much more. An almost exact contemporary of Rhys\u2019s was the novelist and journalist Storm Jameson, and I\u2019m delighted to see that Pushkin will soon be reprinting her 1969 autobiography, Journey from the North. Born in Whitby, Yorkshire, in 1891, Jameson wrote more than 50 books, was active in socialist and pacifist politics, and worked prominently for English PEN, helping refugee writers and their families escape from Nazi-occupied Europe. She was a sensitive, forthright, hugely likable writer, and, as with many 20th-century female authors, deserves to be more widely known. And, finally, another author whose life and career intertwined with political upheavals and radical social change: James Baldwin. Baldwin was a brilliant chronicler of African American life, and his essays are among some of the finest ever written, with a trenchant understanding of the complicated intersections of race, class and sexuality. Giovanni\u2019s Room, his groundbreaking novel from 1956, is a beautiful, blistering depiction of gay male desire. I\u2019d love to know more about his influences, his early years and his civil rights activism \u2013 so will turn with great pleasure to a new biography by Bill V Mullen, James Baldwin: Living in Fire. Sarah Waters\u2019 novels include Fingersmith and most recently The Paying Guests, published by Virago \u2018I\u2019m turning to sci-fi and dystopia\u2019 Sheena Patel I have a fascination with sci-fi that is purely theoretical. I often think about reading it but never make any attempt to go near such books because I am afraid of the imagination I will find there. Perhaps I haven\u2019t felt I can really access the genre because sci-fi feels like what Black and Brown people can go through on a daily basis. We\u2019re still in an age of empire, even though we are distracted from this knowledge. I do love sci-fi films though. I had a true epiphany when I saw Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Under the Skin at the cinema. It was so strange, the alien mixed with the mundane, documentary spliced with fantastical set pieces. Next year I think I will read the Michel Faber book from which the movie was adapted. In 2024 I also want to tackle Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune books. Earlier this year, I watched the film on my laptop maybe 50 times. At first, I hated it, but then I totally fell in love with it \u2013 the visual representation of different worlds opened my mind. Throat singing and nomadic desert tribes could be used as a mood board for the future, but this is already happening now in communities that are regarded as \u201cprimitive\u201d. It is the future because it is eternal \u2013 such a beautiful thought. We are fed so much dystopia that reading it in fiction feels hard \u2013 but, as the world burns, maybe it is a good idea to hear from artists about where we might be heading. So the other three titles I will try are classics: Octavia E Butler\u2019s Kindred, Stanis\u0142aw Lem\u2019s Solaris and The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin. The present feels so bleak, and our vision of the future so foreshortened, it almost seems like tempting fate \u2013 but, without science fiction, how can we dream? I\u2019m a Fan by Sheena Patel is published in paperback by Granta \u2018I\u2019d like to tackle more fiction in translation\u2019 Benjamin Myers Winter is the best time for fiction, a season in which I am drawn to all things old, or weird, so 2023 started with a series of big names that I\u2019d previously avoided: The Sea, the Sea by Iris Murdoch, which pulled me in and spat me out; the deep dive into time and place of Waterland by Graham Swift; and the perfectly succinct Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. The Ice Palace by Tarjei Vesaas reminded me that certain Scandinavian literature speaks to me in ways I can\u2019t fully articulate. Perhaps it is the Viking blood that a recent DNA test revealed I have within me. The Birds by Vesaas achieved an astonishing trick with a narrative voice that almost made me want to give up writing entirely. Almost. I also found comfort in retreating back into a 20th-century England of fried breakfasts, furtive sexual encounters and infrequent bathing via The Bloater by Rosemary Tonks, The Glass Pearls by Emeric Pressburger, The Children of Dynmouth by William Trevor and The Slaves of Solitude by Patrick Hamilton. A new discovery was Love, Leda by Mark Hyatt, a bisexual, occasionally homeless and often brilliant poet, who died by his own hand in a cave near Blackburn in Lancashire. I slumped in the summer, but, with winter here again, the fire is lit and the fiction tower is wobbling. I\u2019d like to tackle more literature in translation. I\u2019ve yet to read Olga Tokarczuk or Lucas Rijneveld, and have an entire Halld\u00f3r Laxness backlist winking at me. I often remember a Richard Brautigan character who is reading \u201cthe Russians\u201d and think I really should do the same. But then, resolutions are for breaking, and with Ireland seemingly producing an amazing new novel every fortnight, The Heart in Winter by Kevin Barry or Wild Houses by Colin Barrett will, I suspect, provide pure reading pleasure as we ease into spring. Two other novels have been patiently waiting for me to pick them up for several years now: Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry and Beyond Black by Hilary Mantel. Perhaps the time has come. Cuddy by Benjamin Myers won the 2023 Goldsmiths prize and is out in paperback by Bloomsbury on 1 February \u2018I\u2019ll try to meet up with the Latin poets I studied\u2019 Sebastian Barry My degree was in ancient and modern literature. Next year I might try to start again into the lovely thickets of Virgil\u2019s Aeneid, if I can drum up the courage and strength. I did a degree called ancient and modern literature, and the ancient part of it was Latin. Although I was the worst, or at least the slowest, reader of Virgil in the history of students struggling with spondees and dactyls, I still believe it did me infinite good, as whatever sort of writer I ended up, to make the attempt. I am sure many people who have been through university have that curious bookshelf in their later houses that are the texts \u2013 never reread, gathering the dust of decades \u2013 from those old campaigns to survive their degrees. I certainly do. All those red-jacketed Loeb classics, even a few green ones denoting Greek, which I never penetrated. I have a lovely, genius friend called Daniel Mendelsohn, a famous classicist, who told me recently he was going again through the rabbinical texts for the love of it. Well! I think he told me that when he first looked into Greek, another of his acquisitions, as a child, he could more or less intuit the shape and the sense of it, knew the essence and atmosphere of it instinctively. I possess no such assistance from a sluggish brain. But I thought next year I might try to meet up with Propertius again, and perpetually modern Catullus (who died so young), and Horace of the Satires rather than the Odes, although I am probably old enough for the Odes now, God knows. And Plautus, and maybe Terence, who didn\u2019t teach me much about playwriting, maybe, but did indicate that demotic writing existed 2,000 years before television. Old God\u2019s Time by Sebastian Barry will be published in paperback by Faber on 1 February \u2018I\u2019m craving the immersive experience that a long book provides\u2019 Cecile Pin I keep tab of my reading on my Notes app. This past year has been a bit eclectic: I read eight books in August, and only one the next month. I favoured fiction, with quite a few Greek myths, classics or retellings in the first half of the year, and debuts throughout. I especially loved Fire Rush by Jacqueline Crooks and Nothing Special by Nicole Flattery. There was also some poetry (Louise Gl\u00fcck and Anne Carson), and a few science books, mostly research for my next novel. One detail stands out: almost all the books I\u2019ve read sit under 300 pages, and I know that\u2019s not by chance. Perhaps for fear of commitment, or a shortened attention span in the age of social media, I tend to avoid reading long books. Often, when looking for my next read in bookshops, my eyes avoid the bulky tomes \u2013 and I (shamefully) look at the page count before reading the blurb. I\u2019d like to remedy this in 2024. I\u2019m craving the immersive experience that a long read often provides, with a meticulous sense of place and time, and sweeping character arc. More than this, there is a discipline that comes with reading longer works: you must be more consistent, reading a little each day instead of 300 pages one day and zero for two weeks. I\u2019d like to apply that discipline to other aspects of my life, particularly my writing, which, like my reading, tends to come in fits and starts. I\u2019ll probably start with Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver, which I\u2019ve heard only good things about. I also have in mind Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, which I\u2019ve been meaning to read for years, In Ascension by Martin MacInnes, and The Love Songs of WEB Du Bois by Honor\u00e9e Fanonne Jeffers. On the nonfiction side, I\u2019m currently reading American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, and would like to read Eve by Cat Bohannon. Wandering Souls by Cecile Pin is out in paperback, published by 4th Estate \u2018I\u2019m drawn to nonfiction about climate change and motherhood\u2019 Alice Winn Lately, I\u2019ve been finding myself drawn to nonfiction, possibly because, with novels, I\u2019ve seen how the sausage is made, so nonfiction feels like an escape. I have a theory that I am more psychologically equipped to think about climate change when it\u2019s cold outside, so am aiming to read The Climate Book edited by Greta Thunberg early in the year. It\u2019s a collection of essays by more than 100 experts, so I figure if one essay depresses me, the next might have a more cheerful outlook. Aubrey Gordon is a co-host on the podcast Maintenance Phase, about anti-fat bias and the food system generally. I love the podcast because she and Michael Hobbes are funny and personable, but I also really feel they have improved my media literacy. So I\u2019m looking forward to reading Gordon\u2019s new book, You Just Need to Lose Weight: And 19 Other Myths About Fat People, which I assume will be charming and informative. Liana Finck is my favourite New Yorker cartoonist, and she had a baby not long before I did. Her cartoons cheered me up, especially because I found them on Instagram, buried among sponsored posts about how my child would grow up to be a serial killer if she didn\u2019t get enough tummy time. Her new book How to Baby: A No-Advice-Given Guide to Motherhood promises to be a mixture of funny essays, lists (\u201cNesting. The Comprehensive List of What to Buy and Why Getting Things Used Is Dangerous and Unamerican\u201d) and observations about motherhood. I want it! While nursing my daughter I got into the crusades and read Steven Runciman\u2019s excellent history in three volumes. Baldwin the Leper King! Saladin! Wily Frankish queens! So I\u2019m really looking forward to reading The Crusades Through Arab Eyes by Amin Maalouf (1984), which draws on primary sources to tell the story from an Arab perspective. \u2022 In Memoriam by Alice Winn is published by Viking",

        "body": "I like to make my own tea out of foraged, preserved or saved ingredients from the garden, spice rack and fruit bowl, be that dandelion, goosegrass and rosemary from outside, fruit skins and peelings, and spices such as cinnamon, cardamom and ginger. The peelings can be used fresh or dried. Steep orange skin straight after peeling, for example, to make an aromatic cup of tea \u2013 or, if you don\u2019t want to make it straight away, or if you have an excess of peelings, preserve them by drying them on a plate or rack in a warm part of the kitchen, or in the oven while it\u2019s cooling down after use. Once dried, they can be stored in a jar for up to a year. Leftover fruit skin herbal tea Herbal teas are costly to buy in teabag form, but they are incredibly simple to make from loose tea and ingredients from your garden, larder and fruit bowl. Fruit peelings are full of essential oils and aromatics, so are perfect for making your own tea; the quality and intensity of flavour will also be far superior. Try creating your own flavour combinations inspired by commercial herbal teas: turmeric gold, for example, can be made by mixing turmeric skins with green tea, while I make my own \u201clove\u201d tea with chamomile, lime peelings and dried or fresh edible flowers (marigold, lavender or rose, say). To make relaxing tea, mix fennel seeds with chamomile, orange peel, lemon balm and cardamom seeds. I\u2019m quite happy to have all the different ingredients floating around in the cup, but strain the tea first, if you prefer. Per serve 3-6 fruit peelings, dried or fresh (apple, orange, pomegranate), preferably organic \u00bc tsp dried herbs, or 1 sprig fresh (rosemary, sage, thyme; optional) 1 pinch spice (cinnamon, clove, vanilla), optional, to taste Depending on how strong you want the tea, and how many you\u2019re serving, put the fruit peelings in a mug, cafetiere or saucepan and cover with a cupful of boiling water per person. A quick steep in a cup or cafetiere will yield a mild flavour and might need the addition of more flavours, whereas a quick boil in a saucepan will create a stronger, more intense drink. If you like, add the dried or fresh herbs, and follow with an optional pinch of spice to taste. Leave to steep in a cup of cafetiere for five minutes, or bring up to a simmer in a saucepan, cook for three minutes, then turn off the heat and steep for five minutes. Your fruit tea is now ready to enjoy.",

        "body": "At the end of a quiet cul-de-sac 10 minutes drive from Manchestercity centre is a house with a white front door. Inside it live five female refugees from Eritrea. The neat, terrace property, they say, has provided them with a lifeline. Two of the women, Mariam and Helen (not their real names) said before arriving here they had spent short periods homeless and on the streets after the Home Office granted them refugee status. \u201cI don\u2019t have words to describe how I feel to be able to live in this house,\u201d said Mariam. \u201cI know a lot of people suffering with homelessness and it is particularly difficult and dangerous for women to have to sleep on the streets. This house is the best place. It is quiet and secure and nobody can disturb us here.\u201d Their home is spotlessly clean and freshly decorated with a spacious communal lounge and a large kitchen with smart grey units and ample cooking and storage facilities. There is a decent-sized back garden with a table and chairs where the women will be able to enjoy the outdoors when the weather improves. They have a cleaning rota to ensure everyone does their share to keep the house pristine. It is one of 19 properties managed by the charity Boaz Trust, a member of one of the Guardian and Observer 2023 charity appeal partners Naccom. The lion\u2019s share of Naccom\u2019s share of appeal donations will be regranted to member organisations working on the frontline of refugee homelessness. Boaz provides accommodation to a mix of refugees and refused asylum seekers who have no recourse to public funds. Rents in line with the local housing allowance are charged to refugees who have the right to work and access benefits and these payments subsidise the places for people. The trust provides wraparound support to those it accommodates to help them get on their feet as quickly as possible. This includes everything from employment and benefits advice, registering with a GP and obtaining a travel document to finding a new immigration lawyer to prepare a fresh asylum claim for those whose claims have been refused. The house the Eritrean women share is a stark contrast from both the type of accommodation often provided to asylum seekers by the Home Office. Unlike Home Office-procured accommodation, which uses a network of private companies, Boaz is not about making big profits. Shared housing provided by Home Office contractors is in many cases of poor quality. Horror stories about damp, mould, collapsed ceilings and infestations of vermin are not uncommon. Use of hotels, along with mass accommodation sites such as Wethersfield airfield in Essex and the Bibby Stockholm barge moored in Portland, Dorset, has attracted criticism from asylum seekers and human rights campaigners and has been the subject of various legal challenges. Sara Nathan, the co-founder of Refugees At Home, another of the charity appeal\u2019s 2023 partners, said the problems with Home Office provision of accommodation for asylum seekers were fixable: \u201cIf the Home Office made decisions quicker, there would be so much less demand for asylum seekers to be housed at all, let alone expensively in hotels. She urged the Home Office to provide homes that are \u201cdignified and appropriate\u201d. She said: \u201cIf asylum seekers could work and pay their own way, some would not need accommodation, and for others the transition into refugee life when they get leave to remain would be smoother and more productive.\u201d Jon Featonby, the chief policy analyst at the Refugee Council, a third Guardian and Observer appeal partner, said: \u201cPoor accommodation is a significant problem for those in the asylum system. What we have seen is a government that is all too willing to create more hardship for refugees, stripping away housing protections and introducing policies that negatively impact their health and wellbeing. It\u2019s shameful to see people seeking safety treated this way in a country that has long upheld values of fairness and compassion.\u201d Ros Holland, the chief executive of the Boaz Trust, said there was no single solution to fixing the problems with asylum seeker and refugee housing, and that a range of options were needed. But with a combination of decent housing and wraparound support, which is bespoke for each individual, rapid progress can be made. \u201cWe see people transformed when they have a place to stay and a space to recover in,\u201d she said. Mariam moved into the Manchester house in August. Her English has improved and she has a driving test booked in the hope that it will allow her to get a job as a care worker looking after people in their own homes. \u201cNow that I\u2019m a refugee and I have somewhere to live I want to help other people. If I pass my driving test I hope I can get a job in home care, helping elderly and disabled people,\u201d she said.",

I remember getting really excited about it snowing outside and my dad sat me on the bed and told me the story of a boy at his school who was blinded by a snowball. I was traumatised by that, and other endless horror stories. My dad also had a massive ego. He was in this mod band called Relay. Instead of reading us bedtime stories he\u2019d bring his guitar in and talk about the band. He once told us he wrote the song Tambourine Man. For years, whenever I heard it on the radio, I\u2019d think: my fucking dad wrote this. I eventually challenged him on it. He said, \u201cI never said I wrote that,\u201d but he fucking well did. Our upbringing was unconventional, but we just thought it was the norm. I once shared a mattress with my brother, Charlie. We\u2019d been evicted from the home my parents were renting. They\u2019d not paid their rent for five months; we ended up in a tiny two-bedroom council house, where my parents still live. We were actually in our 20s at the time. What happened if one of us pulled? That never happened. My experience of Rada was traumatic. The tutors practised the Stanislavski Method. Us students were made to talk about our experiences of rape and miscarriage in order to be as \u201creal\u201d as possible. It was bollocks. Acting is just pretending. You can either do it or you can\u2019t. This Country changed everything. My whole sense of self-worth shifted. I was validated. People were like, \u201cYeah, yeah, they\u2019re going to write something, of course they are.\u201d But we did. We had zero money before. I couldn\u2019t even afford tampons. Now I don\u2019t have to think about money. It\u2019s brilliant not to be on the hamster wheel of worry. How do I chill out? I masturbate. I love reading books. I really love ghost stories and walking around haunted places. I\u2019ve seen a ghost \u2013 it was underwhelming. Meeting Rami Malek at Jimmy Carr\u2019s party blew my mind. His girlfriend was a big This Country fan. Did he offer me a part in his next film? Did he fuck. I feel pressure to maintain success, but I\u2019m not as ambitious as I used to be. If this is my lot, I\u2019m happy with it. As long as I can keep doing my Cameo videos, that\u2019ll do me. Being famous is fucking brilliant. I can just ring up Pizza Express and get a table there on a busy Saturday. The next thing I want to do is write a film. That\u2019s what Simon Pegg did. I remember him saying, \u201cMoney wise, don\u2019t bother with TV series, the money is in movies.\u201d So I\u2019m going to give that a go. If that fails, I\u2019m going to start my own OnlyFans account; whatever is the least amount of effort. I\u2019d charge punters \u00a3100 for me to say, \u201cYou\u2019re a cockwomble\u201d to them. My ultimate ambition is to write the film script for Katie Price: The Movie. I\u2019d play Katie and I\u2019d make it win an Oscar and if I could get my tits done like hers on a production budget, then that would be the dream. I\u2019m sure people think I\u2019m a gobshite and a show-off. I\u2019d like to think that people think I\u2019m open and honest and that I just can\u2019t be anything other than me.

        "body": "It is roughly 58 years since Jodie Foster\u2019s first acting role and there are things she won\u2019t put up with on set. She won\u2019t be told how to get into character. She won\u2019t tolerate what she calls \u201cvoodoo\u201d directing, that is am-dram, shake-your-body-out nonsense. She won\u2019t respond to certain types of \u201calpha\u201d interference from people up the industry chain. (The only time Foster submits to bossy producers, she says, is when they are \u201csuper passive-aggressive British people\u201d \u2013 a type she just can\u2019t resist.) In work mode, and outside interactions with the press, she is conscientious, matter-of-fact, with almost no performance anxiety or self-consciousness. \u201cI approach a story or character in the same way I do a book report,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to make it pragmatic.\u201d We are in a hotel suite in West Hollywood where the 61-year-old is charming and pleasant, with gel-spiked hair, tiny-waisted black trousers and a crisp white shirt popped at the collar. She could be a matador, or someone in high-end catering, and the sheer familiarity of her face and manner is startling. The voice and smile, the teasing laugh and intensity, evoke decades of iconic roles, from Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs and Sarah Tobias in The Accused, back to her childhood roles in Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone. Foster kicks off her mules to reveal red painted toenails, and tucks her legs up under her, an unstudied gesture \u2013 or a knowing one. After five decades of fame, I imagine she understands as well as I do that, \u201cshe tucks her legs up under her\u201d is the type of dumb line profile writers like to use to summon fake intimacy. There is another side to Foster; one that is markedly less straightforward and, over the years, has made much of the coverage of her painful to read. She can be intensely self-conscious, a state if not wholly created then certainly intensified by the experience of having journalists test every conceivable angle to get the subject of her sexuality on the table. For a long time, Foster was the only visible gay woman in Hollywood and these days her ability to talk publicly about her life is mired in something that, to me, looks a lot like PTSD. Anyway, here we are, ostensibly to talk about True Detective: Night Country, the fourth season of the bro-y cult anthology show previously stewarded by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and that, this season, finally features some women. Foster plays Liz Danvers, chief of police of Ennis, a godforsaken small town in the far north of Alaska, where we join the story on the eve of permanent night: the two months of the year when that part of the world is in darkness. It\u2019s a police procedural, an odd-couple buddy drama, an affecting depiction of North American Indigenous life and, like the other True Detectives, a tale of the supernatural that doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense but still offers a highly enjoyable ride. Foster\u2019s cop, \u201cAlaska Karen\u201d as she puts it, is lonely and embittered, spitting out lines like: \u201cStop where you are, Ennis police \u2026 fucker.\u201d As roles go it\u2019s not a big stretch for Foster, who enjoyed shooting the six-parter in Iceland, but there is a satisfying arc for her character that is clearly her kind of thing. A more arresting feature of the show is considering what it must have been like for the relatively young cast and crew to work alongside Jodie Foster. Apart from Fiona Shaw, who plays a former university professor living on the edge of town and with whom Foster had no scenes (they dined together, she says), the production is made up of mostly new and inexperienced performers. Kali Reis, who is brilliant as Evangeline Navarro, Danvers\u2019 Indigenous sidekick, was until recently a professional boxer; Issa L\u00f3pez, the director, is a successful Mexican writer who has made a handful of Spanish-language movies, including the fantasy-horror film Tigers Are Not Afraid, but this is her first big project in the US. Foster, by contrast, has been in about 50 productions, directed multiple films and TV episodes, won two best actress Oscars, for The Silence of the Lambs and The Accused. Some singular quality in Foster that is hard to describe \u2013 a kind of flinching intensity, perhaps \u2013 along with the sheer volume and standard of her work, puts her close to being an icon. What on earth can it have been like for the young people working with her? She won\u2019t have this, of course. \u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty fun. I mean \u2013 I don\u2019t take anything seriously. I make jokes all the time.\u201d She pauses. \u201cAnd, you know, I\u2019m not an expert.\u201d This makes me laugh out loud. You are the definition of an expert. You\u2019ve been doing this job since you were three years old! Imagine De Niro or Pacino saying such a thing. Foster smiles. \u201cNot really. I just know me, I don\u2019t really know anybody else, and even as a director \u2013 I\u2019m not really an actor\u2019s director, interestingly.\u201d Foster\u2019s directorial debut, the 1991 movie Little Man Tate, in which she also starred, has been followed in her directing career by a handful of movies and individual episodes of TV shows such as Orange Is the New Black and Black Mirror. \u201cI really let the actors do their thing and just hope I\u2019ve cast correctly. I\u2019m not somebody who can tease a performance on take 200. I believe that you cast, and allow something to happen on screen, and, if you do it fast enough, people don\u2019t overthink themselves.\u201d She has very particular requirements when it comes to being directed herself, and if there was any difficulty on True Detective \u2013 \u201cWell, not difficult, but the little dance that has to be done\u201d \u2013 it was with the director, L\u00f3pez. \u201cShe has directed four movies, and I\u2019ve been in so many films, and I think that part is sometimes daunting. But we bonded immediately and laughed through everything. I like it when directors tell me what they want and say things like faster, slower. I\u2019m not interested in directors who are like\u201d \u2013 she puts on a whispery, luvvie-ish voice \u2013 \u201c\u2018Here, let me shake you!\u2019 She might have to do that with other people, because they\u2019re young or they\u2019ve never acted before. And I would watch her do that with them and \u2026 \u201d Foster snorts. \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that with me.\u201d This is the second consecutive project in which Foster has worked with much less experienced directors. On the recent Netflix movie Nyad, in which Foster plays Bonnie Stoll, the best friend and coach of marathon swimmer, Diana Nyad, she was working with an even less seasoned team: first-time feature directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, who had previously only worked in documentary film. I loved Nyad, partly because it was so funny and well written, partly because Annette Bening is brilliant in the title role, and partly because of Foster, who is more relaxed on screen than anything I\u2019ve seen her in since she made Freaky Friday at the age of 13. It is nice, for once, to see her playing someone who isn\u2019t slogging through a trauma or being launched alone into space. In Nyad, she is loose-limbed, and full of easy humour and jokes \u2013 her performance has just been nominated for a Golden Globe. As far as I\u2019m aware, it\u2019s the first time Foster has played an out lesbian. (There\u2019s a separate essay to be written about gay subtext in her depiction of Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs, which lesbians will give you chapter and verse on \u2013 the boots, the duffel coat, the way she shrinks and smirks in relation to the male characters, I could go on). The press around the film, particularly when hacks brought up the fact both lead characters were gay, was customarily awkward. It is worth pointing out here that it is harder for gay women than gay men in Hollywood, where there is no female equivalent of, say, showrunner Ryan Murphy (well, there is; but she\u2019s so far back in the closet she\u2019s practically in Narnia). I don\u2019t blame Foster for withdrawing. Questions about her life aren\u2019t overtly hostile or mocking these days, but there is often still a judgment behind them: from straight people, broadly, why are you still so bent out of shape by this; and from the gay press, why didn\u2019t you do more back in the day? I tell Foster I loved Nyad and she says, brightly: \u201cOh, thanks! I love those two [Bonnie and Diana], so that was the number one reason to do it. I knew them from barbecues and stuff.\u201d There is a trauma narrative in Nyad that is subtly handled. As a teen swim champion, Nyad was molested by her coach. \u201cObviously, they\u2019re young film-makers and there was a lot of \u2013 we all brought our thoughts to the table, having made movies about victims of sexual violence. They shot a lot more than they put in.\u201d Instead, the film focuses on Nyad\u2019s record-breaking swim from Cuba to Florida, undertaken at the age of 64 and in the face of immense physical risks. \u201cThe important thing to Diana and me and Annette was: we cannot think that she achieves the swim because of the molestation. My happiest moment in the film is when Bonnie says as an aside, \u2018Oh, I read in the paper that he [the coach] died.\u2019 And Diana says, \u2018He didn\u2019t mark me; it\u2019s just that sometimes, every once in a while, I feel like I\u2019m 14 again and fighting this stuff.\u2019\u201d Personally, I liked the hangout scenes at the start of the movie, when Foster and Bening are chilling at home in LA, playing table tennis and Scrabble. \u201cYeah. I love those scenes.\u201d To achieve Bonnie\u2019s washboard stomach, Foster worked out like an athlete for six months; she swans about the movie in cutoff shorts and a vest, brandishing her clipboard and whistle like the world\u2019s buffest PE teacher. She has always been portrayed as a nerd, but in light of the evidence isn\u2019t she really just as much of a jock? Foster laughs loudly. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to be objectified my entire life, so I\u2019m very happy that people have started talking about my body parts.\u201d Foster spoke recently about her 50s being a tricky decade of transition in which she had to figure out, in the absence of many role models, how to be a woman above a certain age in Hollywood. She found an answer in friendships both up and down the age range. \u201cI have a friend who I adore, who\u2019s 80. She\u2019s a college professor, she lived in a commune in the early 70s, she\u2019s an extraordinary person. I get to see what\u2019s ahead, what\u2019s possible. For all of her accomplishments, what she keeps saying, which I think is really true, is that the greatest thing is helping communities of other women.\u201d What does she think young people in her industry need to hear? \u201cThey need to learn how to relax, how to not think about it so much, how to come up with something that\u2019s theirs. I can help them find that, which is so much more fun than being, with all the pressure behind it, the protagonist of the story.\u201d I mention to Foster that I saw a photo of her recently with the young British actor, Bella Ramsey, the non-binary star of the HBO zombie hit The Last of Us and who, at 20 years old, is on the brink of megastardom. Last month, Ramsey introduced Foster at the Elle magazine Women in Hollywood celebration, a pairing Foster says she requested herself. \u201cI reached out to Bella, because we\u2019d never met, and said, \u2018I want you to introduce me at this thing\u2019, which is a wonderful event about actors and people in the movies, but is also very much a fashion thing. Which means it\u2019s determining who represents us. [The organisers] are very proud of themselves because they\u2019ve got every ethnicity, and I\u2019m like, yeah, but all the attendees are still wearing heels and eyelashes. There are other ways of being a woman, and it\u2019s really important for people to see that. And Bella, who gave the best speech, was wearing the most perfect suit, beautifully tailored, and a middle parting and no makeup.\u201d As a mentoring relationship, it\u2019s part of a pattern, says Foster. \u201cI do a lot of reaching out to young actresses. I\u2019m compelled. Because it was hard growing up.\u201d When she looks at Ramsey, who told British Vogue earlier this year that \u201cI\u2019m not 100% straight\u201d, does she feel a pang of sympathy for her younger self? \u201cYes.\u201d It was so bleak. \u201cBut I had my mom, you know.\u201d Foster\u2019s late mother, Brandy, was a force of nature in the entertainment industry, who raised her four children in LA and stewarded Foster, from the age of three, when she first put her up for commercials, to stardom. Could she have worn a suit and had a severe middle parting with no makeup when she was coming up as a young actor? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause we weren\u2019t free. Because we didn\u2019t have freedom. And hopefully that\u2019s what the vector of authenticity that\u2019s happening offers \u2013 the possibility of real freedom. We had other things that were good. And I would say: I did the best I could for my generation. I was very busy understanding where I fitted in and where I wanted to be in terms of feminism. But my lens wasn\u2019t wide enough. I lived in an incredibly segregated world.\u201d I mention something she said the other day about fear dictating most of our choices. \u201cIt can. It keeps you safe.\u201d But it\u2019s also warping, isn\u2019t it? Beyond a certain point? \u201cWell, it\u2019s a survival skill. But one that will kill you eventually.\u201d I should add that, for all her cheerleading of gen Z, Foster isn\u2019t above being irritated by them. \u201cThey\u2019re really annoying, especially in the workplace. They\u2019re like, \u2018Nah, I\u2019m not feeling it today, I\u2019m gonna come in at 10.30am.\u2019 Or, like, in emails, I\u2019ll tell them this is all grammatically incorrect, did you not check your spelling? And they\u2019re like, \u2018Why would I do that, isn\u2019t that kind of limiting?\u2019\u201d Foster has two sons, Kit and Charles, who are in their 20s and whom she had with her ex-partner, film producer Cydney Bernard. She and Bernard split up in 2008 and for the last 10 years she has been married to the photographer Alexandra Hedison. A funny effect of her sons\u2019 upbringing, says Foster, was their early confusion over how, precisely, to be male. \u201cMy two don\u2019t like sports,\u201d she says. \u201cThey like to watch movies and sit at home, and they\u2019re really into their female friends. They\u2019re super feminist. And there was a moment with my older one when he was in high school, when, because he was raised by two women \u2013 three women \u2013 it was like he was trying to figure out what it was to be a boy. And he watched television and came to the conclusion, oh, I just need to be an asshole. I understand! I need to be shitty to women, and act like I\u2019m a fucker. And I was like, no! That\u2019s not what it is to be a man! That\u2019s what our culture has been selling you for all this time.\u201d The phase went on for six months, she says. Did she let it play out? \u201cYes, and no. I was like, you won\u2019t be talking to me like that.\u201d Foster bursts into laughter. Meanwhile, her wife has just had a short documentary called Alok \u2013 a portrait of the non-binary author, poet and comedian Alok Vaid-Menon \u2013 accepted by Sundance, which Foster says makes her very proud. Although Foster served as the short film\u2019s executive producer, they are not overly involved in each other\u2019s work. \u201cWe like doing our work independently, although there are things that I do better, she recognises.\u201d Sounds ominous. Like what? \u201cI\u2019m a really good letter writer. And she\u2019s extraordinarily visual. Great photographer.\u201d Getting to this place of seeming security and happiness with Hedison has been a struggle for Foster. Even minor celebrity is corrosive, and Foster\u2019s fame is ridiculous. It has taken years of work, she says, not to be ruined by it. \u201cThere is a meta-weirdness to having been a public figure from the time you were young, right? Especially if you have stayed being an actor.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until she took time off mid-career that she realised just how odd her life was. Suddenly, \u201cI had lots of time where I wasn\u2019t the most important person in the room. Or not everybody was listening to the stupid shit I was ranting about. Being a public figure, your universe is altered and you just don\u2019t know anything else. And you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re a blowhard, and that you\u2019re not a good friend, and that you never show up.\u201d Because people indulge you? \u201cBecause people indulge you. So there are hard lessons you have to learn. There\u2019s something Hugh Grant said, which I thought was right on: that the fame thing at a young age is like being shot up with steroids and you live with those big muscles your whole life, and then, one day, you make the decision that there are no more steroids. And you don\u2019t recognise yourself and have no idea who you are. And you have to rebuild an entire identity. That can be difficult, and that\u2019s something I had to learn late.\u201d During the years Foster was with Bernard, she never took her to the Oscars or other public events, and never publicly owned to their relationship \u2013 although she did, later, pay tribute to her in her 2013 Golden Globes speech, when after thanking Bernard she said, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of our modern family.\u201d What\u2019s the reckoning, I ask. Is it someone telling you they can\u2019t live with you any more because you\u2019re so awful? \u201cYes. Definitely. An actor\u2019s life is not a good life to be self-aware. It\u2019s very easy to be un-self-aware.\u201d Presumably the magnetic pull back towards being an arsehole is strong, although, says Foster, she has strategies in place. \u201cI think, healthily, I created compartments around things. But the compartments are problematic for my relationships.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to know me in this context.\u201d She indicates the surroundings of the interview. \u201cThis is just mine. My friends don\u2019t know it, my kids didn\u2019t know what I did for a living till quite late. They had no idea. I never brought them on set.\u201d That\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it? \u201cI guess it\u2019s good? But then there\u2019s other actors whose kids are like, \u2018Oh, I lived in Romania [when my parent was filming] and I did this and that \u2026 \u2019 and I didn\u2019t do any of that with my kids. Maybe they would\u2019ve had adventures, or something.\u201d The point is, she says, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing normal about being a public figure from the time when you were young, and there\u2019s a lot of negotiating around that \u2013 to figure out how to be a whole person\u201d. It can\u2019t have been easy for her and yet she still gets a lot of stick for decisions she has made over the years. \u201cAnd I will never be able to explain,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause unless you were there, you don\u2019t get it. There are choices that I made that people can say, \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 Well, you didn\u2019t walk in my shoes. Try to walk in my shoes and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d * * * I have one quick question about The Silence of the Lambs. One thing about Foster\u2019s acting is that, because of the intelligence she brings to her roles, she very rarely caves in to cliche. When she won the best actress Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992, it was for a role that felt like nothing we had seen on screen before. The chemistry between Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Foster as the trainee FBI agent made the movie, but, of the two of them, it was Foster\u2019s film. There\u2019s a scene at the end where Clarice is groping her way through the killer\u2019s house in the pitch dark, and he\u2019s watching her through night-vision goggles. And her hand, holding the gun out in front of her, is shaking with nerves. It runs against every boilerplate depiction of the hard-charging FBI agent. She is quivering with fear, and my question is: was that detail Foster\u2019s or director Jonathan Demme\u2019s idea? \u201cIt was my idea.\u201d Knew it! \u201cThat felt right to me. There was something unexpected about Clarice \u2013 that she was able to have power, but was so vulnerable and had that smallness. She recognised that she wasn\u2019t powerful physically, and it didn\u2019t occur to me that there was anything revolutionary about that. You\u2019re playing somebody who could be what we see as a male character \u2013 the action guy. But she\u2019s not; she\u2019s Clarice.\u201d Foster could be describing herself. The contrast between smallness and power is somehow central to her appeal and is also present in her ability to enforce boundaries off-screen. \u201cI\u2019m not a multitasker. I\u2019m a weird focused person. If there\u2019s a spectrum, that\u2019s my spectrum. It doesn\u2019t matter if there are planes going by or if someone is calling my name, if I\u2019m focused on something. I\u2019m really good at going, no thank you, I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d No kidding. She won\u2019t be moved and she won\u2019t be put upon, and, at this point in her life, she won\u2019t be made to feel bad about any of it, either. \u201cYou can get a skin as an actor, not just for being criticised, but [told what to do]: \u2018Can you move your body there? Can you do this, can you be emotional here?\u2019 I learned how to do all that. And I will not.\u201d For decades, Foster was chastised in public for doing it wrong and lectured on how she should be doing it instead. \u201cAnd now,\u201d she says, looking at me rather pointedly, \u201cI\u2019m like, I\u2019ll do it for my job, and I\u2019m not going to do it for you.\u201d \u2022 True Detective: Night Country is available on Sky Atlantic and Now from 15 January.",

If you want to read more about it you can Google it. Now, Coady is back at Rococo (hurrah for karma!) and has launched the most expensive chocolates, gram for gram, in Great Britain. I\u2019m not usually a fan of expensive chocolates per se, but these are \u00a33.50 a truffle so, while small, it is possible to sample them for a not huge outlay. The Cru Criollo truffles are being launched to celebrate Rococo\u2019s ruby anniversary. Criollo is the rarest of beans, making up just 0.01% of cocoa in the world, and the truffles come in three permutations, from a dark milk at 38% to a 75%. It\u2019s hard to fault them. They are delicious. Very probably perfect. And if you forgot someone over Christmas, a box of these at \u00a333 for nine, presuming they like chocolate of course, will make you popular again. Another set of really good truffles were the single-origin ganache ones by Coco Chemistry. I wasn\u2019t expecting much, as I find cream truffles (which these are) very hit and miss. Either the shell is so thick to contain the ganache that you have to practically unhinge your jaw or they just hope that using the word ganache on a label makes up for all manner of ills. But these were memorable. Now for the bad news: they are only available as part of the subscription club, from \u00a360 for three months. Other truffles are available from Coco Chemistry at \u00a36.95, but I\u2019ve not tried them yet. Follow Annalisa on X @AnnalisaB",

        "body": "Two years ago, the Golden Globes and their organising body, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), were persona non grata in Hollywood. In disgrace following widespread reporting of corruption, racism and even sexual assault within their ranks, the ceremony was boycotted by the industry and dropped by its longtime broadcasting partner NBC. The awards went ahead, unattended and untelevised, posing an equivalent showbiz question to the old \u201cif a tree falls in a forest\u201d conundrum. Turns out they did make something of a sound: cue the awkward social-media spectacle of winners such as Nicole Kidman and Rachel Zegler advertising their victories while sternly admonishing the voters. In the frenetic, dog-eat-dog rush of awards season, even a tarnished win is an opportunity. After all, it\u2019s not as if the globes fell from a very high pedestal. For years, the small-time, even obscure nature of the HFPA membership \u2013 and its often questionable decisions, including an infamous win for Pia Zadora in the 80s amid allegations of bribery, or a best picture nomination for the Johnny Depp calamity The Tourist \u2013 was a point of mockery from industry folk, who were still all too happy to attend their boozy January shindig. In the current climate of social consciousness, however, it became harder to look the other way from less trivial allegations \u2013 including actor Brendan Fraser\u2019s claim that former HFPA president Philip Berk groped him at an industry event. Pundits speculated that it was finally the end of the road for a tacky but once-treasured Hollywood institution. Yet what a difference a painstaking PR makeover makes. After a tentative return to television last year \u2013 still boycotted by some nominees, including Fraser \u2013 the globes this year are splashily declaring themselves not just back but entirely different: new voters, a new attitude, even a couple of new award categories. Hollywood, meanwhile, will be returning in all its most glittery finery, proving that you can\u2019t keep a good back-patting ceremony down. Or even a dubious one. There\u2019s a completely new voter base One thing everyone used to know about the Golden Globes is that they were run by the HFPA. Quite what, or who, that meant was a murkier question. Essentially a nonprofit organisation of entertainment journalists for non-US outlets, it was a small club (about 100 members at its largest, and thus a far easier group to sway than the 10,500-member academy that votes on the Oscars) but not a lofty one. Their seamy reputation was tolerated until 2021, when an LA Times investigation into the HFPA\u2019s ethics and demographic makeup turned up, among other scandals, a complete lack of black members. Now disbanded, the association has been replaced with an invited group of 300 international journalists: 47% female and only 40% white, as boasted by the Globes\u2019 new owners, private equity firm Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions. This year\u2019s mostly respectable nominations \u2013 topped by summer siblings Barbie and Oppenheimer, but heavy on critically adored art films such as Past Lives, Anatomy of a Fall and The Zone of Interest \u2013 suggest the new group would rather not be sneered at. Barbie is the one to beat\u2026 maybe Barbie leads all contenders at this year\u2019s Golden Globe awards with a whopping nine nominations \u2013 tied with the 1972 musical Cabaret for the second-most of all time, with only another 70s classic, Nashville, ahead of them on 11. Cynics might point out that three of Barbie\u2019s nominations are in the relatively minor best original song category, while another comes in the newly created and oddly defined category of cinematic and box office achievement, alongside the less prestigious likes of The Super Mario Bros Movie and Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. (When the Oscars floated a similar-sounding best popular film award a few years ago, it was ultimately scrapped for being craven and confusing \u2013 two adjectives the globes have never feared.) Don\u2019t assume Barbie\u2019s nomination haul guarantees a good night for Team Gerwig, however, particularly with fierce competition from Poor Things in the comedy/musical categories: from its record-breaking 11 bids, Nashville won a single award\u2026 for best original song. Don\u2019t place your Oscar bets just yet Then again, for those with an eye on the biggest prize \u2013 the Oscar \u2013 the globes aren\u2019t the be-all and end-all. For years, it was assumed that the globes were a reliable Oscar predictor but recently they\u2019ve diverged significantly, as pundits look more to industry guild awards and the Baftas for Oscar tea leaves. In the last 20 years, only eight best picture Oscar winners won the corresponding prize at the globes. Last year, globe voters preferred Martin McDonagh\u2019s The Banshees of Inisherin to eventual Oscar sweeper Everything Everywhere All at Once, just as they did Austin Butler and Angela Bassett to Oscar winners Brendan Fraser and Jamie Lee Curtis. The year before, Jane Campion\u2019s queer western The Power of the Dog trumped cheesy Oscar champ Coda; in others, they opted for The Social Network over The King\u2019s Speech, The Grand Budapest Hotel over Birdman, Brokeback Mountain over shock Oscar victor Crash, and so on. They can be hipper than you think If, like many critics and cinephiles, you think those choices reflect rather well on the beleaguered, less prestigious ceremony, here\u2019s the thing nobody tends to admit about the globes: they sometimes have better, bolder taste than you might think. This is the group, after all, that nominated David Lynch\u2019s visionary Mulholland Drive for best picture in 2001 \u2013 something the Oscars cannot claim \u2013 and has recently handed out inspired acting wins to the likes of Isabelle Huppert, for her daringly perverse portrayal of a conflicted rape victim in Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Elle, and Sally Hawkins, who wasn\u2019t even Oscar- or Bafta-nominated, for her highly original comic turn in Mike Leigh\u2019s Happy-Go-Lucky. Indeed, the globes\u2019 comedy/musical category has enabled them to reward various classic films and performances for which the Academy was too po-faced: Marilyn Monroe may never have received an Oscar nomination, but she did pick up a well-deserved Globe for Some Like It Hot. They have a serious thing for Barbra Streisand For all their past diversity-related controversies, the globes beat the Oscars to one particular milestone by 26 years. Whereas it took the latter until 2010 to reward a woman for best director \u2013 Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker \u2013 the globes did it all the way back in 1984. Admittedly, the HFPA didn\u2019t have to move outside their celebrity-loving comfort zone to do this: the winner was Barbra Streisand for her directorial debut, the self-aggrandising musical Yentl, an achievement the academy\u2019s directors\u2019 branch chose not to nominate at all. As it happens, between her achievements in acting, filmmaking and songwriting, La Streisand holds the record for the most Golden Globe trophies with 10. (Meryl Streep, with eight, holds the record for acting wins alone.) With globe voters having preferred James Cameron to Bigelow in the year of her Oscar coronation, only Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and Jane Campion have since joined Streisand on the list of women to win for directing: Greta Gerwig and Past Lives newcomer Celine Song are hoping to join them this year. They didn\u2019t have a host until 2010 Traditionally, the appeal of the globes has been that it\u2019s the more fun, more raucous version of the Oscars. With seating around dinner tables rather than theatre-style, and alcohol flowing freely throughout, it has a reputation for entertainingly inebriated speeches and chaotic mishaps \u2013 the night where a hammered Elizabeth Taylor couldn\u2019t open the envelope for the award she was presenting, and when Ren\u00e9e Zellweger was in the loo when her best actress win was announced. A frill-free ceremony \u2013 just awards, no production numbers, no emcee \u2013 was a key part of their informality. Then, in 2010, they introduced a tradition of suitably fast-and-loose hosts, including Ricky Gervais and the popular duo of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. This year, the job falls to a lesser-known comic, Filipino-American standup Jo Koy. It\u2019s a big gig, though still comes with nothing like the pressure of hosting the Oscars. Oh, and they\u2019re not just about film Where the Oscars\u2019 viewership figures have declined in parallel with diminishing cinemagoing numbers, the globes have their additional television awards to lure in small screen-inclined audiences. Though the Emmys retain their reputation as the most prestigious prize in TV, the Golden Globes \u2013 drawn to shiny new things, and thus less inclined than the Emmys to pick the same winners year on year \u2013 can be more exciting on this front. It\u2019s the group that handed best series prizes to the Emmy-less likes of Brideshead Revisited, Twin Peaks, Girls and the original British version of The Office. This year, viewers can see if that trend results in wins for hot new series like The Last of Us and Jury Duty, or if past victors Succession and Abbott Elementary prevail again. Meanwhile, a brand new category for best performance in standup comedy on television \u2013 with the nominees including Ricky Gervais, Amy Schumer and Chris Rock \u2013 gives the Golden Globes a unique selling point in a crowded season of awards shows: no other major ceremony has an equivalent.",

        "body": "It\u2019s exhausting being tired all the time. Everything seems harder, gravity\u2019s pull feels heavier and bed becomes a lethargy-breeding haven. Then along comes the new year and with it the annual push to be reborn as improved humans, as though it were spring. Which it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s dark and cold and we are still recovering from a festive season of too many \u201cshoulds\u201d \u2013 should have fun, should party, should have the friends and family over for a super-feast. It is a time when even more than normal is expected of us, says psychologist Dr Linda Blair. Paying heed to all the shoulds goes some way to explaining why many of us feel low on batteries. While the thought of detoxes, boot camps and resolutions might be as appealing as a turkey smoothie, now is the time to focus instead on how to \u201csay no gracefully, without hurting feelings, when you know you\u2019re at your limit of what you can do\u201d, says Blair. Executive coach and author Viv Chitty prefers to talk about \u201cdepleted energy\u201d rather than low energy, because, she says, \u201clow energy may not necessarily be a negative state to be in\u201d. You could simply be calm, contemplative or deeply listening. Even a feeling of low energy outside those realms is not bad per se. \u201cIt means you want to rest and recuperate,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you listen to what your body and mind are telling you, you can learn what you really need.\u201d You\u2019ll know if you have problematic depleted energy, Chitty says, \u201cwhen you feel unable to focus on work, or to be interested in what\u2019s going on around you. It will affect work performance and relationships, and needs to be addressed.\u201d Here is some expert knowhow on escaping that blanket exhaustion, along with our writers\u2019 top tips for getting fired up and ready to go. Resist lie-ins Don\u2019t be tempted to go into \u201cgoblin mode\u201d just because it\u2019s cold and dark. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to feel jet-lagged,\u201d says Dr Renata Riha of the University of Edinburgh\u2019s sleep medicine department, \u201cespecially in winter when the days are short, if you sleep in too much.\u201d Instead, get up and be ready to head out once the sun has finally emerged. \u201cTake a brisk walk or even a meander in the fresh air during the hours of light, particularly early on,\u201d adds Riha, who also recommends not keeping your house too stuffy: \u201cBed socks for cold feet rather than turning the thermostat on.\u201d Stroke animals and dance \u201cWhen you touch another mammal, both of you release oxytocin,\u201d says psychologist Dr Linda Blair. It\u2019s often called the love hormone, but actually, she says, \u201cit\u2019s the safety hormone and the basis of starting to feel better is to first feel safe.\u201d Then dance. \u201cMoving to rhythm is a primitive way to communicate joy,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we\u2019re feeling tired and emotional, memories tend to clump by emotion, so bad thoughts like, \u2018I don\u2019t have any energy,\u2019 call up other bad thoughts, which make you feel worse.\u201d But if you dance to music that you associate with happy times the opposite will happen. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better, you\u2019ll feel great.\u201d Identify what fills your tank Sit down and have a think about what gives you energy and what takes it away, says executive coach and author Viv Chitty. This can include physical influences, such as nutrition, hydration, sedentary behaviour, sleep, rest, your age and the impact of hormones. But it also includes our emotions and thought processes, work, parenting and caring for elderly relatives. \u201cIdentify what fills your tank and what empties it,\u201d she Chitty. \u201cYou could have a simple diagram on your wall.\u201d Then you can figure out the steps you can take to manage the energy drains and maximise the boosters. Eat breakfast If you want more energy and focus, eat breakfast. \u201cI cannot stress enough the importance of eating breakfast,\u201d says Gavin Sandercock, professor at the University of Essex\u2019s School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences. \u201cBreakfast being defined as proper food that requires cutlery, preferably greater than 300 calories, eaten sitting down.\u201d Visualise your energy \u201cElectricity flows through our bodies, igniting everything from the neurons in our brain to cardiac cells that pump our blood,\u201d says Tracy Anderson, fitness pioneer and creator of the Tracy Anderson Method, who famously honed Madonna\u2019s athletic physique. \u201cSo when we talk about getting our energy back in the new year, it\u2019s important to remember we never lost it. Alternative ways of thinking about energy can help so, as well as working conventional muscle groups, Anderson likes to focus on her \u201cheart centre\u201d \u2013 a phrase more usually associated with yoga. She uses exercises that challenge the mind and body together. A good example is: stand with your eyes open, arms fully extended to the sides, palms facing up and fingers straight. Imagine holding something precious and vulnerable in your hands. Rotate your hands towards the ground, then towards the back wall and, finally, up towards the ceiling, while simultaneously bending into a squat with a flat back. Reverse the hand rotation as you stand up, being careful not to \u201cdrop\u201d the imaginary object. Not only will this improve physical health, she says, \u201cbut it emphasises the importance of cognitive awareness in overall wellbeing and brings a deeper understanding of the energy within your body.\u201d Socialise without stressing Author and illustrator Sophie Lucido Johnson\u2019s newsletter, You are Doing a Good Enough Job is packed with joyful ways to recharge and resist productivity culture. \u201cThe festive season teaches us that socialisation is stressful, so people tend to isolate in January,\u201d she says. \u201cFind opportunities to gather in ways that don\u2019t feel challenging, with people who don\u2019t stress you out. Instead of fraught dinners with meticulously planned menus, get together with friends and don\u2019t bother cleaning. Have a singalong or order pizza or have a gathering where everyone just drinks tea and reads books in each other\u2019s company.\u201d Do the twist Make time for a \u201ccalming and energising\u201d easy, seated twist, says yoga teacher Zoe Speekenbrink. Sit cross-legged or on your heels, rooting your weight in your sitting bones and lengthening your spine. Breathe in and, as you breathe out, twist to your right, taking your right hand to the floor behind you. Bring your left hand to the outside of your right knee. Take another breath and exhale as you move deeper into the twist, from the torso. Inhale as you come back to centre, then do the same on the other side. Light up your life Light impacts mood and increases vitality, says Linda Geddes, author of Chasing the Sun, an exploration of how light affects our health and wellbeing. Studies also show light exposure improves alertness and helps us sleep \u2013 so get outside or, failing that, give yourself a boost of light therapy with a Sad lamp. Pump up the volume Listen to the most obnoxious song you can as loudly as you can get away with. Play All I Do Is Win by DJ Khaled to your children on the way to school \u2013 it\u2019ll be like they\u2019ve been electrocharged. Is the energy constructive or destructive? Who knows? But we do know loud music releases dopamine and adrenaline \u2013 and it\u2019s a lot of fun. Start a Nap Club A nap is both illicit and wholesome; a sweet spot. Make it an event. Get your nicest blanket. Nap deliciously, on the sofa, for no more than 20 minutes. Crucially, text your friends. The first rule of Nap Club is: talk about it, a lot. Discovering your friends are slumping mid-afternoon will make you feel less useless. It may also energise you. Nothing turns around a bad night\u2019s sleep like hearing someone else had a worse one. Go to bed earlier Sleep is important, especially as you get older, so why not experiment with an earlier bedtime? This week, try going to bed an hour earlier than you usually do. What are you going to miss? Newsnight? You\u2019ll get over it. Do things you don\u2019t want to, eagerly Plans made in excitement can find us feeling less than enthusiastic when their due date rolls around. It\u2019s good to be realistic, yet we often expend more energy complaining about insufficient energy than we do on the journey or social effort. In all probability, you are going to do the thing, so do it with your whole heart. Don\u2019t see family and friends resentfully, because they\u2019ll feel it. Get the most out of whatever these occasions offer \u2013 there\u2019s always something. You can complain afterwards, if you still want to. Most times, you won\u2019t. Turn your home into a spa A bath, with candles. Body scrub, face masks. Relaxing playlist. Above all, permission. Set aside an afternoon or evening. If they\u2019re not awful at it, get your partner to give you a massage. The best things in life are not free, but you can definitely get all this for about \u00a310. Change the lights When LED bulbs start to fail, the light they give out sort of\u2026 sours. The temperature of the room falls. Recommended: Philips Dimmable A60 LED bulbs. Eat fashionably seasonally People who eat seasonally are forever telling others they should, too. They don\u2019t really want them to, though, as then they wouldn\u2019t be special. But here\u2019s the rub. We all should eat seasonally \u2013 and not just for point-scoring. Fruit and veg that travel the fewest miles come loaded with the most nutrients and zingy minerals, and will supercharge you. Think of it as seasonal fashion. Apples and Jerusalem artichokes are very in right now. Perfect a new but useless skill Learn the Eurasian screech owl call; or a magic trick; or how to walk a coin across your knuckles, or play Eye of the Tiger by flicking your cheeks. A nice, sedentary, time-intensive trick that will garner you minor, perhaps odd, but still significant kudos at parties. Stop buying new clothes It\u2019s easier than you think, now there\u2019s Vestiaire and Vinted. Make the seller an offer they can\u2019t refuse \u2013 on Vinted you can offer up to 40% below the asking price. Get some sheepskin inner soles When winter is properly bedded in, \u00a35 for a spring in your step is a bargain. Scent your bedroom like a hotel Either splash out on a luxe diffuser or make your own water spray with ingredients like witch hazel with lemon, clove or lavender essential oils. Drink more, achieve more Drink way more water than you usually would. Sure, hydration is good for energy, but nothing focuses the mind like really, really needing a wee. Why not set yourself a task, and refuse to allow yourself to go to the toilet until it\u2019s been completed? You\u2019ll get it done in record time. Make like a squirrel In a recent TikTok, actor Jennifer Garner became hysterical laughing at how many packets of nuts she had squirrelled away in her handbag (eight). Garner has the right idea though: research on their benefits appears constantly, for both physical and cognitive health. Eat nuts! Plot a (very) slow art crawl Get more beauty into your life: if there\u2019s an artist whose work you enjoy, explore where you could see more of it, then plan trips over the next year, or even decade. If you love Bellini, say, there are beautiful works of his in London, Birmingham and Glasgow. But why not start dreaming of a trip to his hometown of Venice, too? Living in the moment is great, but having plans to look forward to can really switch the lights on when things feel dark. Create professional boundaries Nothing depletes a person like receiving a work email out of office hours, and knowing you\u2019re expected to reply promptly. Set up an out-of-office at the end of every working day, basically saying: \u201cI\u2019ll reply to this tomorrow when I start work again.\u201d Suddenly you have tons more time to spend on other things, like fretting that your boss is going to fire you for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Think vertically Anyone who is planning to throw off the laziness and gluttony of the past month will be thinking about getting fitter. But plodding round the streets, often in the dark and the rain, is no fun. Instead, next time you are in the office, head for the emergency stairwell and start running up the stairs, two or three at a time. It\u2019s high intensity, builds speed, power and cardiovascular fitness, and helps with agility, balance and foot speed. It also means you can boast about being on the cusp of a new fad: vertical marathons. Scream your head off If you are feeling stifled, take a lesson from the tantruming two-year-old and let it all out at the top of your voice. There\u2019s good evidence that \u201cprimal scream therapy\u201d works on many levels, but you don\u2019t need to worry about that. Just go to a field, garden, park or cupboard under the stairs and shout as loud as you can. You will feel instantly empowered. Avoid dry January Do we need to say more? Yes, drink in moderation, but denial is going to give you the opposite of a well-needed boost. Go for a swing This has to be the easiest of all. Next time you walk past a playground, pop in and sit on a swing. The zen-like repetition, the feeling in your tummy, the sheer silliness of it is wonderfully life-affirming. Better still, it\u2019s good for you, you are outdoors and you\u2019re living in the moment. Contributors: Emma Beddington, Stuart Heritage, Martin Love, Rhik Samadder and Eva Wiseman",

        "body": "Willem Dafoe is in his apartment in New York, where he is watched over by two works of art. Behind him is an oil painting of his father, a prop created for a film, which required \u201cdynastic portraits\u201d of his relatives. \u201cI liked my father fine, so, there he is.\u201d We are talking on Zoom and he spins the camera round. \u201cBut look, even better! Here\u2019s the counterpoint. Do you see that?\u201d To the side of him is a large, lightbox photograph of his friend and occasional collaborator, the artist Marina Abramovi\u0107, standing priest-like over a naked body adorned with organs. \u201cAnyway, you get the idea,\u201d he says. Dafoe is less the kind of actor who wants to discuss his three-hour morning workout routine and more the type who will get stuck into the bigger stuff. We are here to talk about Poor Things, the stunning new Yorgos Lanthimos film, based on the novel by Alasdair Gray. Dafoe stars as a reclusive genius scientist named Godwin Baxter \u2013 God, for short \u2013 who creates life in the form of Emma Stone\u2019s Bella. It is a gorgeous, thrilling adventure and it could be the film to earn Dafoe, who slaps on heavy prosthetics to play God, his fifth Oscar nomination. His first was for Platoon, in 1987, and he has been working solidly, voraciously even, since 1980, making more than 150 films in five decades, with every interesting director in the business, from David Lynch to Wes Anderson, from Werner Herzog to Paul Schrader and Martin Scorsese. Dafoe, 68, is back in New York only briefly. He first moved to the city in 1977, when he was 22, because he wanted to be a commercial theatre actor, but he fell in with an arty crowd and joined an experimental theatre collective called the Wooster Group instead. It was there he met his first partner, with whom he had a son in 1982. He\u2019s lived in New York on and off since then, though less so now. In the early 00s, he married an Italian woman, the director Giada Colagrande, 48, with whom he now lives in Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like I go back to a different life than I have normally,\u201d he says. He has Italian friends, Italian family, speaks Italian. And then there are the animals. We were due to speak in the summer, but Poor Things was pushed back due to the actors\u2019 strike, which also meant that Dafoe stopped working for almost four months. \u201cI love to work,\u201d he says, \u201cand it was longer than I like to go.\u201d But it was fine, mostly, because of his small farm. \u201cI never know how much to talk about this,\u201d he says, a little warily. \u201cBasically, let\u2019s say, I was a gentleman farmer.\u201d I am sure I am not the only one who would like to know more. \u201cOh, OK. Well, maybe you\u2019ll get a little out of me.\u201d Dafoe had never even had pets before, but now, he has \u201clots of animals\u201d and a vegetable garden, just outside Rome. Why does he keep animals? \u201cI\u2019m basically a vegetarian, so I do it just for the pleasure of their company and to try to give them a good life, which is a little naive.\u201d They take eggs from the chickens and turkeys, and wool from the sheep and alpacas. At one point he refers to \u201cother people\u201d on the farm. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d he says, catching himself. \u201cOther people!\u201d He means the animals. A few months ago, Dafoe\u2019s Poor Things co-star Mark Ruffalo posted a picture of the two of them with an alpaca, which briefly lit up the internet. So that was your alpaca? He nods. \u201cA baby. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Do they have personalities? \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the whole thing. Each one is very distinct. With sheep and goats, some you know well, some have names and they really stick, but some are just sheep and goats. But every alpaca, you have a whole particular relationship with, and you know their character.\u201d The gentleman farmer sounds like a very different lifestyle to either Hollywood or the New York theatre scene. \u201cIt is, but still, it\u2019s like being at the theatre. I wake up, I hit the ground running. My day is dedicated to doing things and taking care of things. Idle hands are the devil\u2019s workshop, what can I tell ya?\u201d He grins. \u201cAnother reason I don\u2019t like to talk about it is, I remember one of the first movies I was in.\u201d It was called Heaven\u2019s Gate, in 1980. \u201cI had never been in a studio or Hollywood movie before. I was used to being with the downtown crowd in New York, in a very fertile period. When I went on set, I thought everybody would be talking about poetry and film and philosophy. And everybody was talking about their dogs and their horses and their ranches, and I thought, this is a drag, ya know? And now, I\u2019ve become one of them.\u201d Dafoe has always existed between the mainstream and an artier scene, adjusting the balance over the years. There has been much mythologising of New York City in 1977. Was he part of that world? \u201cI was very much there, but we also were kind of insular, in the respect that it was a tough life and it was hard to survive. We didn\u2019t have the money to hang out at Max\u2019s Kansas City all the time. You would go to CBGBs, you\u2019d go to Mudd Club, but it wasn\u2019t a regular thing.\u201d When he first arrived, he was fresh from touring Europe with a travelling theatre company, and he thought he would become a professional stage actor. \u201cBut I found myself not being interested in pursuing that and hanging out with people that had very little ambition. Not until later did people really become kind of careerist about it. Because there was no career to be had, there was no audience for it.\u201d Clearly, he has had a long and successful career himself. Was there snobbery around the idea of success? \u201cOf course. Because grabbing at the brass ring \u2013 the brass ring was bullshit, you know? Why grab? Make our own brass ring. I think there was some truth to that.\u201d Dafoe has worked with scores of directors, many of whom have used him to challenging effect, whether in the psychosexual horrors of Lars von Trier or the earthy folk terrors of Robert Eggers; he has played Jesus Christ, starred in Antichrist. But he has done plenty of blockbusters in his time, from Speed 2 to Spider-Man. If it doesn\u2019t sound rude, I say, you have sort of grabbed at the brass ring, too. \u201cYeah, and listen, I\u2019ve been very fortunate. But I do want to say that I\u2019m always amazed when people have some success and they\u2019re kind of in denial, and still treat themselves as outsiders.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI find that kind of rude. I don\u2019t want to be that guy.\u201d I want to know what Dafoe thinks about the movies today. He has pointed out before that when he did Spider-Man, in 2002, it was an anomaly: movies weren\u2019t really made from comic books then. Now, superheroes dominate and many argue that between the blockbusters and the arthouse, there\u2019s no middle ground left. At first, he demurs and says he doesn\u2019t really think about it, because, as always, he\u2019s too busy working. But then he warms up. \u201cWhen something like the strike happens, I wake up and say, \u2018Listen, baby, you got to figure some of this stuff out,\u2019 because otherwise you\u2019re driving blind, you know?\u201d Listen, baby, this is what Dafoe has figured out. The easy one, he says, is that people watch films differently now, at home, rather than at the cinemas, which are closing down. \u201cWhich is tragic, because the kind of attention that people give at home isn\u2019t the same. More difficult movies, more challenging movies can not do as well, when you don\u2019t have an audience that\u2019s really paying attention. That\u2019s a big thing. I miss the social thing of where movies fit in the world. You go see a movie, you go out to dinner, you talk about it later, and that spreads out. People now go home, they say, \u2018Hey, honey, let\u2019s watch something stupid tonight,\u2019 and they flip through and they watch five minutes of 10 movies, and they say, forget it, let\u2019s go to bed. Where\u2019s that discourse found?\u201d The studios have changed, too. \u201cThey aren\u2019t making movies the same way they used to. They\u2019re being financed by toy companies and other entities, and they become the vehicle to make the movies, because they know how to do that. Streaming, they\u2019re becoming like a monopoly, they have the means of production and distribution. And so it\u2019s very complicated.\u201d He says again that he doesn\u2019t really know anything, that his friends who work in Hollywood more know better than him. \u201cI\u2019m a crummy source, a lousy source, to have a really good overview on what has changed.\u201d It sounds like he has a good overview to me. \u201cJust socially,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t really know the business part of it. I just noticed that there\u2019s been a proliferation of middlemen. There aren\u2019t ballsy producers like there used to be. There are some savvy ones, but you don\u2019t have the same kind of characters that you used to have, that would sell their house to make a movie, and do crazy things to get it done. They\u2019re a little harder to find.\u201d Dafoe always has several projects on the go. Another of the films he made recently is Gonzo Girl, Patricia Arquette\u2019s directorial debut, which sees him playing one of those crazy types, not a producer, but a Hunter S Thompson-esque writer, whose creativity has long since been subsumed by excess. He has a different name, but is very much based on Thompson. \u201cOf course, we borrow a lot from the real-life character, but I never wanted to do an imitation. That\u2019s why biopics that try to do an imitation always drive me crazy, because it ultimately becomes a show of the actor. Somewhere that embarrasses me and repels me. Really. And the actors that repel me are ones that are too needy.\u201d In an industry stuffed with inflated egos, then, it sounds as if Dafoe\u2019s ego is pretty healthy. \u201cI hope what you say is true,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course, we need an ego to get out of bed. To want to do things, we have to have some sense of self. But we don\u2019t want to delude ourselves to think that we\u2019re one thing, to be inflexible, to think that we\u2019re special.\u201d Is he a spiritual person? \u201cOh, God,\u201d he says, mock-appalled, but he indulges the question. \u201cListen. I\u2019m interested in spiritual impulse, and I\u2019m interested in religious thought, but you can\u2019t talk about these things publicly, and you shouldn\u2019t talk about them, because then you fall into the trap of making that your identity.\u201d For example, he\u2019s been doing yoga for 40 years and sometimes it comes up in interviews. It\u2019s a big part of his life. \u201cBut I don\u2019t like to talk about it, because every time you bring it up, if someone doesn\u2019t have the same reference, you\u2019re kind of saying, you\u2019re missing out, you don\u2019t have it, this is a beautiful thing for me, and then you just want to kill yourself! For being an asshole!\u201d Is it better, as an actor, to have people know nothing about you? \u201cI think that\u2019s true. I know that when I know someone has really repellent politics, it changes how I watch them.\u201d When he is talking about Poor Things, he is often asked about the prosthetics. \u201cThe second I hear myself saying, \u2018Yeah, it took four hours to get in and two hours to get out, and I was there at 3am\u2026\u2019 You don\u2019t want people thinking about that when they\u2019re watching the movie.\u201d I wonder if Dafoe, with his 150-plus movies and his theatre and his art and his alpacas, is easily bored. \u201cNot at all!\u201d he replies, immediately. \u201cI\u2019m never bored. In fact, it\u2019s probably the greatest feature of getting older. When I was younger, I was bored and restless a lot. I always have things I want to do and there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day.\u201d This sounds like a nice state to live in. \u201cIt\u2019s only come as I\u2019ve gotten older and other things have gone as I\u2019ve gotten older, and it\u2019s a good trade-off, I\u2019d say.\u201d What has he lost? \u201cNot much, you know, maybe a little muscle tone and thickness of eyebrows and your lips get thinner. No, I\u2019m joking, but I\u2019m not joking\u2026\u201d He laughs. \u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, it feels like an open road much more. Once you get further down the line, you start to think about the under-the-line a lot more.\u201d He used to be the youngest person in every group. \u201cNow I\u2019m the oldest. I read all the time about people I\u2019ve worked with dying, and it\u2019s like, what happened? And it\u2019s like, well, they were 82 years old,\u201d he says. Younger people are often motivated by a need to find their place in the world. \u201cI think it\u2019s no accident that there are different stages of life and I don\u2019t have a preference for one or the other, but not everything has to happen when you\u2019re young. A lot can happen later.\u201d It sounds as if Dafoe has never been busier. He is about to start work on another film, with the former associate director of the Young Vic, Nadia Latif. He has already finished another film with Lanthimos and Stone. And then there is Beetlejuice 2. A couple of days earlier, Dafoe had let slip that he is playing an undead detective. \u201cDo me a favour,\u201d he says, annoyed at himself. \u201cI said this two days ago, and I regret it, because it occurs to me that Tim Burton is probably one of those people who doesn\u2019t like people to talk about the movie. I think he probably thought, \u2018That fucker, he should have kept his mouth shut!\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cI had a weak moment, ya know! I spilled the beans, as they say.\u201d Fashion editor Helen Seamons; grooming by Jennie Roberts at Frank Agency using Woolf Kings X and Glossier; Fashion assistant Sam Deaman; tailor Nick James; photography assistants Alex Cornes, Philip Banks and Brandon Hepworth; shot at Stockwell Studio.

        "body": "More than half of people who join a gym do so to tackle an illness and three-quarters find that keeping fit boosts their mental health, new research shows. The findings come as hundreds of thousands of people across the UK join or rejoin a gym, swimming pool or leisure centre as part of a new year resolution to improve their fitness. Survey findings commissioned by ukactive, which represents fitness operators, found that 55% of gym-goers felt their membership was important in helping them manage a short- or long-term health condition. And more than three in four (78%) said that going to the gym has a positive impact on their mental health and wellbeing, while two-thirds (66%) said they found that exercising helps them to sleep better. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that more people are seeing the true value of being active and its role in leading a fulfilling life,\u201d said Huw Edwards, ukactive\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to see people getting such crucial benefits from physical activity and more are now seeing fitness and leisure facilities as places in the community that can really help them look after their health and wellbeing.\u201d About 10.3 million people in the UK belong to a gym. Early January usually sees a surge in people joining because they have decided to try to get fitter but not everyone keeps up the habit. \u201cBecoming more active and achieving a healthy weight is known to provide long-term benefits to people and their communities,\u201d said Matthew Fagg, NHS England\u2019s director for prevention and long-term conditions, responding to the findings. The NHS uses physical activity as a key element of its programmes to help diabetics manage their condition, smokers to quit and the overweight to slim down, he added. Edwards urged ministers to do more to support the fitness industry, especially with a record 2.6 million Britons currently unable to work because they are struggling with an illness. Employers should be able to offer staff gym memberships or home fitness equipment as a perk and then claim the costs against tax, he said. He also called for an overhaul of VAT to incentivise gym membership \u2013 as Ireland has done \u2013 and a reform of business rates to encourage more gyms, pools and fitness facilities to open. Andy Bell, the chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said: \u201cPhysical activity has been shown to benefit our mental health. And people living with a long-term physical health condition are twice as likely to have a mental health difficulty. \u201cBut access to leisure facilities and green spaces isn\u2019t equal, and people with the poorest mental health often have the least access to opportunities for physical activity.\u201d But David Minton, a leisure industry analyst, said that gyms are doing too little to attract more people not aged between 16 and 34, who are the group most likely to be a member. They should also target older people with high cholesterol or musculoskeletal problems, he said. \u201cAs a species we are very poor at adopting simple behaviours that are proven to improve our healthy mobility. The fitness industry needs to adopt a fresh approach to both language and marketing to attract a wider audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIn January many new people will find a sense of purpose whilst improving their healthy mobility. The sector needs to convert these members and customers into fans and ambassadors by helping them achieve a more active lifestyle.\u201d",

        "body": "In arguing for more building on land within green belts, Nicholas Boys Smith seems not to appreciate their actual purpose (England\u2019s green belt can\u2019t stay entirely untouched for ever, building design tsar says, 2 January). He fails to recognise that green belts are there to prevent most new development as a matter of principle, irrespective of its design quality. Green belts were not established to protect agricultural land, nor were they concerned with \u201camenity value\u201d. Established in 1955, the original purpose of green belts was \u201cto check the growth of a large built up area, to prevent neighbouring settlements from merging into another, or to preserve the special character of a town\u201d. In the 1980s the then Greater Manchester council, when drawing up the first comprehensive green belt for the conurbation, established a further critical purpose, namely to assist in urban regeneration \u2013 an objective subsequently adopted nationally by the Conservative government, despite being vigorously opposed by the big housebuilders of the day (something I remember well as a planner defending our approach at a 60-day public inquiry). Green belts are established as part of a rational local planning process, fully engaging with communities, and subject to rigorous public examination. While, once in place, they are certainly expected to be valid for the long term, like any other planning policy, they are subject to periodic review \u2013 as indeed has happened in Greater Manchester, where (after about 40 years) some adjustments to the boundaries have been made in order to reflect current housing and economic requirements. To suggest simplistically, as both the main political parties are doing, that an evidence-based policy such as green belt designation is the reason for the housing crisis (and thus that the planning system is \u201cbroken\u201d) simply makes an honest examination of the multiple failures of the last 14 years even more unlikely. David Kaiserman Wilmslow, Cheshire \u2022 It\u2019s not possible, as Nicholas Boys Smith seems to believe, to talk intelligently about housing and development without mentioning either genuinely social (ie not \u201caffordable\u201d) housing or developers\u2019 profits and their contributions to politicians. Developers prefer to \u201cchuck a cul-de-sac in a field\u201d, as he says, because greenfield land (not necessarily green belt) is cheaper to develop, and people are willing to buy the resulting houses with their three parking spaces and no public transport nearby. They build at low density because detached housing is somehow aspirational. They already use pattern books, as Boys Smith recommends, just not good ones. Georgian and Victorian pattern books gave a range of dwelling provision, with carefully thought-out facilities and spacing, and subtle changes of decoration \u2013 a little like the Parker Morris standards that the Thatcher government ditched. But however many planning permissions developers are given, they will never develop at a rate that risks undermining their profits. Gordon Brown and his economic adviser on housing, Kate Barker, both believed that all that was necessary to make prices affordable was to build in sufficient volume. That magical thinking has blighted planning ever since. And the housebuilders\u2019 contributions to the Tory party especially have blighted any hope of better provision. Starmer\u2019s proposal to cut the discounts available on right to buy for any remaining council houses is a step in the right direction. But the only solution for the millions of people of all ages living without secure housing is to build council housing once more, and return to the original intention that it should be normal tenure, not a desperate last measure for those with no other option. And restore the ability of councils to design and manage it, reversing the last 40 years of outsourcing and downgrading of local authorities. That will be a long slog, but it\u2019s essential.

        "body": "Advice can be a funny thing. It can slide off like Teflon or land right where, and when, you need it. Back in 2017 my mate Kearnsie had popped round for a cuppa and a chat. As we sat in the sunny kitchen with tea and bickies, I looked through the goodies she\u2019d brought along for my wife and I\u2019s pending arrival. After four years of trying, our first kid was on the way. Blooming beautifully in my wife\u2019s belly. We knew everything would change, and to be frank, we were freaking out. Kearnsie had brought some special bits and bobs she\u2019d saved from when her kids were little: gorgeous vintage overalls and tiny terry-towelling T-shirts. It wasn\u2019t all she gave us that day. As we leaned in to absorb the answers to questions we fired off about every potential need this baby would have, we hungrily took mental notes. Thankfully someone around here knew what they were doing. The chat changed direction and we started musing about our identities as fully formed adults with our own needs and wants. When would we be able to be us again, as a couple and as individuals? Was that time over? It was a simple phrase but one that hit like a lightning bolt. She said it like it was no big deal. \u201cYou\u2019re still you, but with kids.\u201d Oh! It hadn\u2019t occurred to either of us, really. I had grappled with this idea that I would have to disappear, to be a carbon copy of my mother (lovely as she is), to sacrifice everything I need to feel alive and safe. But Kearnsie had given me this epic yet simple reassurance \u2013 I\u2019m still me \u2026 with kids. That baby has just wrapped up their first year at school. It\u2019s been a huge success with lots of friends and a new reading habit. Just like they\u2019ve found their own groove outside our home and away from us, when the time was right my partner and I did the same. We\u2019ve both had career changes that followed our interests, and faced the requisite existential crises and rapid life changes people tend to at this stage of the game. When we\u2019d approach one another with a fanciful idea and felt a bit shy about making these leaps, the other would gently offer a reminder. \u201cRemember Kearnsie? You\u2019re you, with kids.\u201d Inhabiting who we are has helped us thrive. It wasn\u2019t just the big moments either. When a baby-shaped sleepy potato pudding joins your family, the first stretch is spent in protection mode. How do we best keep this person alive and flourishing? It\u2019s easy to forget that you have a spine that needs to be held at a certain angle to prevent ongoing crushing agony. Many a midnight I whispered to myself \u201cI\u2019m me, with a baby\u201d as I strapped my fussy babe into the gentle automated rocker we found on marketplace. I was present and protecting both of us, seeing the way we both had needs. As we got to know each other, I learned my baby\u2019s rhythms and knew when the rocker could stand in and when I could gather them up in my arms to deposit safely in their cot. We\u2019d both get a better night\u2019s sleep and be ready to roll as the sun came up. Needs will never be in short supply in any household. Rapid change and endless days and nights are all part and parcel of parenting, and if you don\u2019t check in with yourself it\u2019s easy for your awareness of your own needs to disappear. I hold on to the idea that I matter, even though my children also matter. There\u2019s ample room for all of us.",

        "body": "Barbie might be bust It went into the race with the most nominations (nine) but came home with a couple of consolation prizes: for Billie Eilish\u2019s song, and the new award for making lots of money. How come? Well, it\u2019s an unusually strong year, especially in the categories Barbie had the best shot in: Margot Robbie was never realistically going to beat Emma Stone (for Poor Things), who herself looks now likely to be knocked out by Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019s Lily Gladstone for the best female actor prize when it\u2019s not split between comedy and drama. There may also be a sense that, although the great pink saviour did wonderful things for cinema, she oughtn\u2019t to hog all the glory as well as the cash and buzz. Leaning to Oppenheimer instead allows for the concession that press and popularity are a good thing, but keeps things donnish too. Anyway, sadly, Sunday\u2019s snub does bode badly for Barbie. After all, if the Globes weren\u2019t going to give the nod to Ryan Gosling for his definition-of-a-supporting-turn (the supporting actor award went to Robert Downey Jr for Oppenheimer), then more august bodies are unlikely to. Maestro could benefit from its Globes cold-shouldering Bradley Cooper\u2019s decade-in-the-prep transformation into Leonard Bernstein would traditionally have fast-tracked him to being smothered in silverware. But he was shunned in favour of Cillian Murphy \u2013 a popular winner, but not so much of a lock that the sympathy vote might not give Cooper (who has now lost six times at the Globes) the edge later in the race. Don\u2019t discount The Holdovers Classy and charming speeches from Paul Giamatti and Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph will only fuel the bonhomie felt in Hollywood for Alexander Payne\u2019s intimate comedy-drama: a movie less potentially polarising than Oppenheimer, Poor Things or Killers of the Flower Moon. A minority dislike each of those three. The Holdovers seems to leave nobody cold. Might it yet split the vote at the Oscars? Christmas party season is still going strong in Hollywood The stars were a little thin on the ground at last year\u2019s Globes, and those who did show up looked slightly unsure whether they should have. This year, everyone and their mother rocked up and looked ecstatic to be doing so. The whole awards season this year is defined by a post-strike headiness, and there is a palpable sense of enjoyment in the usual conveyor belt of interviews and red carpet opportunities which bespeaks of a thousand showboats grounded for many months. People seem genuinely pleased to see each other, and to talk about their work. Can this be sustained another two months until the Oscars? A test of acting prowess may be required. Politics is not on the agenda The hot water some stars found themselves in after wading in with their opinions on the Israel-Gaza war may have acted as a considerable deterrent to anyone who fancied having their say at the ceremony. But after so many references last year to the Globes\u2019s own racism, as well as Ukraine, as well as the long-bubbling anti-Trump nods, perhaps serious hat fatigue had set in. The closest we got were Gladstone using her speech to speak Blackfeet and reflect that \u201cNative actors used to speak their lines in English and then the sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera\u201d. That and Gillian Anderson\u2019s anatomical frock. The Globes still don\u2019t know a good thing when they have it Get Taylor Swift in the room \u2013 great! But then give her neither a prize nor a chance to air her pipes, and add insult to injury with a terrible joke \u2013 not so good. The producers of this year\u2019s show exposed their lack of judgment with endless missteps, not confined to hiring Jo Koy as the worst awards host in living memory. His lack of panache was highlighted by the smooth success of the presenting skits by the likes of Will Ferrell and Kirsten Wiig \u2013 and by the Globes\u2019s most successful host, Ricky Gervais, picking up the new standup prize. Jennifer Lawrence is still an awards season asset Up for female comedy actor for her role in the knockabout sex comedy No Hard Feelings, Lawrence \u2013 who didn\u2019t have a shot \u2013 gamely mouthed \u201cIf I don\u2019t win, I\u2019m leaving\u201d to the reaction camera which every other nominee studiously attempts to ignore when their name is read out. Second prize in the casual-knowingness-about-camera-placement awards goes to Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Kylie Jenner, who splashily canoodled in the ad breaks. The new voters are properly international Much of the original, tainted, 90-odd membership of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association were binned along with the name (despite a few confused speeches still hat-tipping them), with a properly foreign and diverse 180 or so taking their place. Whoever the new voters are, they do have some taste, giving the best animation prize to The Boy and the Heron, and lock-stepping with the Cannes jury over Justine Triet\u2019s courtroom drama Anatomy of a Fall, which took best screenplay as well as best foreign language film and now looks a certainty for a best picture Oscar nomination. Meryl Streep can lose Never bet against Meryl Streep \u2013 but maybe if you do, put down a lot of cash. Few could have foreseen Streep would be denied a record-setting 10th Globe win for her turn in Only Murders in the Building, and fewer still that she\u2019d be trounced by Elizabeth Debicki as Ghost Diana in The Crown. The Globes are still shutting out the season\u2019s best films A few of the snubs \u2013 Saltburn; May December \u2013 could be seen coming. Sadly the same could also be said for the yet more egregious slights. There was nothing for The Zone of Interest. Nothing for All of Us Strangers. Not a sausage for Past Lives. Business as usual.",

        "body": "What better way to start the new year with what will surely be remembered as one of its worst films. This mashup of magical realism, gratuitous violence and sentimentality is an atrocity in filmic form. It\u2019s only a bit offensive for its appropriation of the Holocaust as a dramatic engine. What really stirs revulsion is the film\u2019s smug delusions of quality, a self-belief so strong that it has the gall to take two hours and 21 minutes to unfurl itself to the end. Everyone who whined about Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon being too long should be strapped to a chair, like Malcolm McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, and forced to watch this in order to understand the difference between a film that\u2019s long because it has a lot to say and one that actively seeks to make its viewers stupider after watching it. So here\u2019s the plot. The year is 1943 and the small Mezza Piotta circus has set up in Rome. Run by kindly impresario Israel (Giorgio Tirabassi), the circus stars are an assortment of so-called freaks, a quartet with X-Men/Miss Peregrine\u2019s Home for Peculiar Children/Angela Carter-like abilities. Cencio (Pietro Castellitto) can control insects with his mind, although he has issues with bees. Mario (Giancarlo Martini) is a clown human magnet. Fulvio (Claudio Santamaria) is covered in hair like a cheap Chewbacca costume but has superhuman strength. Finally, ingenue Matilde (Aurora Giovinazzo) is so full of electricity that she shocks anyone who touches her \u2013 except when she doesn\u2019t because the script is terminally lazy. When Israel is hauled away east to the death camps and the gang are separated, Matilde embarks on a picaresque adventure to find them all. Meanwhile, there is a Nazi circus ringmaster in town named Franz (Franz Rogowski) who likes to huff ether because it gives him visions of the future (don\u2019t try this at home, kids); he also has extra pinkies on each hand which enables him to play Creep by Radiohead very fast on the piano. Franz wants to capture the players from the Mezza Piotta who he\u2019s seen in his visions and do mean stuff to them \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly clear what his goal is. Rogowski has been showered with praise for his performances of late, especially as a polyamorous narcissist in Passages, but any awards bodies thinking of bestowing prizes on him may wish to reconsider if they see his silly mugging and gurning in this, leaping about antically like a labradoodle chasing a Chuckit! ball. Sidenote: it\u2019s also offensive the way this Italian film pushes the entirety of the blame for Jewish persecution on to the Germans, as if Mussolini and the 1938 racial laws didn\u2019t even exist, and posits that all Italians are nice and it\u2019s just those beastly Teutons from up north who did everything. Somehow you can imagine it\u2019s the kind of idea current prime minister Giorgia Meloni would like. \u2022 Freaks vs the Reich is released on 12 January in UK and Irish cinemas.",

        "body": "These are strange times for Ramy Youssef. On the one hand, he is about to appear in his first big movie role, in the delightfully surreal and sexed-up fantasia Poor Things. After his hit comedy drama series Ramy, it looks like the beginning of a new phase in his career. On the other hand, the Israel-Gaza war is dominating the news, and as one of the most prominent Muslim entertainers out there, Egyptian American Youssef is very much in the spotlight. These two worlds are colliding the day we meet in December. Youssef is tangentially in the headlines as a result of Taylor Swift having attended his standup show in New York a few days previously, with celebrity friends Selena Gomez and Cara Delevingne. Youssef is donating all the proceeds from the remainder of his standup tour to the Palestinian NGO American Near East Refugee Aid. This was too much for the rightwing presenter Megyn Kelly, who declared that Swift \u201cowes Israelis and Jewish Americans an apology\u201d, and urged people to \u201cboycott her events until she issues one\u201d, telling Swift \u201cwhen it comes to talking about those issues again, you clearly know nothing\u201d. Never mind that it was actually Youssef doing the talking, not Swift \u2013 it\u2019s an illustration of how difficult it is for him to simply enjoy his rising stardom. As we talk at a London hotel, saccharine Christmas music playing in the background, the conversation often lurches between lighthearted and deadly serious, although anyone who has watched Ramy will know that Youssef is well accustomed to this mode. \u201cI don\u2019t pay much attention to it,\u201d he says of the Megyn Kelly stuff, leaning in close on the sofa. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the act of helping innocent people getting politicised, and then it turning into this whole other thing, so I don\u2019t really give it much time.\u201d He describes Swift as \u201ca new friend\u201d \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s really funny, actually, and really cool.\u201d It\u2019s easy to assume that Youssef is just like Ramy, the character he plays on TV, but five years and three seasons on, the two identities are diverging ever further. \u201cRamy\u201d is an aimless but likable New Jersey millennial, still living with his immigrant parents and working for his gem-trader uncle, forever trying to reconcile Muslim and western values, but usually too weak to transcend his shallow desires (those puppy-dog eyes make him quite the hit with the ladies). \u201cThe show is really just about higher self and lower self,\u201d Youssef says. \u201cIt\u2019s about who we want to be and who we actually are.\u201d In real life, 32-year-old Youssef is now a writer, producer and director (as well as episodes of his own show, he has directed an episode of The Bear), as well as an actor and a comic. He has won awards and critical adulation, he\u2019s hanging with the likes of Swift and the model Bella Hadid (who had a guest role on Ramy), and now he\u2019s on the big screen punching Mark Ruffalo and having his ear licked by Emma Stone. Any apprehension Youssef might have had about stepping on to a movie set was dispelled during three weeks of \u201ccrazy theatre games\u201d that Poor Things director Yorgos Lanthimos arranged before shooting. \u201cThe rehearsal for all of us knocked out any impostor syndrome we might have had,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the time we got to shoot, it almost felt like you had embarrassed yourself so much over the last three weeks that there was nothing to be afraid of.\u201d What kind of games? \u201cYou know, physical stuff. Rolling around on the floor, doing an interpretive dance on cue, things that you would be a little shy to do in front of your improv group, and now you\u2019re doing them in front of Willem Dafoe.\u201d He describes making Poor Things as \u201ca surreal dream\u201d, which is a fair description of the movie itself. Adapted from Alasdair Gray\u2019s 1992 novel, and set in a parallel 1880s Europe, the film is a singular mix of gothic horror and absurdist comedy, with an avowedly feminist stance. Stone\u2019s shameless heroine, Bella, is an experiment of Dafoe\u2019s mad scientist, who sets off on her own journey of intellectual and sexual self-discovery. Youssef plays the essentially sweet-natured Max, who is assigned by Dafoe to first study Bella, then marry her \u2013 though things don\u2019t go at all to plan. \u201cThere\u2019s a really fine line between him being sincere and him being creepy,\u201d says Youssef of his character. \u201cAnd I felt, OK, I think I know how to handle this.\u201d Despite being largely set in Britain, Poor Things\u2019 main stars are all American. \u201cWe had this great moment on set where Christopher Abbott [who plays Alfie] was like, \u2018Dude, it\u2019s always the Brits playing the Americans. And now we\u2019re doing it!\u2019. He was so happy. It was like, finally, we got one on the board.\u201d Youssef nails the English accent impressively. One of his best buddies is a British Cypriot from Barnet, north-west London, he explains: \u201cI realised when I started working on the accent, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m copying him.\u2019\u201d Acting beyond Ramy was always part of the plan. \u201cI\u2019ve been really fortunate how well the show\u2019s been received, but I think in the back of my head I also knew, yeah, my name is Ramy and I\u2019m playing Ramy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that there\u2019s this whole other realm of acting where you really just step into a character.\u201d When he was 20, Youssef dropped out of university to enrol in acting school in New York, but his early career failed to launch. \u201cWhen I was auditioning before, no one ever really knew what to do with me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be like, \u2018You\u2019re not quite ethnic enough to do the ethnic thing.\u2019 And then also, \u2018We\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re the friend or if you\u2019re the lead.\u2019 There was always this ambiguity about what I could do.\u201d This was in the US in the noughties, when largely the only roles available to vaguely \u201cArab\u201d actors were terrorists. Youssef was 10 years old when 9/11 happened, and as a Muslim American, life changed overnight. He later incorporated his childhood memories into a flashback episode of Ramy, including nightmares about Osama bin Laden, and the concurrent emergence of his adolescent sexuality. \u201c9/11 and me jerking off for the first time happened in the same year,\u201d he once said. He began doing standup when he was in high school, with friends including Steve Way, who plays one of his best friends in Ramy and has muscular dystrophy. \u201cI actually sometimes don\u2019t know how funny I was as a kid,\u201d he muses. \u201cI was maybe a bit more in my feelings than funny. I think the humour came by surprise to me when I started making things. I loved videotaping things and editing them, making music videos and writing little sketches with my friends. And little by little, I was like, \u2018Oh, I guess I should be in them.\u2019 And then I started to kind of find this other side of myself, but I\u2019m probably the least funny person in my family. My mom is one of the funniest people I\u2019ve ever met. She can joke between Arabic and English and French and cut up the whole room.\u201d His parents were both born in Cairo but met in New York, where his grandfather was a UN interpreter for 30 years, before settling in New Jersey. The adversity of his upbringing at least gave him a trove of material. In his first appearance on network TV, on Stephen Colbert\u2019s show in 2017, he began by saying: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Ramy Youssef. I\u2019m Muslim \u2026 like, from the news,\u201d before joking that when he turned 30 he expected to get \u201ca Hogwarts letter from Isis\u201d. But one of the strengths of Ramy the show is how it avoids such easy laughs in favour of depth and authenticity. For non-Muslim viewers, it\u2019s a window into a reality and a point of view that had never really been represented in mainstream media \u2013 the complexities of family, integration, prejudices, sex, sexuality, gender, guilt and shame. Some have accused the show of stereotyping, but Youssef says he never sought to speak for an entire culture or religion: \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to do that. There\u2019s too many things to represent. It\u2019s too diverse. I probably could only say I\u2019m representing the act of being really messy while seeking.\u201d For all its specificity, though, there is much that is universal about Ramy. \u201cThe amount of people I\u2019ve had come up to me who go, \u2018Dude, your family\u2019s just like my family in Ohio, or in Jamaica,\u2019 or, \u2018Your uncle [Naseem, who is a rabid antisemite] is just like my uncle, except he\u2019s Jewish and hates Muslims,\u2019\u201d says Youssef. \u201cThat stuff is everywhere. America is so diverse in its thinking, its liberalism and conservatism, and it\u2019s not really sectioned off to any area. Go 30 minutes out of any city, and you\u2019re gonna find what you think is really far from you.\u201d Still, he says, that doesn\u2019t stop anyone from \u201csectioning off\u201d groups of people on every scale, from supposedly crime-ridden neighbourhoods to Israel and Palestine. Many of Youssef\u2019s co-stars and crew have Palestinian roots, including Mohammed Amer (who was born in Kuwait to Palestinian parents), who plays one of his friends, and the Succession star Hiam Abbass, who plays his mother, who is French Palestinian. Or, indeed, Hadid, who has Palestinian Dutch heritage. \u201cI think a lot of people feel incredibly unsafe,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people have lost family, between our cast members and American friends who have family in Gaza.\u201d Youssef made an episode of Ramy\u2019s third season in Israel and Palestine in mid-2022, working with Palestinian actors and crew members. It was a politically tense time even then, he recalls. The Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Aqleh was shot and killed by Israeli forces while they were there \u2013 the entire production attended her funeral. In the resultant episode, though, the geopolitics are just a backdrop to Ramy\u2019s selfish mission to cross into East Jerusalem to hook up with a Tinder date, brandishing his American passport at border security to try to jump the queue. \u201cThe Palestinians are pissed at him, the Israelis are pissed at him, and the other thing I really wanted to highlight was just his privilege as an American,\u201d says Youssef. \u201cI wanted to put a spotlight on dynamics that \u2026 obviously they pain me and I see something skewed, but at the same time, how do I link that to my own complicity with it? Because I think that\u2019s always the most interesting way to look at a problem: like, how do I shift this dynamic?\u201d This is what he\u2019s always seeking to do, he says: \u201cI always think about, how do we personalise these large, global things that feel like they\u2019re out of our hands? What government dynamics exist in my friendships and in my family?\u201d On a personal level, at least, everything seems to be going in the right direction for Youssef. When he was 17, he was taping flyers to lamp-posts to get people to come to his gigs; now he\u2019s the A-listers\u2019 hot ticket. His cultural reach is still expanding. As well as acting, he is shooting a second standup special for HBO, which is due out next year. Mo, the sitcom he co-created with Amer, has been renewed for a second season. He is also excited about an animated series he is making for Amazon with the South Park writer Pam Brady. It is called #1 Happy Family USA, and again, it is a comic take on a Muslim American family desperately trying to fit in in the early 00s. \u201cWhen we started making this show, I thought that I was examining the past; in the last couple of months, I\u2019ve started to feel like I\u2019m examining now.\u201d Reality comes crashing back into the conversation. After the horrific Hamas attacks last October, Islamophobia is almost worse than it was post-9/11, Youssef says. He finds it shocking \u201cthe way that people are so quick to dehumanise and vilify and think the worst of Arab men \u2013 what they think they can do to other people and what they think they do to Arab women. And the way that people can look at people who, especially in societies like London or America, are your neighbours, they\u2019re your doctors, they\u2019re serving you food, they\u2019ve been next to you, side by side. But you\u2019re ready to believe almost anything about them. I\u2019m surprised and I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d But he refuses to give in to despair. \u201cI\u2019m such an optimist,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that there has been this kind of reaction right now: everyone\u2019s feeling really hurt, horrible things have happened to innocent people and it has created this shocked nervous-system response. I trust that we\u2019re still going to be able to look each other in the eye and have real, grounded conversations that are not fully rooted in fear. And I think that\u2019s where art comes in, because it helps cut through fear.\u201d \u2022 Poor Things is released in cinemas in the UK and Ireland from Friday 12 January \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "body": "After giving birth, Vanessa Chisakula started writing poetry as a way of processing the changes and struggles she was experiencing as a new mother. \u201cI was in my early 20s. I had just become a mum and didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d she says. \u201cI had all these questions,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat is a woman? Is this it? I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to be doing.\u201d With poetry, she adds, \u201cyou can say a lot of things and it\u2019s so therapeutic\u201d. Just writing poems was not enough, however. Chisakula wanted to share her stories. She was inspired to do spoken-word poetry \u2013 a genre written to be read out loud and performed \u2013 when she heard I Will Wait For You by Janette\u2026ikz, an American spoken-word poet. Now, she is spearheading efforts to expand the spoken-word scene in Zambia, where she is from. In 2017, she co-founded Word Smash Poetry, a movement for young creative activists across southern Africa. In her own award-winning work, she uses poetry as a tool for activism, focusing on issues including women\u2019s rights, youth, African identity and mental health. \u201cI believe in the beautiful persuasion that art brings to the table,\u201d she says. \u201cArt is a form of protest that leaves no blood. It can be peacefully done but a strong message can be communicated artistically.\u201d Chisakula grew up in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, where she still lives with her two children. Her interest in writing started when she watched the film Titanic as a child. Her dream was to produce screenplays and she had never considered poetry until a friend suggested she give it a go. She has not looked back since. \u201cPoetry is just so beautiful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be a short but inspiring piece; it leaves you thinking and wanting more. I didn\u2019t want to stop.\u201d One of her first poems, Her Place, was an examination of womanhood. She explains: \u201cI wanted to tell my truth. What exactly is womanhood? How am I defining it? What are the things that are not working around it?\u201d In it, she says: \u201cHer place was not of a sex symbol, bed-warmer, a stress reliever or a horny man\u2019s entertainer. And her body was not a museum of statues for show because everything she carried in her body were interconnected parts and inside of her there lived a heart. But they could not realise that and they asked about her place. Her place is on top.\u201d In 2020, Chisakula released a short collection of poems, Africana, written to embrace her identity as a black African. \u201cI always wanted to relocate to the US when I was young,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought the American dream was the dream. There\u2019s no African dream.\u201d She no longer believes this; now she wants to celebrate her home continent. When she was younger, she was made to feel inferior when peers called her skin \u201ctoo dark\u201d; at college she was called \u201cblackie\u201d. She blames colonialism for engendering an inferiority complex among black Africans in Africa. \u201cSome Africans haven\u2019t realised we\u2019re dealing with it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to accept your own self is good enough if somebody has convinced you that it\u2019s not.\u201d Over the past five years, Chisakula has seen the spoken-word scene grow in popularity in her home country. It is already well established across southern Africa, she says. From September to December there are poetry festivals \u201cnonstop\u201d across countries including South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia. In 2022, the winner of the World Poetry Slam, held in Brussels, was Xabiso Vili from South Africa. This year, the competition will be held in Togo. When she started working with the Word Smash Poetry movement, she was aware of about five poetry organisations. \u201cThere\u2019s a poet on every corner now,\u201d she says. \u201cBack then, it was a bit uncommon; now people are doing it on a larger scale. I see poets at almost every event.\u201d Male poets still outnumber female poets, however. Chisakula believes women struggle to get a foothold in the arts in Zambia. She says: \u201cWomen and girls still shy away from these spaces, they don\u2019t participate as easily.\u201d Last month, the Word Smash Poetry movement hosted its second all-female national poetry slam in Lusaka, which took place during the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence, an annual international campaign that kicks off in late November. There were 12 performers in total; four had returned after performing last year and there were eight new faces, which was a huge achievement, according to Chisakula. The quality of the performances during the slam was also impressive. \u201cThe girls were able to express themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cThe stories were well put; they were loud; they were clear. They had solutions. They were captivating. I\u2019m glad we managed to put that space there to allow a celebration of our stories.\u201d",

        "body": "Amazon faces fresh industrial action in the UK, after members of the GMB union at a new fulfilment centre in Birmingham voted to strike over pay and conditions later this month. The GMB says \u201cup to 100\u201d workers will take part in the strike at the warehouse, which opened in October \u2013 a small fraction of the total workforce \u2013 but it hopes to use the action to boost the profile of the dispute and recruit more supporters. GMB members at the site have chosen 25 January as their first strike day, exactly one year after a stoppage by workers at Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse, in what was the first action of its kind against the company in the UK. Rachel Fagan, a local GMB organiser, said: \u201cThe industrial chaos Amazon faces isn\u2019t going to disappear; it\u2019s growing every day. One year on from the first strike day the message from GMB members at Amazon is the same: recognise our union and end poverty pay.\u201d Membership in Coventry has increased significantly since that first strike, to more than 1,200, according to the GMB, which has also secured a mandate for industrial action at a site in Rugeley, Staffordshire. The GMB had hoped to win formal recognition in Coventry, but withdrew its application after the regulator, the central arbitration committee, backed Amazon\u2019s claim that the workforce had swelled to 2,700. At the time, the union accused Amazon of drafting in more than 1,000 new workers to skew the decision. The company insisted any new recruitment was due to the demands of the business. Amazon staff in Coventry have taken 28 days of industrial action since the start of last year, culminating in a Black Friday rally in November at which they were joined by fellow Amazon workers from Italy, Germany and the US. The basic rate of pay has increased several times over that period and is due to rise to \u00a312.30 an hour in April, although that falls well short of the \u00a315 an hour the strikers are demanding. Amazon denies the increases have any link with the industrial action, insisting it has always reviewed pay regularly. An Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cJust 19 GMB members out of our 2,000 Sutton Coldfield fulfilment centre colleagues have voted in favour of industrial action. It will cause zero disruption for our customers. \u201cWe regularly review our pay to ensure we offer competitive wages and benefits. We also work hard to provide great benefits, a positive work environment and excellent career opportunities.\u201d",

        "body": "Gas drilling at a site in the Surrey Hills can go ahead after the court of appeal ruled that no further attempts to stop the project could be brought to court. The Loxley site, just outside the village of Dunsfold, has been at the centre of a protracted legal battle over plans by the energy company UK Oil and Gas (Ukog) to sink an exploration well. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has faced criticism after being accused of not sufficiently opposing the scheme since taking his cabinet position. Before becoming chancellor, Hunt had previously said the drilling would \u201ccreate enormous disruption and environmental damage for little if any economic benefit\u201d, and attended protests against the scheme. However, since being appointed to cabinet he has remained quiet. A source close to Hunt said he could not comment on cases subject to judicial review as a government minister, but that his views on the project as a constituency MP are a matter of public record. After the decision, Hunt tweeted: \u201cI am bitterly disappointed to learn that the court of appeal has today refused permission for any further appeal against the Ukog planning consent for the Loxley gas well outside Dunsfold. I stand ready to provide my assistance and support to local communities in any way possible going forwards.\u201d Hunt is under pressure from the Liberal Democrats in his South West Surrey constituency, where he has a majority of 8,000. The local environmental issue has angered many of his constituents, who have complained about the noise and environmental impacts of drilling for gas near the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty. The Liberal Democrats environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: \u201cThis is a shameful outcome. This Conservative government\u2019s policies have resulted in greedy gas barons ripping up the Surrey Hills. They have railroaded this through the courts despite local outrage at the plans. \u201cSurrey\u2019s green land is about to be torn up, proving you simply can\u2019t trust the Conservatives on the environment. As the local MP, Jeremy Hunt must now intervene. He is supporting a policy which will allow his constituency to become an oilfield. Local people will be furious at his silence.\u201d Stephen Sanderson, Ukog\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe are pleased that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has once again dismissed the legal challenge to our Loxley project and has confirmed that its planning consent is entirely lawful, as the company and its counsel has maintained. We believe that a successful project will be beneficial to local and national level energy and economic interests and is fully in keeping with the government\u2019s hydrogen, energy security and net zero strategies.\u201d",

        "body": "Elly Conway\u2019s debut novel, Argylle (Bantam Press), comes weighted with great expectations. It\u2019s being adapted for the cinema by director Matthew Vaughn, who calls it the start of \u201cthe most incredible and original spy franchise since Ian Fleming\u2019s books\u201d. There are all sorts of fun mysteries about Conway herself: who is this secretive author? (One rumour links her to Taylor Swift, which seems unlikely.) The title\u2019s protagonist is young and handsome Aubrey Argylle, who is chilling in Thailand when he sees a plane go down over the jungle and stages a daring rescue. His actions bring him to the attention of the CIA and he\u2019s recruited for a deadly mission. Two things you need to know: as Argylle was raised by nomadic, drug dealer parents, he is fluent in all sorts of languages and brilliant at martial arts. His mission: to stop a supervillain Russian from getting his hands on \u201ca priceless treasure of unrivalled opulence\u201d stolen by the Nazis \u2013 the recovery of which would make him the most powerful man in the world. It\u2019s all hugely melodramatic, rather silly and very entertaining, particularly when Argylle\u2019s training for the mission steps up and he\u2019s sent to places such as Monte Carlo (where \u201cthe most famous lighting choreographer in the world\u201d awaits) and remote Greek monasteries (\u201ca seemingly impossible feat of perseverance and engineering\u201d). Heir to Fleming is pushing it \u2013 I was outraged when, undercover in Monte Carlo after weeks of training under false identities, Argylle and his partner refer to each other by their real names. Did Conway write this while \u201cworking as a waitress in a late-night diner\u201d, as her author blurb says? Or did it come to her \u201cin a febrile dream\u201d while recuperating from an accident, as her author\u2019s note has it? I can\u2019t say, but be prepared: the hype is going to be big. I love a good unreliable narrator story, and Araminta Hall\u2019s One of the Good Guys (Macmillan) is among the best I\u2019ve read in ages. It starts from the perspective of Cole, who has moved to the coast after his marriage ended. He\u2019s heartbroken to have lost Mel, and is trying to make a fresh start without her. He\u2019s caring and thoughtful, one of the good guys, and we, and Cole\u2019s new friend, Lennie, a reclusive artist, hear all about how Mel hurt him as the story progresses. \u201cI want nothing more than to support and empower women, but surely that doesn\u2019t mean that I should lie on the floor and let them walk all over me,\u201d he muses. And: \u201cI know, historically, it\u2019s been hard to be a woman but, my God, it\u2019s hard to be a man right now.\u201d We also learn of the two young women who have been walking the coastline as part of a protest about male violence; we see their confrontation with Cole as he tries to keep them safe. Hall is fantastically good at upending expectations and pulling the wool over her readers\u2019 eyes, so I can\u2019t say much more without giving things away \u2013 but this exploration of female rage isn\u2019t what you think it\u2019s going to be. In Ashley Elston\u2019s First Lie Wins (Headline), we are introduced to Evie Porter as she\u2019s meeting new boyfriend Ryan\u2019s circle of friends and being relentlessly quizzed about her life. We quickly learn that this isn\u2019t such a bad idea: Evie isn\u2019t who she seems. She\u2019s engineered her way into Ryan\u2019s life after her boss, the mysterious Mr Smith, makes Ryan her latest target. But then she meets a woman at a party who appears to have taken on Evie\u2019s real identity, and she begins to realise her boss might be playing her. Elston moves the story back and forth in time, allowing us to see how Evie fell into her life of crime, and watch as her past starts to catch up with her. This is twisty and fast-paced, and Evie is an enjoyably skilful operator. The Alaskan wilds are the setting for Marie Vingtras\u2019s compelling Blizzard (Mountain Leopard Press), ably translated from the French by Stephanie Smee. Bess, the nanny, has stepped out into a snowstorm with the young boy in her charge; she lets go of his hand and loses him. \u201cI can\u2019t see a thing. The snow\u2019s whipping up from the ground in swirling gusts and if I look up to the sky, it\u2019s a total white out. The air itself has been leached of colour, as if every shade has faded away, as if the whole world has been diluted in a glass of water.\u201d The few neighbours in this remote location brave the blizzard to help look for him; Vingtras tells each of her short chapters from their various perspectives, slowly revealing the secrets they all hold as the desperate search goes on. Winner of the French Booksellers award, it is a chilling, tense read. \u2022 To order Argylle, One of the Good Guys, First Lie Wins or Blizzard click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com.

        "body": "People with disability working in supported employment are being legally paid less superannuation than the rest of the workforce due to outdated and contradictory workplace laws, an inequity for which advocates say there is \u201cno excuse\u201d. Under the federal superannuation guarantee, companies must pay all adult employees a super contribution of 11% of their ordinary wage. But under the supported employment services award 2020, employees with disability working in supported employment are entitled to only 9.5%, or $15 a week, whichever is greater. The lower rate of superannuation is on top of laws that already allow Australian disability enterprises (ADEs) to pay their staff vastly below the minimum wage, sometimes as low as $2.90 an hour. The national minimum wage is $23.23 an hour. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Supported employment, or ADEs, are programs in which people with disability work in a segregated environment under supervision. The award covers approximately 20,000 people. ADEs calculate a wage for a person with a disability based on an assessment of their productivity and competencies, or by reference to what is called the special national minimum wage. The last update to the superannuation rate for people with disability specified in the award was on 1 January 2021. The superannuation guarantee has been updated three times since then, at 0.5% each time. Super rates under the guarantee are scheduled to continue increasing for the next two years until they reach 12% in 2025. Guardian Australia has seen evidence that Orana, a major disability employment provider in South Australia with approximately 450 employees in supported employment, has been calculating superannuation for its employees with disabilities at the 9.5% rate based on the specification in the award. Supported employment roles at Orana include gardening and landscaping, customer service, industrial sewing, packing and assembly. Orana has been approached for comment. David Kirner from the Construction, Forestry and Maritime Employees Union in South Australia, said it was an example of how an outdated award was causing problems for people who were already marginalised and vulnerable. Kirner said the likelihood of wage theft increased substantially when the award contained incorrect or outdated information. \u201cThere\u2019s been a royal commission into the rights of people with a disability but you still have a modern award that says you\u2019ll still get 9.5% superannuation when everyone else gets 11% because nobody\u2019s updated it since 2021,\u201d Kirner said. Before 2019, low-income workers with a disability under the supported employment services award received just 3% superannuation, or a minimum of $6 a week. A campaign from the United Workers\u2019 Union resulted in the Fair Work Commission changing the rate to 9.5% \u2013 equivalent to the mainstream guarantee at the time \u2013 or $15 a week. Catherine McAlpine, chief executive of Inclusion Australia, said the incongruity between the award and the national guarantee was the sort of inequity and oversight that people with disability had come to expect. \u201cThere is absolutely no excuse to not pay people with an intellectual disability the same rate of superannuation as every other employee in the country,\u201d McAlpine said. \u201cPeople with intellectual disability are very clear that they are not respected as employees and that lack of respect is reflected in the very poor wages that they are paid.\u201d In the final report of the disability royal commission, handed down in October last year, four of the seven commissioners recommended the phase-out of disability enterprises and elimination of subminimum wages for people with disability by 2034. Inclusion Australia advocated to the commission for a non-segregated employment support system that gave people with disability ordinary award wages, access to all employment services, and a refocusing of disability enterprises. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we make the changes to better wages carefully to make sure that people with really high support needs don\u2019t lose either their existing job or the opportunity to be employed,\u201d McAlpine said.

        "body": "Realistically, there are only two reasons anyone would ever want to listen to a podcast named The Queen\u2019s Reading Room. The first is that they really like reading. The second \u2013 and I can tell you\u2019re already way ahead of me here \u2013 is that they really like the Queen. So it brings me nothing but dismay to inform you that a full 50% of The Queen\u2019s Reading Room listeners are doomed to come away from the endeavour feeling bitterly disappointed. The Queen\u2019s Reading Room is the podcast offshoot of Queen Camilla\u2019s charity-slash-bookclub where she recommends books for her loyal subjects to read (titles thus far have included Frankenstein, Lessons in Chemistry \u2013 and The Year of Eating Dangerously by an obscure young up-and-comer by the name of Tom Parker Bowles). The thought of expanding this pursuit into podcasts seems like a natural one, since hearing the Queen discuss her favourite books at length \u2013 perhaps with people whose backgrounds would help to challenge her interpretations \u2013 would surely be the ideal way to humanise an aloof and out-of-touch monarchy. Well, tough luck. That isn\u2019t what The Queen\u2019s Reading Room is at all. Instead, it is a deeply generic author interview podcast where Camilla sort of pops up at the end to tersely announce that she quite likes Harry Potter but refuses to do the voices, before rapidly retreating in a cloud of cigarette smoke and gin fumes. In other words, this isn\u2019t the sort of thing you\u2019d listen to if you wanted to learn anything about the Queen at all. The first episode belongs to Sir Ian Rankin, who gamely spends 20 minutes answering a number of slightly nondescript questions about his favourite books. The podcast\u2019s weird format means that all the actual questions have been edited out of the audio, which gives the impression that Rankin has been forced to directionlessly free-associate about himself under literal pain of death. He was on the You\u2019re Booked podcast in October with an actual, flesh and blood interviewer, and was infinitely more engaged and charming. The second episode is a little fizzier, by dint of the fact that its subject is Joanna Lumley. Less celebrated an author than Rankin (her published work includes three memoirs, two travel books and a \u201ccelebration of Queen Elizabeth II\u201d), she nevertheless comes across as excitable and conspiratorial, and often addresses the listeners directly during her entertainingly scatty sermons about the joys of reading for pleasure. Lumley is so good, in fact, that you find yourself wanting to stage a republican revolution to install her as the leader, so that she\u2019ll get to do this podcast instead of Camilla. What a waste of a potentially winning premise this is. Had Camilla gone in with both feet, the podcast still could have been a disaster, but at least it would have been an interesting one. Maybe if she could have recorded the opening introduction herself, rather than foisting it off on a lackey, the enterprise would have had a bit of personality. If she\u2019d have gone one better, and fully committed to the genre by doing intermittent blank-eyed sponsored ad reads for vitamin supplements and Amazon Prime Video, I might have been inclined to listen regularly. We\u2019re left with an immensely hollow feeling. There are already enough podcasts in the world, so the last thing we need is one by a woman who can\u2019t even be bothered to show up properly. And it\u2019s not like there was even a high bar to clear here. Before The Queen\u2019s Reading Room, the only member of the royal family putting literary content online was Sarah Ferguson, who liked to dress up and read children\u2019s books on YouTube. Her videos are like something filmed by a hostage to send coded messages to their family, but at least they have some personality. On the basis of its first two episodes, this is something that The Queen\u2019s Reading Room is never likely to achieve.",

        "body": "In every sense, Taylor Swift is an outlier. This week her Eras Tour film became the highest-grossing concert film in box office history, taking the record from Michael Jackson\u2019s 2009 movie This Is It. She was the only artist who placed in the chart of the UK\u2019s Top 10 albums of 2023 with a new album rather than an older one (albeit with a re-recording of her 2014 pop breakthrough 1989). Last year she became the first woman to have four albums in the US Top 10 at the same time, she took the record for the most US No 1 albums by a woman from Barbra Streisand, the Eras tour became the first ever to earn more than $1bn, and in October Swift herself was estimated to have become a billionaire. In November, a US publication hired a dedicated Swift reporter \u2013 though the joke is that everyone in entertainment media pretty much does the same job, given the wild scale of her success. But beyond commerce, Swift, 34, is also an outlier in terms of how she conducts her relationships with her fans and the public. She maintains an unusual level of control in a period when other pop superstars allow themselves to be the subjects of untrammelled interpretation and speculation \u2013 Harry Styles thrives on mystery; Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s PR strategy appears to be never apologise, never explain \u2013 and understand how doing so might satisfy unexpected elements of one\u2019s fanbase, or suggest surprisingly viable commercial paths. Swift rarely gives interviews \u2013 though more on that later \u2013 and her primary public relations strategy involves seeding fairly obvious clues for her fans to work out her next move, allowing them to feel like active participants in her work while almost always leading them to her desired conclusion. Puppet-mastery is a smart approach, especially for a star who tests the limits of overexposure \u2013 allowing her to remain plausibly out of the picture while perpetually in the spotlight and still on her terms. Occasionally, though, the velvet glove comes off and the tightness of the star\u2019s grip on her narrative becomes felt when people draw the \u201cwrong\u201d conclusions. Last week, the New York Times published a 5,000-word comment piece speculating that Swift is secretly gay \u2013 as deduced from various lyrics and costuming choices \u2013 and suggesting that she owes it to queer fans and less privileged musicians to come out. These notions are not news to the Swift hardcore, a significant number of whom identify as \u201cGaylor\u201d conspiracists, certain that she has dated women throughout her life. But fans gleefully cross-referencing lyrics and dates online \u2013 often seeking an affirmative reflection of their own desires \u2013 is one thing. A major global publication writing a prescriptive, even chastising, article seems both trivial and sinister \u2013 a good old-fashioned celebrity outing under the guise of social conscience, and one that unhelpfully essentialises sexuality to a behavioural code. And as a much better NYT comment piece on queerbaiting put it last year: \u201cAs self-serving as some celebrity caginess can be, you can\u2019t build a world in which everyone feels free to self-identify by ordering everyone to self-identify.\u201d Surprisingly, Swift\u2019s usually invisible team \u2013 or \u201ca person close to the situation\u201d, as CNN reported \u2013 hit back. \u201cBecause of her massive success, in this moment there is a Taylor-shaped hole in people\u2019s ethics,\u201d they told CNN. \u201cThis article wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans. There seems to be no boundary some journalists won\u2019t cross when writing about Taylor, regardless of how invasive, untrue and inappropriate it is \u2013 all under the protective veil of an \u2018opinion piece\u2019.\u201d The response felt almost as heavy-handed and misguided as the original piece. Male artists including Shawn Mendes and Harry Styles have in fact been the subjects of massive speculation about their sexualities: the NYT writer previously published a similar piece about Styles, while Mendes has spoken of the pressure of the constant discourse about his identity. (\u201cI thought, \u2018You fucking guys are so lucky I\u2019m not actually gay and terrified of coming out,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told Rolling Stone. \u201cThat\u2019s something that kills people.\u201d) And there is no way that gimlet-eyed Swift has made the many references listed by accident: if you lead a horse to water, don\u2019t be surprised when it drinks. Dignifying an overblown essay with such a severe response may in turn act as a rebuke to fans who have found identification and solace \u2013 or even just benign entertainment \u2013 in imagining, say, that Swift\u2019s gaspingly sexy Reputation song Dress may be about her once-prominent friend, the model Karlie Kloss (\u201cI don\u2019t want you like a best friend\u201d!), rather than its more likely subject, her then-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. More than ever, pop stardom is an act of collective imagination. Swift may be one of the last monocultural stars \u2013 meaning your grandparents may have a passing awareness of who she is; her moves make tabloid headlines, not just niche gossip items, and prompt bland (but hardly offensive) jokes at awards ceremonies \u2013 but that monoculture is still a federation of distinct fanbases, each with their own interpretation of her. Thanks to social media, members of each of these Swiftian sub-tribes can find each other and imagine and inhabit their own version of her reality, forming community (if sometimes descending into entitlement). The Swift I enjoy is a little vindictive and surprisingly self-lacerating; others may value her loyalty to her friends, her honesty about her experiences with disordered eating, her goofiness, her assiduous capitalist instincts, or may have found in her some other prism through which to understand and appreciate some aspect of their identity \u2013 all of them valid parasocial relationships. Arguably, what Swift serves up is a constructed fiction with herself as the central character: why shouldn\u2019t it compete with others? It\u2019s these playful and personal mutations that keep a star like Swift interesting at a time when her carefully managed media omnipresence and tightly plotted breadcrumb trails have started to feel a little tedious, laden with thudding predictability. (Does the snake-green dress she wore to the Golden Globes at the weekend mean that the serpent-referencing Reputation (Taylor\u2019s Version) is coming? Is the pope Catholic?) For many onlookers, that wearying feeling struck again when reading her lone recent interview, for Time\u2019s person of the year cover, which seemed disappointingly uninquiring and intent on validating her version of events \u2013 namely that she was \u201ccancelled\u201d in the wake of her feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, when in fact it resulted in one of the most successful albums of her career \u2013 rather than pushing deeper into the fertile ground where her self-conception rubs up against public interpretation. The most abiding images of Swift this past year show pop\u2019s biggest outlier standing alone on stage at the Eras tour, bedazzled with sequins. She cuts a formidable figure in her class of one \u2013 but it\u2019s in the unruly exquisite corpse of pop fandom and stardom that the most meaningful rewards are found.",

        "body": "As anyone who\u2019s seen the great TJ &amp; Dave at this venue can testify, a particular pleasure derives from watching veteran improvisers at work. The anxiety that can attend this art form falls away, in the company of artists fully in control of the flow of their impulses and off-the-cuff ideas. That\u2019s the case with this Chicago quartet, who arrive boasting Second City credentials, a founding role (alongside Amy Poehler) in the Upright Citizens Brigade, and TV credits including Veep, SNL and The Good Place. Their improvising touch is sure, then \u2013 even if the format isn\u2019t. They\u2019re here to \u201cbring long-form improv to the UK\u201d, they tell us, but what follows is suspended somewhere between sketch comedy and long-form as usually understood. Expats don\u2019t improvise a full-length story with a beginning, middle and end. They take themes and ideas from the audience, riff on them with recurring characters in loosely connected scenes \u2013 then reboot the process and start again. It\u2019s a format that tantalises then withholds the prospect of a narrative satisfaction, a uniting of all the disparate parts. Which \u2013 once you accept that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting \u2013 is fine. The quality of the performances, the vividness of the characters, the smoothness of the repartee \u2013 it\u2019s all so delectable, I still found myself chuckling from start to finish. Tonight, we get a hapless barfly beaten up for his views on the climate crisis, a motorist cruising a posh party seeking sponsors for his purchase of a Bentley, and a ghostly grandpa hijacking a house sale. That spectral visitation (played by first-among-equals Brad Morris) is greeted nonchalantly by the other performers on stage, which feels like a misstep. These grizzled veterans tend towards the sardonic, and, in improv terms, that can sometimes feel like blocking or lowering the stakes. There\u2019s a special guest each night, too, which, for all that Rich Fulcher\u2019s contribution was amusing enough, feels like a gimmicky add-on. No additions are required to this troupe of improv lifers, whose consummate interplay and keen but composed instinct for the funny deliver a substantial comic \u2013 if not narrative \u2013 payload. At Soho theatre, London, until 13 January",

        "body": "It is not so much a lawn as a moonscape: pitted craters dug by bandicoots, exhausted tufts of withered yellow grass plucked by wallabies and pitiful plants shrivelled brown under the Australian sunshine. But Kathleen Murray is the proud winner of the first World\u2019s Ugliest Lawn competition after the Swedish contest to encourage water-saving, environmentally-friendly gardening went global. Murray\u2019s lawn in Sandford, Tasmania, beat competition from parched grass patches in Germany, France, Canada, Croatia, Sweden, the US and the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty shock-and-awe,\u201d said Murray of her lawn. \u201cThe bandicoots love digging \u2013 that\u2019s how they find their favourite food. Now my back yard looks like a real-life Hungry Hungry Hippo game. I also have an echidna that helps, and some chooks.\u201d Murray lives in an area without mains water, and so rainwater collected in tanks is too precious to waste on the lawn. If she and her four teenage children run out of water in summer, it can be a two-week wait before more water is delivered via tanker. \u201cI used to think the bandicoots were wildlife of mass destruction invading my lawn, but now I see that they\u2019ve actually liberated me from ever having to mow it again,\u201d said Murray, who is the proud owner of the inaugural trophy \u2013 a commemorative T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019m all for guilt-free weekends, especially since my ex-husband left with the lawnmower back in 2016.\u201d The competition began in Gotland, Sweden, two years ago, after the popular holiday island came within hours of running out of water the previous summer. The contest, devised by the municipality of Gotland, became global news after the Guardian picked up the story. Water consumption in Gotland has fallen by 5% thanks to the competition and other measures. Mimmi Gibson of the municipality said: \u201cIt\u2019s a gentle way to nudge people into action and it automatically turns you into a climate hero by not doing anything. We need to start the conversation on how to save water. It\u2019s a global problem. Sometimes, there\u2019s pressure on people to keep their lawn really green and tidy and lush and it can be easier to say \u2018I\u2019m in this competition, I don\u2019t need to water my lawn.\u2019\u201d Murray previously shrugged off criticism of her lawn by calling it \u201ca paddock\u201d, or claiming she\u2019s waiting for the grass to grow so she can cut hay, but is now happy to talk about the biodiversity benefits of her laid-back gardening style. Blue-tongue lizards, kangaroos, wallabies and pademelons all visit from the neighbouring nature reserve. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to make my place an extension of the nature reserve because it is right beside it. That\u2019s another excuse for me not watering my lawn. Do you water Cradle Mountain? No. It just looks after itself. By and large, that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\u201d The jury took nearly two hours of deliberations to reach their verdict on the ugliest lawn. \u201cAll of them were hideous and well worthy of winning but the winning entry was really, really bad,\u201d said Gibson. Diarmuid Gavin, the garden designer and broadcaster who was also a member of the jury, said it was the weirdest competition he had been asked to judge but he hoped it would encourage people to ditch old attachments to green lawns and create climate-appropriate gardens. \u201cSeeing a lawn in Tasmania like this, wondering why there\u2019s a prize for the world\u2019s worst lawn, really makes people think but with that sense of humour, without lecturing or hectoring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Tasmanian garden was soulful because it had an understanding of what\u2019s happening. If we\u2019re lucky enough to look after a piece of land, we all need to be thinking gardeners now. The moral imperative isn\u2019t so much to fit in, or not let the neighbourhood down, it\u2019s to not let the planet down.\u201d Murray added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a choice to make \u2013 do you want farmers to have enough water to produce food for a growing human population or do you want to play some type of lawn nazi competition with your neighbours to make them jealous of how green your lawn is?\u201d \u201cIt brings me a lot of joy to see all the little creatures who now feel safe to come out during the day in my back yard \u2013 they\u2019ve got camouflage, they have happy digging areas. It really enhances my feeling of inner peace knowing that I\u2019m playing a microscopic part to help other things.\u201d",

        "body": "Noel Gallagher recently stated that Super Furry Animals were the best band to come out of Wales. Do you have any wild stories from the 90s involving Oasis or other Creation Records\u2019 bands? RobJ1982 Plenty of wild stories! We were in an incredible situation, where we grew up listening to records on Creation as teenagers and then got signed by the label. I pinched myself many times. Oasis took us on tour and were generally really warm and generous to us. We had front row seats for some of the madness. When we played the Etihad Stadium with them, they generously gave us the Manchester City home dressing room. One of our guitar techs who supports a rival team claimed to have left tiny messages for the City players all over it \u2013 the lockers, the showers, everything. I can only imagine the scenes when they came face to face with all these sarky comments. What happened to the tank? qwertychucha They were confiscating sound systems after the criminal justice bill [became law], so we put ours in a tank. Tanks are illegal on highways, so we had to pull in favours to park it in fields. When we took it to the [1996] Reading festival on a lorry, we got all these complaints, because it was louder than the second stage. In the end, we sold it to Don Henley from the Eagles, who collects military vehicles. He had no interest in the band and I think had the SFA logo repainted in military colours. We were hoping to have a festival on an aircraft carrier and such, but to do that we needed a platinum\u2011selling album. We met backstage at Victorious festival in 2015. Now that we are best mates, can I use my influence to persuade you and the Super Furry Animals boys to record a 10th album? Maff78 It\u2019s a decimal culture, but through no planning we only managed nine, which seems to be a friendly number for the 21st century. They fit really well on a Rubik\u2019s Cube. I\u2019d never say never, but there are no plans. We last reunited for a tour for the reissue of Mwng [in 2015], which was very enjoyable, but if you let it get out of hand you end up reliving the past in real time, which would be a very strange existence. Eight years ago, you wrote a song about Brexit [I Love EU]. How have you found the time since? Hussar It was a yes-or-no referendum and the outcomes we\u2019re seeing now were all predicted. My sense was that the parameters for Brexit were all going to be set by the right wing. Although I\u2019ve got a lot of time for leftwing arguments about leaving the EU, travelling around Europe was a nightmare before the Maastricht treaty and we\u2019re back to that. I like Noam Chomsky\u2019s take that both in and out are pretty bad situations, but if you\u2019re offered two evils then you go for the lesser one every time. The excellent song Bad Friend on your new album, Sadness Sets Me Free, refers to a caravan holiday on the western edge of Wales, where \u201cit was raining, the beer was warm and the chips were wet\u201d. Is the lyric based on real experience? VerulamiumParkRanger Every holiday I\u2019ve had, more or less. But the song is about how you can only take a caravan-load with you, or if you\u2019ve got a five-a-side football team only five can play. It\u2019s about the pressure of not being able to be there for everyone everywhere all the time. I wrote the song in 2022, but only learned the word \u201ccapacity\u201d in 2023, which would have explained it much more simply. Could there ever be a Euros Childs/Gruff Rhys collaboration? And do you agree he is one of the greats from the Welsh music scene? Peeby7 I agree, he\u2019s one of the greats. I first heard Gorky\u2019s Zygotic Mynci on Welsh language radio in 1990. We\u2019ve played gigs together over the years, then about two years ago I was in a supergroup with Euros on Welsh language TV. We ended up jamming with the Welsh band Adwaith for 30 minutes, but it was never recorded. It\u2019s probably still echoing in space. Your Edinburgh fringe show a few years ago demonstrated an incredible talent for deadpan comedy. Is that an experience you\u2019d like to revisit? DefinitelyStillAlive I did a slideshow tour for the album American Interior and got offered a week of gigs in Edinburgh. I\u2019ve got no interest in comedy, really. It was harrowing; all the posters with comedians staring out of them were really scary. They\u2019re all there for a month. I felt really bad for them. It\u2019s brutal. I enjoyed playing in one place, sometimes twice a day, but they didn\u2019t ask me back. Having written Neon Neon\u2019s Stainless Style album in honour of the DeLorean, which of the vehicle\u2019s most famous drivers are you more like: Marty McFly (resourceful, family-oriented, success-driven) or Dr Emmett Brown (dreamer, creative, a sponge for new experiences)? McScootikins Emmett Brown sounds like a more interesting place to be, but I think maybe I\u2019m just the car itself, just the vehicle for the songs. The wild thing about songwriting is that it makes things happen. We did gigs with all these DeLoreans parked outside, people giving us lifts in them, even DeLoreans racing down Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. Do you remember the SFA gig at Somerset House? You played a DJ set at Corsica Studios afterwards. There were face masks of Dickie Davies on the ceiling. ginger-nick I think it was my 38th birthday [it was his 39th]. I\u2019ve got no memory of Dickie Davies face masks, but Andy Votel played the DJ set. It was so loud that it blew my friend\u2019s ears. He\u2019s still got tinnitus, 15 years later. What was it like recording Superfast Jellyfish for Gorillaz? Are the rumours true that you secretly appear on more tracks? FurryVision8000 Damon Albarn had the bassline and he got me and a drummer to jam with him until he felt there was something happening. The next time I heard it, De La Soul were rapping on it. I\u2019d bought their records as a teenager, so it was unbelievable. Then we did gigs where Mick Jones and Paul Simonon from the Clash were the guitarist and bass player and De La Soul were in the band. It was a surreal experience \u2013 incredible, really. Damon recorded a choir for the whole Plastic Beach album and I was in that choir, so I\u2019m probably on a lot of songs. I always regret never buying an SFA-sponsored Cardiff City football shirt from the 1999/00 season. However, with you being a Bangor City fan, why was it Cardiff you sponsored and not your beloved Citizens? Alsithee When I moved from Bangor in north Wales to Cardiff in the south, to make my fortune, or something, with Super Furry Animals \u2013 I\u2019m still trying! \u2013 there was a contingent of Bangor fans who supported Cardiff: the Bangor City Bluebirds. So I didn\u2019t feel conflicted. Bangor were bankrupted and I\u2019m a Cardiff season ticket holder now. In the late 90s, there was this guy who was buying cheap ice hockey shirts from Egypt and convincing football teams that there were football shirts. So the Super Furry Animals Cardiff City shirt was actually an ice hockey shirt. We could only afford to sponsor them for the Welsh Cup. The chairman made a speech about the \u201cfive-figure deal\u201d, but in reality it only cost us \u00a32,000. Mwng is my favourite SFA album, despite me not understanding Welsh. Does singing in Welsh makes your songwriting easier? Flash bleu It\u2019s my first language, but my favourite melodies are the ones that come with words attached, so if they come in either language I won\u2019t change them. I\u2019m surprised I\u2019ve made so many English-language albums, but I\u2019ll always do Welsh-language ones. People ask me if I dream in Welsh and I\u2019m like: \u201cI don\u2019t think language is anywhere near my dreams. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in them!\u201d Would you represent the UK at the 2025 Eurovision song contest? VerulamiumParkRanger I\u2019d maybe do it for an independent Wales, although music is meant to transcend borders. Maybe I could represent a country from eastern Europe, although their choreography is far superior to mine. \u2022 Gruff Rhys\u2019s new album, Sadness Sets Me Free, is released on 26 January on Rough Trade",

        "body": "Whether it\u2019s down to brilliant marketing, an abundance of viral moments, or sheer film-making talent, there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that nearly two months after its initial release, Saltburn has become the must-see film of the moment. It was Prime Video\u2019s No 1 film over Christmas, featured song Murder on the Dancefloor is back in the charts, and TikTok appears to have gone beserk. Saltburn\u2019s route to this is relatively unorthodox. A glamorous, Brideshead-style period film, with an Oscar-winning writer-director in the chair and a name-droppable cast including Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike and Jacob Elordi, Saltburn\u2019s entry into the world was relatively gentle. Far from an effects-laden blockbuster with proven audience-attractors, a film like this would aim to be hosed down with admiring reviews, and find itself positioned for a significant awards run. In the event, reviews were far from unanimous, particularly in the UK: the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called it \u201cwatchable but sometimes weirdly overheated and grandiose\u201d, while the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Robbie Collin applauded its \u201csheer, nude-bungee-jumping-level fearlessness\u201d. Saltburn was swiftly labelled the \u201cmost divisive film of the year\u201d. A high-profile festival run, including a world premiere at the Telluride festival (which has previously acted as a launchpad for 12 Years a Slave, Moonlight and Belfast), led to a modest initial cinema release, never reaching higher than No 8 in the North American box office chart, and currently standing at a respectable $20.6m in worldwide takings. One statistic, however, may be a pointer to things to come: its box office takings held up remarkably well in its third week, declining by 9.3%, an impressive result in an environment where films normally drop high double-digits each week. Word of mouth, in retrospect, must have been strong. And, in the digital age, that is no longer an invisible weapon. Saltburn\u2019s powerful online game \u2013 crossing TikTok, Spotify, Letterboxd and all points in between \u2013 appears to be a juggernaut, with Deadline reporting that Saltburn-related videos have recorded 4bn views on TikTok alone. Writer-director Emerald Fennell\u2019s eye for viral moments \u2013 the bath, the grave, the dance \u2013 would appear to mesh fully with this non-traditional method of getting eyeballs on her film. Saltburn isn\u2019t yet achieving the same awards-related critical mass as Fennell\u2019s debut, Promising Young Woman. It missed out entirely at the Screen Actors Guild awards and scored only two nominations at the Golden Globes. Yet momentum can gather and awards season can swing. Saltburn may be the latest example of the critic-proof movie, though far from the one that depends on an action-star or comic-book fanbase to rack up the revenue. Saltburn has come from the opposite direction: an awards movie that has compensated for any brickbats with a flattering ability to pique a digital-oriented audience. A Brideshead for the TikTok generation? There are worse epitaphs.",

        "body": "Jon Ransom is a Cambridge-based, Norfolk-raised writer whose masterly debut The Whale Tattoo last year earned him the Polari first book prize. A raw and gritty novel of gay love, grief and resilience, it focused on Joe Gunner, a working-class young man stalked by visions, revenants and enemies. The narrative flitted between past and present, cut with periodic interludes where a river speaks to Joe, sometimes teasingly, sometimes pugnaciously. The novel swarmed with enigmas but eschewed easy answers: \u201cWay we put meaning on the things that happen to us \u2026 We make shit up \u2013 to make sense of it.\u201d Ransom has now written a hypnotic and even more mysterious second novel, The Gallopers. This is a lust-drenched, ache-filled gay love triangle of sorts that gnarls into a sly emotional thriller. The action begins in 1953 Norfolk, shortly after the North Sea flood. The narrator is 19-year-old Eli Stone, whose mother, Eliza, is believed to have been washed away. Eli lives with his aunt Dreama next to a cursed piece of land that exerts an uncanny force on them, and keeps the townspeople at a superstitious distance. When the flood came, \u201cwater rushed across the county displacing everything\u201d, save their field. Eli is enthralled with Jimmy Smart, the handsome and obliging fairground worker who rooms up at their barn. One night, not long after they first meet, Eli finds himself masturbating to the sight of the man washing himself off in the open. One of the central themes in The Gallopers is the occult machinery of desire: its blinding intensity and crippling sway on the mind and the body. \u201cDesire is cunning like that,\u201d Eli repeatedly thinks. Being in the company of Jimmy, Eli tells us, \u201cinterferes with everything, like the hairs on my arm during a thunderstorm\u201d. Ransom orchestrates some truly ravishing moments between the two men, tableaux roiling with heat, tenderness and poetry. Jimmy and Eli swim in the nude at night, soap each other\u2019s backs, share cigarettes in wordless pleasure. They dance by a bonfire, Jimmy \u201ccommuning with the flames\u201d, \u201chis gaze more mysterious beneath the moonlight. As though he might tip his head and howl.\u201d The other man in Eli\u2019s life is Shane Wright, his co-worker at a print shop. A gruff, boorish figure \u201cfilled up with tragedy\u201d, Shane dreams of going to America where he hopes to make a career in fitness modeling. Sex and a whiff of scandal tie him and Eli in an uneasy partnership, and later, when a girl from their neighbourhood goes missing and trouble comes sniffing for Shane, he calls on Eli for help. The Gallopers is a whispered howl of a novel about men fettered by masculine norms, the ideas and pressures that curtail their freedom, and the bargains they strike with others and themselves in order to live. The novel is excellent on queer love and the shape it takes once it mixes with shame, blood and guilt. Some of its best and most poignant passages capture the ghoulish discord between queerness and the law, the individual and the world, truth and deceit. As in Ransom\u2019s debut, homophobia and misogyny are the twin evils. Eli is bullied and chastised for his effeminacy; he longs, as a result, to flee, to rid himself of his \u201csissy mouth\u201d. Throughout the book, a steady volley of stones flies through the windows of Eli\u2019s room, collecting at the foot of his bed: grim tokens, he believes, of the townspeople\u2019s disapproval. Women similarly suffer the casual violence of men. They are \u201cdisappeared\u201d and later found traumatised, defiled or rotting deep in the ground. At the centre of the story lies a one-act play titled The Gallopers. Written by Eli three decades on and presented as a playscript, it reprises the themes of the novel at a slanted angle, recasting Eliza, Dreama and Shane in new roles. Shane appears as a version of Eli, grappling with his queerness, ready to take flight. Dreama, here Shane\u2019s mother, is seen fretting over a misplaced photo album, while Eliza, who is dying of Aids, digs for an unexploded second world war bomb in the field outside their house. Jimmy is a silent character; a showman invoked a few times by name and the fairground music that is part of the stage directions. Does the play hold the keys to the novel? Does it bring nuance, or add to our reading of the rest of the book? I\u2019m unsure. The novel proper ends in 1954, with Eli leaving for national service. What the play might mean, beyond an older Eli\u2019s attempt to fictionalise his life, while wrestling with ideas of loss, sickness and mortality, is up to the reader to decide. But at its best, The Gallopers offers a surprising and quietly devastating account of three men, and their troubled relationship with themselves and the world they live in. \u2022 The Gallopers by Jon Ransom is published by Muswell Press (\u00a314.99).

        "body": "Top of the new year to you all. The 24-hour news cycle is still wiping the sleep from its eyes but the world continues to deliver amazing stories: I can\u2019t get enough of the world\u2019s oldest cat and the world\u2019s tidiest mouse. The great reads are also flowing freely. If you haven\u2019t had your first coffee of the weekend yet, maybe take a sip below first for some inspiration. 1. The miracle of coffee The journey of coffee from plant to cup is so complex its discovery surely ranks alongside humanity\u2019s greatest achievements. Bianca Nogrady investigates the \u201csimultaneously fascinating and illuminating\u201d hard science behind the brewed concoction \u2013 and convinces an expert barista to share her secrets. Bean me up: A study published last month likened the physics of coffee grinding to what takes place on a moon of Saturn. How long will it take to read: Four minutes. Further reading: Our supermarket vegan milk taste test decides there is one soy to rule them all. 2. \u2018I had traded my sanity for milk\u2019 By the third day of breastfeeding her firstborn, Sirin Kale\u2019s nipples were bleeding. On the fifth day, her maternity support worker assured her it would get easier. So she pushed through, until at six weeks she was diagnosed with thrush. Sirin\u2019s story has a happy ending, but the debate continues: is breastfeeding or formula milk best? And why is a new mother\u2019s mental health not top priority? Sirin\u2019s breastfeeding advice: \u201cIt is absolutely fine to stop, or never start.\u201d How long will it take to read: Six minutes. 3. The effortlessly awesome Willem Dafoe He\u2019s played Jesus Christ and a memorable Spider-Man villain, plus added his dependable brand of gravitas to low-budget Australian films (Daybreakers and The Hunter). Willem Dafoe is also a hell of an interview subject, as Rebecca Nelson learned while the US actor was on the promotional trail for Poor Things. \u201cWith sheep and goats, some you know well, some have names and they really stick, but some are just sheep and goats. But every alpaca, you have a whole particular relationship with, and you know their character.\u201d \u2013 Willem Dafoe, hobby farmer and animal whisperer. How long will it take to read: Six minutes. Less if you just want to see the photoshoot. Further reading: Get your celebrity interviews here: Jodie Foster, Ramy Youssef, and Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone on Killers of the Flower Moon. 4. NZ\u2019s photographic history saved from landfill When LA-based gallery owner Duncan Miller hand-delivered more than 5,000 historic photos of M\u0101ori people to Wellington in 2023 he described it as an \u201cemotional\u201d homecoming. The story of how the Fairfax Media archive \u2013 featuring photos from Sir Edmund Hillary at the summit of Mount Everest to the 1969 W\u0101hine ferry disaster \u2013 found its way into his possession is as incredible as the images. Why is there no photo preview? The pics in this collection are so special we only have permission to use them once. What are you waiting for? How long will it take to read: Two minutes. 5. Why the cost-of-living crisis isn\u2019t about the price of groceries \u201cCossie livs\u201d is already front and centre of the Australian political discourse in 2024, with inflation falling further than expected (good) and supermarkets accused of price gouging (bad). Not that the latter is necessarily the root cause of the crisis. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the cost of buying goods, but whether our income is sufficient to pay for those goods,\u201d the economist John Quiggin writes. And income in Australia has shifted from \u201cfrom low- and middle-income earners to those in the top 10% of the income scale\u201d. Singing the LMITO blues: The cost-of-living relief trumpeted in the last federal budget will be cancelled out by the increased taxes from the scrapped low and middle income earners tax offset.

        "body": "Tuesday 9 January 8am Am I still alive? Well, I am sure still breathing; the pain all over my body is a sign that it is functioning. What does \u201calive\u201d mean? Is everything we are going through called life. I wonder about the difference between me and a dead person. Does the loss of safety and your hopes and dreams qualify you to be dead? Because if so, this means that Gaza has became a city of ghosts. Is it a life when you are helpless all the time, unable to even provide your loved ones with their basic needs? In a phone call with my friend, who I have been trying to reach for the past three months (wow! I cannot imagine it has been three months), she tells me that she and her family are still alive. \u201cMy children always ask me for their favourite food and toys,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI had to take them to the empty shops to show them that there is nothing left. I wanted badly to make them believe that I would sacrifice my whole life for a moment of safety and joy they could have, but there is nothing I can do.\u201d She tells me how, when she took her children out, she was holding them tightly to keep them safe and not lose them in the crowd. She talks about the huge numbers of people everywhere you go, and how the streets are packed. I share with her that a couple of weeks ago I saw a lost little girl who was crying. She couldn\u2019t see her family and hundreds of people were moving in all directions. I stood next to her and did not know what to do. I asked around if anyone knew her, but no one did. About 10 minutes later, a big man approached, he was almost taller than everyone in the street, and he had broad shoulders. He picked the girl up and put her over his shoulders and he kept turning around in a circle until her sister, a teenager, who was at the end of the street, saw and came running towards us. He put the girl down and she hugged her sister. 10am I go to check on my friend and I got the chance to meet the family that hosted him. They have the most adorable little girl. She is sociable and has a beautiful smile. The family tells me that she hasn\u2019t gone out of the house for almost three months. The little girl tells me about her friend and how much she loves her. It turns out \u201cher friend\u201d is actually a lady who lives in the building nearby. They never spoke together, but when the lady goes to put out the laundry, the girl puts her head out of the window and waves at her, the lady would smile back. \u201cSo, do you have any other friends?\u201d I ask. She says the lady is her only friend. \u201cI love her.\u201d Later on, I met \u201ca friend\u201d of mine. I have never met the man before, but it turned out that he used to work in the kitchen of one of my favourite restaurants. I was so glad to see him; he, somehow, was a connection to a life I no longer have. He tells me that he helped with preparing all the dishes and sweets, but his main task was the salads. He and everyone around start talking about the situation: what to expect, the fear of the unknown future. I say: \u201cCan we please speak about something else, something positive?\u201d \u201cLike what?\u201d he asks. \u201cLike salads,\u201d I say. He laughs. I ask, \u201cSo tell me, what was the most popular salad? I used to order Greek salad or caesar salad every time I had lunch at the restaurant. Also, you had the best molten cake in Gaza. I used to come especially to order it.\u201d I ask him if he cooks at his house, because I hear that chefs never do that after a long day of cooking. He says he cooks for his wife only. When they invited people over, they ordered takeaway. He shares many stories about the restaurant, and on his way out, he says he hopes we meet again. I tell him I will meet him one day in the restaurant and try one of his delicious salads. 1pm It is time to take little Hope, the cat we rescued and found a new place for him to stay, to his new home. My sister gives me a big bag that has wet food, dry food, his medicine and some cheese. He likes cheese. She also put the only two toys she got from our home. They belonged to our cats, they are in the shape of a reindeer and Santa Claus. She said he needs them more than our cats. I put him in the bag and get ready to go out when she stops me. She takes him out and asks him for forgiveness and promises him that if he and we make it out alive, she will visit. 6pm I receive a message from the guy who took Hope. He tells me that he is doing very well, and he sends me two photos. The photos take around two hours to open, but it was totally worth it. In one of them he was sleeping in his lap, and in the other he was chasing a ball. I am grateful we found this angel to take care of him. 10pm I have always been impressed by those who are eloquent with words; who have the capacity to express their inner thoughts precisely. I recall a message between me and a friend who lives abroad, I told her that the situation is getting worse. In her response she put the word \u201cgetting\u201d into brackets. I understood what she meant, for three months the situation has been awful. But what English word to use after bad? Worse? Worst? There are no stronger words to show the situation continues to deteriorate. Just when you think that you hit the rock bottom, you realise you were wrong. There is always a new low. Whether it is dignity-wise, basic needs-wise or just living. I miss a life where I would sleep on a bed, go to work, drink clean water, eat something I like of my own choice, meet friends and go back to the same bed and watch something online or read a book. I miss a life where mothers can walk in the streets and let their children run in front of them, enjoying the fresh air and, later, enjoy delicious foods and sweets. I miss a life where children have other children around, to play with, become friends, and start creating beautiful memories for their future. That life seems very distant and unrealistic. A fairytale I no longer think can exist.",

        "body": "Jayson on Eleanor What were you hoping for? A nice evening. I was curious about what it would bring. First impressions? A very nice and easygoing person. She was welcoming and a pleasure to talk to. What did you talk about? Eleanor\u2019s work at a local charity and her passion for fundraising. I was very impressed with how she travelled across Asia on her own at a young age. Travelling. Food. Horror films/TV shows. Family. Most awkward moment? I didn\u2019t drink any alcohol or eat a full meal. I\u2019d had a very late breakfast and I\u2019m in training \u2013 so perhaps that mismatch was a bit awkward. Good table manners? Yes, can\u2019t complain. Best thing about Eleanor? She has a great relationship with her family and friends, which is amazing. Would you introduce Eleanor to your friends? Yes. She is a funny person with a great personality. Describe Eleanor in three words. Open-minded, family-oriented, positive. What do you think Eleanor made of you? I hope she enjoyed the evening. We had very similar taste in horror films. Did you go on somewhere? No. And \u2026 did you kiss? The conversation flowed effortlessly, but it didn\u2019t feel charged with romantic potential. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Perhaps I would have had breakfast earlier, so I could have eaten a meal with Eleanor. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? Unfortunately, no. We had a great time but I don\u2019t think there was a spark. Eleanor on Jayson What were you hoping for? An evening of good food, laughter and possible flirting. First impressions? He was tall and had a really kind face. What did you talk about? Work. Holidays. TV we watched as kids. Jayson\u2019s passion for streetwear. Our shared love of horror films. Most awkward moment? Me dining solo. He wasn\u2019t hungry because he\u2019d had breakfast at 3pm! Good table manners? He didn\u2019t eat much or drink anything, so I\u2019m unsure about his table manners. Best thing about Jayson? We didn\u2019t stop talking. He was full of questions and stories about holidays and experiences running marathons. Would you introduce Jayson to your friends? Yes, although I\u2019m unsure if he would enjoy an evening with them. Describe Jayson in three words. Sweet, serious, polite. What do you think Jayson made of you? I think he found me rather unserious and wild, especially when I had my third solo spicy margarita. Did you go on somewhere? No, it wasn\u2019t really the vibe. And \u2026 did you kiss? No. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? That we could have shared a few small plates and sampled more of the menu. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? I don\u2019t think so. We are very different people, with different priorities in life. Eleanor and Jayson ate at Brooke, London SW4. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com",

        "body": "It is Saturday night and you are sitting cross-legged on the floor with a ham and pineapple oven pizza and a big cold glass of supermarket-brand cola. You are warm with the fresh clean glow of a bath and your nose is pressed close to the TV for Gladiators: Ulrika Jonsson\u2019s otherworldly charisma, that barking Scottish referee, oiled biceps and unitards, Wolf. Or: hold on, wait, no. It\u2019s 2024 now. Gladiators is back (Sat, 5.50pm, BBC One), and it still rules: Bradley Walsh\u2019s otherworldly charisma, Mark Clattenburg as the referee, intricately tattooed biceps and unitards, Viper. Time has passed and the pizza has gone cold but Gladiators remains the same. Some things in the world are good. I have to say that, despite the disorientating move from ITV to BBC, the latest Gladiators reboot (there was one on Sky in 2008 but we don\u2019t need to talk about that) is a phenomenal success, a modern update with just the right portion of nostalgia baked in. The athletes all have good old-fashioned Gladiator names \u2013 Athena, Sabre, Apollo, Bionic \u2013 and jog into the foam-finger-and-flashbang-filled arena in perfect 90s-style tracksuits. The Travelator is back, as are the best old games \u2013 Duel! Hang Tough! \u2013 as well as some new twists. Footy commentator Guy Mowbray is on comms. The whole thing absolutely zips along. The contenders are great and bustling with personality \u2013 Britain has spent the last three decades creating an army of cheerful gym rats, and they are ready to show how good they are by running up a hill that is trying to run against them. But wow, watching it is like being transported back in time: I feel as if I could get a Freddo for 10p, or get suspended from school for bleaching my hair like Gazza, or care about Blur. It\u2019s exhilarating. Our Gladiators, then. Giant is like if they put Ben White on performance-enhancing drugs instead of breastmilk. Electro has palpable \u201cM\u00fcller advert\u201d energy. Nitro is in more boys\u2019 group chats than any other person on Earth. Your parents are going to have an enormous row when your mum finds what your dad was trying to search on the iPad about Comet. Steel looks like he had to choose between this and a third-week exit on The Apprentice, and thankfully he chose to wield the pugil stick. If she was born in a different time, Fury has the vibe of someone chosen fifth to join a Pop Idol-era girlband. Legend is going to go one of two ways: beloved British TV star with a 40-year career, or has his Instagram DMs leaked by a tabloid and has to rebrand as a golf coach. Dynamite was born in 2003. Apollo wants to call you into a meeting room for a quick chat, nothing to worry about, nah you don\u2019t need a union rep. I\u2019m not saying anything about Diamond because she looks as if she could rip a car door off and hit me over the head with it. Primary schools across the country are going to have assemblies telling them all to stop \u201cpretending to be Viper and trying to kick each other in the head\u201d. I can\u2019t believe there are more: Athena (keeps taking Local Legend badges off you on Strava), Phantom (someone is genuinely going to go to prison for a graphic thirst tweet they send about him), Sabre (Scottish), Fire (is one day going to write a million-selling children\u2019s book about the power of sport). Bionic looks the most like he\u2019s from the 90s so he might spiritually be my favourite. All of them are very charming and nice (well, not Viper, but that\u2019s his bit) and magnanimous in defeat or victory. They say positive things to the contenders \u2013 \u201cHope you make it to the quarter-finals!\u201d \u2013 and there\u2019s a wholesome Locker Room Cam where they discuss how difficult each round was. But other than that, it\u2019s basically beat-for-beat the same show as 1992: even the ripping theme tune is intact. If Gladiators has one misstep, it\u2019s the presenting team. I am British and I am human, therefore I love Bradley Walsh on The Chase, but as nepo babies go I find his son Barney a flavourless dupe of his father and, crucially, quite sexless. Gladiators, at its peak, was a heroic arena-based kids\u2019 show that secretly undulated with sexual frisson, and no part of me feels that Barney Walsh is willing to explode his life to have a six-week affair with Sabre. This feels like an opportunity missed. Get AJ Odudu in for series two and we might have the best show in the world on our hands. Put the oven on and the cola in the fridge. We are back.",

        "body": "I understood that if I was going to do it, I would have to put 100% of myself into it,\u201d says Richard Osman about writing his debut crime novel The Thursday Murder Club, which was an immediate bestseller when it was published in 2020. He had attempted a novel before, but \u201cI wasn\u2019t giving it everything, I had too much on. And this was the first time where I thought: No, I\u2019m able to focus on this for a couple of years now.\u201d Osman\u2019s agent, Juliet Mushens, adds: \u201cHe told me he was working on a novel, but he didn\u2019t want to show it to anyone until he finished the whole thing.\u201d When he did, \u201cwe did a couple of drafts and submitted it to publishers\u201d. The rest is history: since The Thursday Murder Club was released, Osman has published three further novels and sold more than 10m books worldwide. He is the most successful example of a phenomenon that is more prominent than ever: the celebrity novelist. Of course, famous people have written novels for decades \u2013 from Alan Titchmarsh to Ben Elton. And the children\u2019s market has become saturated with celebrities, including David Walliams, Geri Halliwell-Horner, Paul McCartney and Jamie Oliver. But sales of adult fiction by celebrities have remained relatively low, until recently. According to Nielsen BookScan data, in 2018 the Top 100 paperback fiction bestsellers contained just one title by a celebrity author \u2013 Uncommon Type by Tom Hanks \u2013 with none in the Top 20. In 2023, the picture changed dramatically: eight of the top 100 bestselling paperback fiction books, and five of the top 20, were by celebrities \u2013 including books by Bob Mortimer, Richard Coles and Dolly Parton. Osman\u2019s exceptional success has seen an army of celebrity novelists follow in his wake. Opinion is divided on the phenomenon: some argue that a rising tide lifts all ships, so increased sales of novels by celebrities attracts readers to other books, too. Others believe that celebrity novels steal the oxygen of publicity from writers who don\u2019t have another career to fall back on. I spoke to publishers, agents and writers \u2013 celebrity and otherwise \u2013 to find out more about the growth of this very modern trend, and where it might go next. The first point of dispute is whether we should use the label \u201ccelebrity novelist\u201d at all. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a pejorative,\u201d says literary agent Jonny Geller of Curtis Brown, suggesting, he says, that \u201cthey\u2019re not serious writers, it\u2019s a bit of merchandise. They have a line of shoes, they have a podcast, and they have a book out.\u201d Broadcaster and journalist Lorraine Kelly, whose debut novel will be published in February, agrees. \u201cI\u2019d rather just \u2018novelist\u2019, to be honest.\u201d Non-celebrity novelist Stephanie Merritt, who writes as SJ Parris, dislikes hearing it for different reasons. \u201cMy heart sinks. I\u2019m not alone in feeling a degree of resentment at the investment that gets made into famous names.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something I find a bit frustrating,\u201d says Mushens, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think anyone would describe Stephen Fry as a celebrity novelist, would they?\u201d That is probably true, even though Fry was an actor and comedian before publishing his debut novel, The Liar, in 1991. Many of today\u2019s celebrity novelists were writers of another kind before turning to fiction. Bob Mortimer and Dawn French are comedians, and Osman was a writer and script editor for TV. Osman says that for people like these, \u201cit would be surprising if they didn\u2019t write books. If you write and you read, there comes a point where you have to write a book, otherwise something else is going to erupt out of you.\u201d Geller agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s got to be an obsession.\u201d But not all celebrity novelists are known for writing, nor do they always have books erupting from them. \u201cThe way the industry works is that we jump on bandwagons,\u201d says Phoebe Morgan, publishing director for commercial fiction at Hodder &amp; Stoughton, who publishes Graham Norton and Sara Cox. \u201cIf you get someone like Osman breaking out, everybody else tries to replicate that kind of success.\u201d This is not surprising: publishing is competing with other forms of entertainment in an increasingly fragmented media landscape, and an author with existing name recognition is a tempting prospect. The rise of TikTok as a book promotion tool means, says Geller, that publishers \u201ccan actually look at which people are trending, what themes people are reading, and can monetise that\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no question,\u201d adds Geller, \u201cthat publishers are looking for people with platforms; they\u2019re bringing a ready-made audience.\u201d His agency, Curtis Brown, \u201chas a big talent and presenters department, [and] we\u2019d get emails every week saying, \u2018Would so-and-so write a novel?\u2019\u201d Morgan confirms that it usually happens this way around: publishers approach celebrities. (Osman, who wrote his book before approaching an agent, seems to be an outlier.) But they\u2019re not looking for just any celebrity. \u201cThey like the idea of national treasures,\u201d Geller says, \u201cbecause people identify with them.\u201d One who surely fits this mould is Lorraine Kelly. \u201cYes, we were approached,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I was so excited about the fact that it was Maeve [Binchy]\u2019s publisher!\u201d Kelly\u2019s novel, The Island Swimmer, set in Orkney, is described by her publisher, Orion, as \u201can emotional novel about community, grief, connection and hope\u201d. Once the deal was agreed, however, \u201cthey left me to it\u201d. Kelly had to \u201ccarve out chunks of time\u201d to write her book, because \u201cwriting is a full-time job, and I already have a full-time job\u201d. But there is another kind of celebrity novel that is different from those by Osman or Kelly or others mentioned above: the ghostwritten novel, where a famous name, who may contribute ideas for a story or character or other elements, will work with a professional writer who does most, or all, of the actual writing. As Merritt says, \u201cpublishers are chasing after basically anybody who\u2019s been on the telly, whether or not they have the ability to write a novel.\u201d For Osman this is \u201can entirely different industry: people who are famous for different things, ghostwriting a book and putting that out.\u201d As he says, \u201cOf course the publisher will publish, because there\u2019s not really a downside.\u201d These ghostwritten celebrity novels also have a lineage: Naomi Campbell\u2019s Swan (1995), for example, was written by Caroline Upcher with almost no input from Campbell. The modern version tends to be more collaborative, drawing on the celebrity\u2019s knowledge of their industry, like Shirley Ballas\u2019s Murder on the Dance Floor \u2013 a cosy crime novel set in the world of ballroom dancing, which was written with Sheila McClure, an author of more than 30 novels. \u201cWhat publishers are looking for is clarity,\u201d says Geller. \u201cIf someone is famous for something, the novel should reflect that. If a celebrity on Gogglebox wants to write an adaptation of Medea, that\u2019s quite a challenge for a publisher.\u201d It seems that a key factor here is openness. \u201cMost people who don\u2019t write their own novel are open about it,\u201d says Osman. \u201cAnd that, to me, is not a con, because you know what you\u2019re getting. It\u2019s a brand thing.\u201d A recent example is Millie Bobby Brown\u2019s Nineteen Steps. Brown, an actor best known for Stranger Things, worked with ghostwriter Kathleen McGurl. But for her editor, Katie Seaman, who now runs her own editorial consultancy, Brown\u2019s personal connection to the book was crucial. \u201cWhat attracted me was that it felt authentic,\u201d says Seaman. \u201cThe fact that it was inspired by her family history \u2013 she was very close to her nan, who lived in Bethnal Green during the war.\u201d Brown\u2019s novel is in part about the Bethnal Green tube disaster, where 173 people were killed in March 1943. \u201cIn terms of a government cover-up, and the way it was portrayed by media, it felt timely,\u201d adds Seaman. McGurl is named on the title page (though not the cover), and Brown was open about the book being ghost-written, posting a photo with McGurl for her 63 million Instagram followers. But Brown attracted criticism nonetheless. \u201cGhostwritten celebrity novels have ruined children\u2019s fiction and now they\u2019re doing the same thing to adult fiction,\u201d wrote one user on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cPublishing is always a collaboration,\u201d says Seaman. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve edited a book, it\u2019s always felt like a partnership. If people are making an argument for a ghostwriter to be on the cover, where do you draw the line? Because often an editor could have a really heavy hand in shaping a manuscript.\u201d This is true: Raymond Carver\u2019s stories were cut to pieces by editor Gordon Lish to create the minimalist voice for which Carver then became celebrated. Why did Brown\u2019s novel receive so much opprobrium? \u201cIt did feel like some of the things that were levelled at her were ageist and misogynistic,\u201d says Seaman. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a different standard that young women are held to.\u201d What about the shadowy third category: the novels suspected to be ghostwritten but not declared as such? For Osman, \u201cThe contract you have with readers is that \u2026 at least [the author] has gone to extreme lengths to write something that represents them. That\u2019s the heart of all literature, whether commercial or literary. And if somebody doesn\u2019t do that, it just feels like a kick in the teeth.\u201d Lorraine Kelly agrees: \u201cAs long as you make it clear you\u2019re working with someone \u2026 because that\u2019s not fair if whoever\u2019s done all the work doesn\u2019t get the recognition.\u201d Sometimes there are suggestions a celebrity may have had help. In his novel Deadly Game, Michael Caine thanks journalist Matthew d\u2019Ancona for \u201chelping me put it together\u201d. Rob Rinder\u2019s novel The Trial acknowledges journalist Emily Fairbairn \u201cfor weed-whacking through my cerebral detritus to find an intelligible story\u201d. Neither novel credits a ghostwriter. (Rinder\u2019s publisher declined to speak to me for this piece.) Some may feel any ghostwritten book is intrinsically bad: that a novel is \u2013 in Evelyn Waugh\u2019s words \u2013 an exercise in language, and that a writer cannot convey an authentic vision of the world using someone else\u2019s words. But not all readers agree. \u201cSome people might be intimidated by a very literary novel,\u201d says Phoebe Morgan at Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u201cbut they look at celebrity fiction and think: \u2018That\u2019s accessible, because I recognise that person from TV.\u2019\u201d Geller points out that nobody minds about ghostwritten memoirs, but with fiction, \u201ceveryone feels quite precious about it\u201d. Maybe that is part of a larger objection to all celebrity novels, ghostwritten or not. \u201cThey seem to get to the front of the queue,\u201d says Merritt. Furthermore, \u201cyou don\u2019t hear it in other media. Judy Murray\u2019s agent is not saying to her, \u2018Oh Judy, you\u2019ve given birth to a famous tennis player, why don\u2019t you have a show at the Royal Academy?\u2019\u201d It is, says Merritt, \u201ca devaluing of writing as a craft that requires any professional skill\u201d. Crime novelist Ian Rankin says: \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t so successful I might have been pissed off about it. I used to moan to my agent and he said [celebrity novels] get people into a bookshop who have never been in a bookshop in their lives. I\u2019m a lot more sanguine than I used to be, but I can afford to be more sanguine.\u201d Morgan agrees with this analysis. Publishing a successful celebrity author means that \u201cwe might be able to take a risk on a debut author, because we\u2019ve made that money\u201d. Geller, who represents comedian Ruth Jones, acknowledges that \u201cthere\u2019s no question she has an advantage over a debut novelist living in the middle of nowhere\u201d. It is, in other words, easier to get your debut published if you have a public profile. But you cannot sustain four novels this way, as Graham Norton has, or \u2013 like Osman \u2013 enjoy success in countries where you\u2019re not already famous. Passion for doing it is key. Lorraine Kelly talks persuasively about \u201cthe sense of achievement I\u2019ve got, holding [my novel] in my hand\u201d. Osman\u2019s success may explain why other celebrities have followed him into crime, including Rob Rinder and Reverend Richard Coles, but there are notable celebrity hits in romance and comedy, too. Are any celebrities writing literary novels? Morgan suggests it may be that \u201cthe more commercial publishers are the ones that approach a celebrity, whereas more literary imprints don\u2019t do that as much\u201d. For Osman, literary fiction for a celebrity novelist is \u201ca harder nut to crack\u201d. One who tried it was David Baddiel. After two comic novels, his third, The Secret Purposes (2004), was an ambitious literary novel about the internment of British and Jewish-German refugees on the Isle of Man during the second world war. But, he says, there is a \u201cdeep resistance\u201d to celebrity novels in literary culture. \u201cAnd then I wrote The Death of Eli Gold, probably my best novel. And it\u2019s shallow on some level to want these books to be nominated for a prize,\u201d but there is, he says, \u201can unfortunate ecosystem between literary fiction and prize winning. It doesn\u2019t get read, really, unless you get nominated for one of the major prizes.\u201d He attributes this to the fact that \u201cfame is so fragmented now. Here\u2019s your corner of fame. People don\u2019t like it if you\u2019re encroaching on other arenas.\u201d He mentions Magnus Mills, whose debut, The Restraint of Beasts (1998), was shortlisted for the Booker prize while he was a bus driver. \u201cThat was an absolute plus for him. But if he\u2019d been a famous bus driver, if he\u2019d been on a reality show called The Bus Driver, it would not have been a plus for him.\u201d In the end, after Eli Gold, Baddiel \u201cgave up writing literary fiction\u201d, turning instead to highly successful nonfiction and children\u2019s novels. Not all celebrity novels do well, anyway. Remember model Cara Delevingne\u2019s Mirror Mirror (2017)? Me neither. \u201cIf you look at the charts for adult fiction, it isn\u2019t dominated by celebrities at all,\u201d says Juliet Mushens. \u201cThe books that work in the area are genuinely, extremely good.\u201d Osman thinks \u201cthe fiction world is actually unusually healthy for unknown voices. The hugest hits of recent years \u2013 Gabrielle Zevin, Bonnie Garmus \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have happened in film or TV.\u201d And will the bubble pop? Not just yet. Kelly is \u201calready working on my second one\u201d. Osman would \u201clove to do 20 or 30. It\u2019s the thing that most represents who I am.\u201d Morgan confirms she has recently signed two new celebrity novelists \u2013 names withheld, but they fit into Geller\u2019s \u201cnational treasure\u201d category. \u201cI think it\u2019s those personality types that people love and recognise, and also have a good story to tell,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is the best version of celebrity fiction.\u201d But will anyone surpass Richard Osman, whose latest book was the fastest-selling hardback ever by a British author \u2013 beating the record set by his previous novel? Geller has an idea. \u201cThe most popular book that hasn\u2019t happened is Taylor Swift\u2019s novel,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cThat will get every demographic.\u201d Mr Osman \u2013 watch out.",

        "body": "A long-running and acrimonious dispute at an actors\u2019 charity involving some of the best-known names of the British stage and screen is to return to the spotlight next week amid claims of boardroom coups and electoral gerrymandering. The quarrel at the \u00a340m Actors\u2019 Benevolent Fund (ABF) has also triggered fierce criticism of the Charity Commission. In a rare admission of fault, the watchdog has accepted it made serious errors in its two-year handling of the controversy. The row has played out since a dramatic takeover in 2022 resulted in the contentious ousting from the fund\u2019s ruling body of its former president Dame Penelope Keith, and actors including Dame Si\u00e2n Phillips and James Bolam, by a group of rival trustees. Since then the two sides have been engaged in a costly war of words conducted through the media and lawyers\u2019 letters, with the \u201cousted\u201d trustees and their supporters arguing their removal from the board was illegal. The ABF operates hardship funds for actors and stagehands in England and Wales who are in need. Its patron is King Charles, and famous past presidents include Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Gielgud. It gave out \u00a3900,000 in grants to 430 beneficiaries in 2022. The row has flared again as the fund\u2019s 750 members prepare to vote for a new council on Wednesday, amid accusations that the charity\u2019s ruling body has tried to marginalise candidates who have publicly criticised it, including the Harry Potter star Miriam Margolyes and Cold Feet\u2019s Robert Bathurst. The pair have been placed by a nominations committee on a list of six \u201cother\u201d candidates on the voting papers, in contrast to the \u201crecommended\u201d list of 12 candidates, which includes five existing trustees, including the fund\u2019s president, the actor Esh Alladi, who has overseen the fund for the past two years. Several new \u201cfresh blood\u201d candidates are on the recommended list, including the actor and biographer Simon Callow, the Birds of Feather actor Lesley Joseph, and Rob Rinder, best known for the reality courtroom TV show Judge Rinder. A spokesperson for the fund rejected the claim it had sought to influence voters through the ballot forms. It had appointed an independent nominations committee to identify the best candidates and \u201censure a robust, fair and independent process of the highest order\u201d, they said. The spokesperson added: \u201cIt is [the nomination committee\u2019s] expert opinion that the recommended 12, with their array of skills and experience, would be the most effective in running the charity. It is in the best interests of the charity therefore to make this clear to the members.\u201d Charity law experts are alarmed that the removal of Keith and her colleagues in 2022 not only breached company law but was in effect subsequently condoned by the Charity Commission, which has been supervising the fund since early 2022. A series of letters of complaint from Keith to the commission\u2019s chief executive, Helen Stephenson, in the summer resulted in the regulator agreeing to undertake an internal investigation into its handling of the case. That investigation, by a senior commission official, is now complete. It concluded Keith and the excluded trustees were treated unfairly, and that the commission \u2013 which privately admitted the 2022 council election that facilitated the board takeover was \u201cflawed\u201d \u2013 was wrong to side with the ousting trustees. However, the commission has offered no apology or remedy to Keith, and has so far refused to address her complaint that it misused its powers when it formally ratified the \u201cousting\u201d trustees in April 2023. The ousted trustees are considering whether to take legal action against the commission. Bathurst, who qualified as a barrister before becoming an actor, said the regulator\u2019s errors had caused avoidable financial and reputational damage to the fund. \u201cI\u2019m sure charity lawyers will be looking keenly at this to see how easy it is to take over a charity unlawfully under the nose of the Charity Commission,\u201d he said. A commission spokesperson said: \u201cWe stand by our decision to intervene in this damaging and costly dispute about the Actors\u2019 Benevolent Fund governance. Our review does not change what the charity must do to get back on track. All parties agree on the need to appoint a board of trustees, via an election open to all members, and we continue to require them to do so under our legally binding order. \u201cAs a fair and accountable regulator, we are always open to the opportunity to review and explain our decisions. We will take forward lessons into how we handle other cases where trustee appointments are disputed.\u201d",

At 16, he moved to the Royal Ballet school in London and graduated into the company two years later. In 2019, he was promoted to principal dancer \u2013 recent roles include Siegfried in Swan Lake and Franz in Copp\u00e9lia. Samb\u00e9 will perform in Manon at the Royal Opera House on 17 January and 17 February. 1. Theatre A Strange Loop at the Barbican This was a remarkable piece of theatre. Watching it was like holding up a mirror: it made me question my behaviour as a gay man and how I can be more authentic in my homosexuality. It\u2019s about a young man who is writing a musical and trying to represent the experience of being Black and queer. His family wants him to do a religious, Tyler Perry-style musical, but he wants to have a fresh take. The performers were incredible and the choreography was sumptuous, but what was really special to me was how it hit a nerve and raised so many important questions. 2. YouTube Soft White Underbelly This is a very interesting and quite shocking series of interviews with people in Los Angeles who\u2019ve had their lives turned upside down: homeless people, rape victims, people with addiction. The interviewer, the photographer Mark Laita, is very frank and direct with his questions. One interviewee I\u2019ve found particularly inspiring is Rebecca, a trans woman with incredible views on politics, beauty and society. The series is voyeuristic but I\u2019m learning so much from watching it, and I look at people struggling with homelessness or addiction in a different way. 3. Art Marina Abramovi\u0107 at the Royal Academy In New York a few years ago, I remember seeing the massive queues outside MoMA for Marina Abramovi\u0107\u2019s show The Artist Is Present. Since then, I\u2019ve been mesmerised by her work, so it was nice to finally experience it first-hand at the Royal Academy. This exhibition covered key moments from her career as a performance artist: the bow and arrow film [Rest Energy], the naked couple in the doorway that you\u2019ve got to squeeze past. The show really takes you on a journey through her life. I loved it so much, I went twice. 4. Film Rotting in the Sun I loved this movie. The director, Sebasti\u00e1n Silva, creates really intimate and interesting films and has a very specific voice. Here, he plays a film-maker in Mexico City who is struggling with his identity and his work. He meets a horrific LA-based influencer and they decide to collaborate, but then something unexpected happens and the movie completely changes. It was a magical experience to be surprised like this in the cinema. It\u2019s the most fascinating movie, hilarious, satirical and dark. And Catalina Saavedra gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s housekeeper Vero. 5. Music Stormzy at All Points East festival This Stormzy concert in August was magical. I love Stormzy. He holds culture in his voice, and his charisma is so powerful that when he came on stage I had shivers going down me. He started with a very emotional part of his album where he reflects on the world and how kids are taught to be and what they\u2019re exposed to. Then he moved on to heavier songs with powerful beats. When he sang about rain falling on his enemies, the rain started pouring down. It was such a cinematic moment \u2013 everyone in the crowd was exhilarated. 6. Restaurant Planque, London E8 This is a restaurant in east London with a gorgeous atmosphere, amazing food and the most incredible wine list. Whenever I go, I have a great time. It\u2019s in the arches beneath an overground station so it looks quite unassuming from the outside, but inside it\u2019s got this quiet luxury that I love so much. The last time I went, the monkfish was excellent and I had calf\u2019s brains, which I\u2019d never tried before but really enjoyed. There\u2019s an effortlessness and openness to the place and lots of surprising elements. It\u2019s a really special restaurant.",

        "body": "The millions of workers who will get a bit more cash in their pay packet from this month have the perfect opportunity to increase their retirement savings before they get used to having the extra money, say experts. Younger employees could eventually increase their retirement pots by more than \u00a3100,000 by diverting their monthly gain from the national insurance (NI) cut into their pension. Last Saturday, the main rate of national insurance contributions (NICs) paid by employees dropped from 12% to 10%. Ministers say 27 million UK employees are benefiting from this reduction, which was announced in November. Someone on an annual salary of \u00a330,000 will have an extra \u00a3348 in their pocket each year; for higher earners the gain is up to \u00a3754 a year. Many people will need that cash to help with bills and other essential costs such as buying groceries or paying down debts. For those who can afford it, Dean Butler, at the pension provider Standard Life, says it is worth paying it into a pension: \u201cWhile it\u2019s tempting to see this as extra spending money, it\u2019s worth trying to save at least a portion of it. \u201cEven small additional contributions now could give you a big retirement boost.\u201d Bertrand Pole, at the wealth management firm Evelyn Partners, says workers are often advised to pay more into their pension when they get a pay rise because it will give their long-term finances a significant boost, but they won\u2019t feel any worse off on a month-to-month basis. \u201cThe same applies here, as the NI cut is a perfect opportunity to increase retirement savings without making sacrifices,\u201d he says. Evelyn Partners crunched the numbers to see what the potential gains could be. The figures are based on someone\u2019s pension contributions being increased each month by an amount equal to the gain from the NI cut, so their take-home pay stays the same, with tax relief then added. A basic-rate taxpayer will in theory see their income rise by up to \u00a362.83 a month as a result of the NI reduction. If they pay this straight into their pension, it will be worth \u00a378.53 a month because of the 20% tax relief on contributions. Younger workers will enjoy a bigger boost to their retirement savings because there is more time for their investments to grow. According to Evelyn Partners, a 25-year-old basic-rate taxpayer could end up with as much as \u00a3134,300 extra in their pot, assuming that they work and save until age 67. For a 55-year-old, the uplift could be \u00a315,500. The figures are higher for higher-rate taxpayers as that \u00a362.83 turns into a \u00a3105 contribution because of the 40% tax relief they get. As a result, a 25-year-old higher-rate taxpayer could be up to \u00a3179,600 better off by age 67, while for a 55-year-old, there could be an extra \u00a320,800. The calculations assume that people\u2019s pots grow by 5% a year after fees. However, other factors could increase the final figures: for example, some employers will match, or part-match, extra contributions made by employees, which would mean more going into their fund. Instead of carrying on working to their target retirement age and then benefiting from their bigger pot, some of those who divert the extra cash to their pension could decide to retire from work a few years earlier than originally planned. The NI reduction involves \u201cclass 1\u201d contributions made on earnings received by anyone between the age of 16 and state pension age who is getting more than \u00a3242 a week from one job. It means employees now pay 10% on earnings between \u00a3242 and \u00a3967 a week.",

        "body": "The Environment Agency faces new allegations of neglect of the River Wye after a project by a conservation group found effluent and contaminated waters at free-range egg farms flowing directly into watercourses. Of 47 sites visited in England and Wales in the Wye catchment, 19 had drains running from the poultry units to a nearby watercourse. Many of the farms had drains excavated within a few metres of the sheds. Charles Watson, chair of River Action, the charity that obtained details of the advisory visits to free-range egg farms under freedom of information laws, said: \u201cThese documents show a large number of intensive egg production farms have been allowing the excrement of hundreds of thousands of chickens to run off, without any proper mitigation, straight into the river system. \u201cThis is in clear breach of the regulations, and the bodies protecting the environment have largely been in denial while this has been going on. There has been scandalous neglect over the years.\u201d The Wye has been blighted by poultry pollution with hundreds of new production units approved in the last two decades to feed the nation\u2019s huge demand. The condition of the river was downgraded last May after campaigners warned its ecosystem had been devastated by intensive poultry production. The advisory visits to farms were conducted by the Wye and Usk Foundation, which works to improve the ecology of those two rivers. The visits were done in partnership with free-range egg farmers, including suppliers to Noble Foods, owner of the free-range brand the Happy Egg Company. In an email to Environment Agency (EA) officials sent last February, the foundation said drainage water from the farms was \u201ca pollution risk and should not be directed to watercourses\u201d. It added that the issue was \u201cvery common and one that we have found very difficult to address\u201d. The charity was seeking guidance as to how the runoff should be treated. It is working with farmers to improve protection of the catchment area from effluent and agricultural drainage water. Simon Evans, chief executive of the foundation, said: \u2018Many of the challenges we are trying to resolve are the legacy of historic poor planning decisions, such as when the planners have insisted the units be located too close to watercourses. \u201cIn some cases, the solutions are not obvious and require careful consideration along with guidance from regulators. Noble has been actively engaged in helping to find and fund solutions on the farms that supply them, and their support is driving the progress that is being made to resolve the issues.\u201d River Action is seeking a judicial review of the EA over allegations it had failed to protect the Wye from agricultural pollution. It is claimed the agency has failed to prevent the spreading of excess organic manure or properly apply the rules. Ricardo Gama, a solicitor at Leigh Day, which is representing River Action in the judicial review, due to be heard next month at the high court in Cardiff, said: \u201cRiver Action\u2019s ultimate goal is that the agency takes a strong hand and actually starts enforcing these rules.\u201d The EA said: \u201cWe recognise the River Wye is under pressure, which is why we are already offering a wide range of support to farmers around the river to speed up their transition to more sustainable practices. We work closely with groups like the Wye and Usk Foundation, who provide advice to farmers. \u201cIn the Wye catchment, we carried out 493 farm inspections and issued 285 improvement actions from 1 April to 31 December 2023. These inspections targeted high-priority catchments such as protected habitats, and those where intelligence indicated rule breaches and pollution.\u201d Noble Foods said: \u201cOver the last three years [we] have been working hard with our producer base in the Wye and Usk region. We are supplied by family-run farms in the region, which represent less than 5% of the total poultry flock in the area. We are encouraging our producers to embrace nature-based solutions, such as wetland pools, as part of our work with the Wye and Usk Foundation.\u201d Gary Ford, chief executive of British Egg Industry Council said it was \u201ccommitted to complying with legal requirements and ensuring that egg production does not adversely impact the local environmental infrastructure.\u201d He said the council was funding a number of independent research projects in this subject area. \u201cThe initial evidence suggests that the impact of free-range farming is likely to have a minimal, if any, direct effect on the increased phosphate levels in the Rivers Wye and Usk.\u201d Rhian Jardine, head of development planning at Natural Resources Wales, said: \u201c[Welsh Water] has published data which indicates that rural land use is contributing to 72% of phosphorus loading of the upper Wye. We will use all the resources at our disposal to prevent pollution. We also recognise that we can\u2019t reach lasting solutions alone. Everyone has a role to play.\u201d",

        "body": "For Caroline Babayan, the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic was a wake-up call. She was locked down in Oslo, where she has lived for the past 40 years with her wife and children, and found herself thinking about the shape of the years to come. \u201cI asked myself what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI was 62 and I might only have 15 or 20 good years left. I realised that I should do the things that I had wanted to do and not leave it for another day. It was the push I needed.\u201d What she had always wanted to do was dive. Ever since she devoured Jules Verne\u2019s sci-fi classic Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea as a 10-year-old, Babayan has harboured a love of the ocean. Despite growing up in landlocked Tehran, 1,200m above sea level, she would dream about living in a glass dome underwater and when her family took her on holidays to the Caspian Sea, she would spend as much time as possible swimming. \u201cIt was a fantasy life for me as an only child,\u201d she says. \u201cI lived in my imagination and the ocean was just endless with wonder.\u201d In 2021, after decades spent working in adult education, Babayan enrolled in a diving certification course to finally make her dreams of exploring the ocean come true. She took her written theory test and soon began trying out diving equipment in a pool. At first, it was a struggle. \u201cEach body floats differently, so you have to get your weighting right, otherwise you don\u2019t sink properly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can feel really tiresome, like you\u2019re always struggling.\u201d Once her instructors found her correct weighting, she then began diving in open water, but that also brought its challenges. \u201cI started in November and the water in the fjords in Norway was so cold,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI had to wear a drysuit, which was really heavy and uncomfortable \u2013 I didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d Still determined to have a positive experience, a month later Babayan took to warmer waters on a family holiday to Lanzarote and eventually managed her debut dive. \u201cThe first time I dived successfully, it was as if I was flying,\u201d she says. \u201cYou see fish swimming above you, which is so strange, and it gave me that feeling of freedom I had imagined as a child. I knew then that this is what I wanted to continue doing.\u201d Since that first trip, Babayan, now 65, tries to fit in at least two diving holidays each year and still finds that same sense of adventure each time she sinks into the water. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating seeing all the marine life, but it\u2019s also so calm because the only thing you hear is your own breathing,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to concentrate on your breath, almost like meditation.\u201d One recent trip involved diving in a cave in Sardinia and plunging into a \u201cworld within a world\u201d. \u201cThe silence was amazing,\u201d she says. It might sound terrifying to some but Babayan makes sure to always dive with an instructor at hand and to not stray much deeper than 20 metres. Diving has remained a solo pursuit. Babayan\u2019s wife hasn\u2019t trained because she wears glasses and contact lenses, while her grandchildren mainly find it amusing that their granny enjoys such an adventure sport. Still, Babayan finds strength in having the experience for herself, no matter her age. \u201cYour age is in other people\u2019s eyes and our bodies are far more resilient than we know,\u201d she says. \u201cI have never encountered any issues or prejudice about being an older diver. I have a medical checkup every two years to keep my certification and as long as that\u2019s OK I will carry on.\u201d She travelled to Hanoi for her most recent diving trip before journeying farther south in Vietnam to explore the South China Sea. \u201cOne of the perks of growing older is that you don\u2019t have to worry about what other people might think of you any more,\u201d she says. \u201cGo out and try whatever it is you\u2019ve been waiting to do. Fulfil your dreams!\u201d \u2022 Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",

        "body": "When he was a Ku Klux Klansman in South Carolina, Elwin Wilson helped carry out a vicious assault that left John Lewis with bruised ribs, cuts to his face and a deep gash on the back of his head. Half a century later, Wilson sought and received Lewis\u2019s forgiveness. Then both men appeared on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s TV show. Wilson looked overwhelmed, panicked by the bright lights of the studio, where nearly 180 of Lewis\u2019s fellow civil rights activists had gathered. But then Lewis smiled, leaned over, gently held Wilson\u2019s hand and insisted: \u201cHe\u2019s my brother.\u201d There was not a dry eye in the house. Raymond Arsenault, author of the first full-length biography of Lewis, the late congressman from Georgia, describes this act of compassion and reconciliation as a quintessential moment. \u201cFor him, it was all about forgiveness,\u201d Arsenault says. \u201cThat\u2019s the central theme of his life. He believed that you couldn\u2019t let your enemies pull you down into the ditch with them, that you had to love your enemies as much as you loved your friends and your loved ones.\u201d It was the secret weapon, the way to catch enemies off-guard. Bernard Lafayette, a Freedom Rider and close friend of Lewis, a key source for Arsenault, calls it moral jujitsu. Arsenault adds: \u201cThey\u2019re expecting you to react like a normal human being. When you don\u2019t, when you don\u2019t hate them, it opens up all kinds of possibilities. The case of Mr Wilson was classic. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my lifetime, for sure.\u201d Arsenault, a history professor at the University of South Florida, St Petersburg, has written books about the Freedom Riders \u2013 civil rights activists who rode buses across the south in 1961 to challenge segregation in transportation \u2013 and two African American cultural giants: contralto Marian Anderson and tennis player Arthur Ashe. He first met Lewis in 2000, in Lewis\u2019s congressional office in Washington DC, a mini museum of books, photos and civil rights memorabilia. \u201cThe first day I met him, I called him \u2018Congressman Lewis\u2019 and he said: \u2018Get that out of here. I\u2019m John. Everybody calls me John.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t an affectation. He meant it. He seemed to value human beings in such an equalitarian way.\u201d Lewis asked for Arsenault\u2019s help tracking down Freedom Riders for a 40th anniversary reunion. It was the start of a friendship that would last until Lewis\u2019s death, at 80 from pancreatic cancer, in 2020. \u201cFrom the very start I saw that he was an absolutely extraordinary human being,\u201d Arsenault says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever met anyone quite like him \u2013 absolutely without ego, selfless. People have called him saintly and that\u2019s probably fairly accurate.\u201d Arsenault was approached to write a biography by the historian David Blight, who with Henry Louis Gates Jr and Jacqueline Goldsby sits on the advisory board of the Yale University Press Black Lives series. The resulting book, John Lewis: In Search of the Beloved Community, examines a rare journey from protest leader to career politician, buffeted by the winds of Black nationalism, debates over the acceptability of violence and perennial tensions between purity and pragmatism. Arsenault says Lewis \u201cwas certainly more complicated than I thought he would be when I started. He tried to keep his balance, but it was not easy because a lot of people wanted him to be what is sometimes called in the movement a \u2018race man\u2019 and he wasn\u2019t a race man, even though he was proud of being African American and very connected to where he came from. He was always more of a human rights person than a civil rights person. \u201cIf he had to choose between racial loyalty or solidarity and his deeper values about the Beloved Community [Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s vision of a just and compassionate society], he always chose the Beloved Community and it got him in hot water. He, for example, was criticised for attacking Clarence Thomas during the [1991 supreme court nomination] hearings and of course he proved to be absolutely right on that one. \u201cThere were other cases where if there was a good white candidate running and a Black man who wasn\u2019t so good, he\u2019d choose the white candidate and he didn\u2019t apologise for it. He took a lot of heat for that. Now he\u2019s such a beloved figure sometimes people forget that he marched to his own drummer.\u201d Lewis\u2019s philosophy represented a confluence of Black Christianity and the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, Arsenault says. \u201cHe had this broader vision. There\u2019s not a progressive cause that you can mention that he wasn\u2019t involved with in some way or another. \u201cHe was a major environmentalist. There was a lot of homophobia in the Black community in those years but not even a hint [in Lewis]. He was also a philosemite: he associated Jews as being people of the Old Testament and he was so attracted to them as natural allies. Never even a moment of antisemitism or anything like that. He was totally ahead of his time in so many ways.\u201d \u2018A man of action\u2019 Lewis was born in 1940, outside Troy in Pike county, Alabama, one of 10 children. He grew up on his family\u2019s farm, without electricity or indoor plumbing, and attended segregated public schools in the era of Jim Crow. As a boy, he wanted to be a minister. Arsenault says: \u201cI have a picture of him in the book when he was 11; they actually ran something in the newspaper about this boy preacher. He had something of a speech impediment but preached to the chickens on the farm. They were like his children or his congregation, his flock, and he loved to tell those stories. \u201cBut he was always bookish, different from his big brothers and sisters. He loved school. He loved to read. In fact his first protesting was to try to get a library card at the all-white library.\u201d Denied a library card, Lewis became an avid reader anyway. He was a teenager when he first heard King preach, on the radio. They met when Lewis was seeking support to become the first Black student at the segregated Troy State University. \u201cHe was a good student and a conscientious student but he realised that he was a man of action, as he liked to say. He loved words but was always putting his body on the line. It\u2019s a miracle he survived, frankly, more than 40 beatings, more than 40 arrests and jailings, far more than any other major figure. You could add all the others up and they wouldn\u2019t equal the times that John was behind bars.\u201d Lewis began organising sit-in demonstrations at whites-only lunch counters and volunteering as a Freedom Rider, enduring beatings and arrests. He helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), becoming its chair in 1963. That year, he was among the \u201cBig Six\u201d organisers of the civil rights movement and the March on Washington, where at the last minute he agreed to tone down his speech. Still, Lewis made his point, with what Arsenault calls \u201cfar and away the most radical speech given that day\u201d. In 1965, after extensive training in non-violent protest, Lewis, still only 25, and the Rev Hosea Williams led hundreds of demonstrators on a march of more than 50 miles from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama\u2019s capital. In Selma, police blocked their way off the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Troopers wielded truncheons, fired tear gas and charged on horseback. Walking with his hands tucked in the pockets of his tan overcoat, Lewis was knocked to the ground and beaten, suffering a fractured skull. Televised images of such state violence forced a reckoning with southern racial oppression. Lewis returned to and crossed the bridge every year and never tired of talking about it, Arsenault says: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t one to talk about himself so much, but he was a good storyteller and Bloody Sunday was a huge deal for him. He said later he thought he was going to die, that this was it. \u201cHe passed through an incredible rite of passage as a non-violent activist and nothing could ever be as bad again. He\u2019d been through the fire and so it made him tougher and more resilient. It\u2019s origins of the legend. He was well considered as a Freedom Rider, certainly, and already had a reputation but that solidified it and extended it in a way that made him a folk hero within the movement.\u201d Lewis turned to politics. In 1981, he was elected to the Atlanta city council. Five years later he won a seat in Congress. He would serve 17 terms. After Democrats won the House in 2006, Lewis became senior deputy whip, widely revered as the \u201cconscience of the Congress\u201d. Once a young SNCC firebrand, sceptical of politics, he became a national institution and a party man \u2013 up to a point. \u201cThat tension was always there,\u201d Arsenault reflects. \u201cHe tried to be as practical and pragmatic as he needed to be but that wasn\u2019t his bent. \u201cHe was much more in it for the long haul in terms of an almost utopian attitude about the Beloved Community. He probably enjoyed it more when he was a protest leader, when he was kind of a rebel. Maybe it\u2019s not right to say he didn\u2019t feel comfortable in Washington, but his heart was back in Atlanta and in Pike county. As his chief of staff once said, wherever he went in the world, he took Pike county with him.\u201d The fire never dimmed. Even in his 70s, Lewis led a sit-in protest in the House chamber, demanding tougher gun controls. As a congressman, he was arrested five times. \u201cHe was absolutely determined and, as he once said: \u2018I\u2019m not a showboat, I\u2019m a tugboat.\u2019 He loved that line. Nothing fancy. Just a person who did the hard work and was always willing to put his body on the line,\u201d Arsenault says. \u2018If he hated anyone, it was probably Trump\u2019 Lewis endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2008 but switched to Barack Obama, who became the first Black president. Obama honoured Lewis with the presidential medal of freedom and in 2015, on the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, they marched hand in hand in Selma. Lewis backed Clinton again in 2016 but was thwarted by Donald Trump. Arsenault says: \u201cHe was thrilled by the idea of an Obama presidency and thought the world was heading in the right direction. He worked hard for Hillary in 2016 and thought for sure she was going to win, so it was just a devastating thing, as it was for a lot of us. He tried not to hate anyone and never would vocalise it but, if he hated anyone, it was probably Trump. He had contempt for him. He thought he was an awful man. \u201cThat was something I had to deal with in writing the book, because you like to think it\u2019s going to be an ascending arc of hopefulness and things are going to get better over time, but in John Lewis\u2019s life, the last three years were probably the worst in many respects because he thought that American democracy itself was on the line.\u201d When Lewis died, Washington united in mourning \u2013 with a notable exception. Trump said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t come to my inauguration. He didn\u2019t come to my State of the Union speeches. And that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s his right. And, again, nobody has done more for Black Americans than I have.\u201d Arsenault says: \u201cThey were almost like antithetical figures. Lewis was the anti-Trump in every conceivable way, but when he died in July 2020 he probably thought Trump was going to win re-election. Within the limits of his physical strength, which wasn\u2019t great at that point, he did what he could, but the pancreatic cancer was so devastating from December 2019 until he died. \u201cIt was tough to deal with that part of the story but, in some ways, maybe it\u2019s not all that surprising for someone whose whole life was beating the odds and going against the grain. He had suffered plenty of disappointments before that. It just made him more determined, tougher, and he was absolutely defiant of Trump.\u201d Lewis enjoyed positive relationships with Republicans. \u201cHe was such a saintly person that whenever there were votes about the most admired person in Congress, it was always John Lewis. Even Republicans who didn\u2019t agree with his politics but realised he was something special as a human being, as a man. \u201cHe had always been able to work across the aisle, probably better than most Democratic congressmen. He didn\u2019t demonise the Republicans. It was Trumpism, this new form of politics, in some ways a throwback to the southern demagoguery of the early 20th century, this politics of persecution and thinly veiled racism. He passed without much sense that we were any closer to the Beloved Community.\u201d Lewis did live to see the flowering of the Black Lives Matter movement after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He was inspired, a day before he went into hospital, to visit Black Lives Matter Plaza, near the White House. \u201cFor him it was the most incredible outpouring of non-violent spirit in the streets that he\u2019d ever seen, that anybody had ever seen,\u201d Arsenault says. \u201cThat was enormously gratifying for him. He thought that in some sense his message had gotten through and people were acting on these ideals of Dr King and Gandhi. \u201cThat was hugely important to him and to reinforcing his values and his beliefs and his hopes. I don\u2019t think he was despondent at all because of that. If that had not happened, who knows? But he\u2019d weathered the storms before and that\u2019s what helped him to weather this storm, because it was it was so important to him.\u201d Lewis enjoyed fishing, African American quilts, sweet potato pie, listening to music and, as deathless videos testify, dancing with joy. Above all, Arsenault hopes readers of his book will be moved by Lewis\u2019s fidelity to the promise of non-violence. \u201cWhen you think about what\u2019s happening in Gaza and the Middle East and Ukraine right now, it\u2019s horrible violence \u2013 and more than ever we need these lessons of the power of non-violence. [Lewis] was the epitome of it. You can\u2019t help but come away with an admiration for what he was able to do in his lifetime, how far he travelled. He had no advantages in any way. \u201cThe idea that he was able to have this life and career and the American people and the world would be exposed to a man like this \u2013 in some ways he is like Nelson Mandela. He didn\u2019t spend nearly 30 years in prison, but I think of them as similar in many ways. I hope people will be inspired to think about making the kind of sacrifices that he made. He gave everybody the benefit of the doubt.\u201d John Lewis: In Search of the Beloved Community is published in the US by Yale University Press",

Apart from his family (he\u2019s been married twice and has seven children), he says it\u2019s the first thing he has done in his life that he\u2019s truly proud of. He likes to see the day his father died as a rebirth. It\u2019s not that Michael disliked his dad. He loved him and couldn\u2019t have admired him more. After all, Chaplin Sr is not only one of the greatest actors ever, but the first ever global celebrity, recognisable by his silhouette alone. The moustache, bowler hat, walking stick and splayed feet of his creation The Little Tramp remains iconic. There were so many remarkable scenes in his films \u2013 Charlie caught in the cogs of capitalism in Modern Times; the blind flower girl seeing him for the first time at the end of City Lights; prospectors struggling up the snowbound Chilkoot pass in the The Gold Rush; the Jewish barber, pleading for kindness while impersonating fascist leader Adenoid Hynkel in The Great Dictator. And that\u2019s just the start of it. Charlie was a one-man film industry \u2013 writer, director, producer, editor and even composer of the movies made at his own studio. In 1919, he co-founded the distribution company United Artists, giving him complete control over his films. There were the controversies, too. While he was feted as a cinematic visionary, he was demonised by FBI director J Edgar Hoover for his alleged communist sympathies and proclivity for teenage girls, and feared by some he worked with for his control freakery. \u201cHe cast a huge shadow over me,\u201d says Michael, the second of eight children from Chaplin\u2019s fourth and final marriage, to Oona O\u2019Neill (Charlie had 11 children in total). He was dwarfed by his father\u2019s personality, intimidated by his power and sometimes simply scared of him. For much of his life, he says, he has been trying to find a purpose. \u201cIn my early years, I just drifted from one thing to another, I wasn\u2019t doing anything solid.\u201d Was he aware of his father\u2019s genius as a little boy? He nods. \u201cYes, but in a negative way. It was rammed down my throat. My teachers would always say: \u2018You\u2019ll never be like your father.\u2019\u201d He tried his hand at acting and pop music, briefly became infamous as a pot-smoking hippy in swinging 60s London, and spent many years running a goat farm in a remote part of south-west France. He says it was only after his father died that he realised what he really wanted to do with his life: write. \u201cOnce he died, I thought: \u2018Yes, now I should write the novel. I should go ahead and do something.\u2019\u201d It was a new start? \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d But progress wasn\u2019t quick. Michael is one of life\u2019s great procrastinators and it\u2019s taken him the best part of a half-century to produce something worthwhile. \u201cI tried to write novels when I was younger. I thought I\u2019d have plenty to say, then when I sat down with the pen and paper I found I had nothing to say.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt was very upsetting.\u201d One day a friend took him aside and told him that the problem with his writing was that it was superficial, that it never dealt with deeper truths. \u201cHe said: \u2018Michael, your problem is you\u2019re afraid to put yourself down on the page.\u2019 He was right. I had to be braver. Put yourself, your weakness in the characters. It has to come from within you.\u201d * * * Bravery is a recurring theme in Michael\u2019s life \u2013 and in his novel. His father, he says, was astonishingly brave. Charlie\u2019s parents, both music hall performers, separated before he was five. He barely knew his alcoholic father, while his beloved mother lived with mental illness throughout her adult life. Charlie and his brother Sydney spent their early years in and out of Lambeth Workhouse in London. And yet from this desperate start, he reached unimaginable heights \u2013 creatively and financially. He died one of the wealthiest men in the film industry, leaving an estimated $100m to his family (roughly $500m, adjusted for inflation). Michael could not have been more different: ambition to him was a filthy word. A Fallen God is a beautifully told epic fairytale for all ages. While adults may wrestle with themes of church and state, action and inaction, and the transformative power of love, it could be read to kids as a bedtime story. The obvious hero is Tristan \u2013 a swashbuckling man of action, irresistible to Isolde. It\u2019s possible to see Charlie in the character, but Michael insists that was not his intention. By contrast, Isolde\u2019s husband, King Mark, is passive to the point of paralysis until he finally learns the importance of fighting for love. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m Mark,\u201d he says. In what way? \u201cI\u2019ve been through the things he\u2019s been through. I haven\u2019t been a very dynamic person. I wasn\u2019t doing anything with my life. I was quite happy but it was a problem for my wife, it was a problem for my wife\u2019s father, and it became a problem for the children. I had no ambition at all.\u201d It wasn\u2019t always this way. In the 60s, Michael seemed very much like a man of action. He spent his first few years in Beverly Hills, California, where his father was a victim of McCarthyism. Charlie sided with the left, refused to cross picket lines in the 1945-46 Hollywood strikes, and supported the Progressive party candidate Henry Wallace in the 1948 presidential election. He insisted he was not a communist (\u201cI do not want to create any revolution, all I want to do is create a few more films,\u201d he said) but the FBI was determined to destroy him. It fed classified information and rumours (often about relationships with much younger women) to the Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and, before long, Charlie was regarded as a traitor in the United States. By 1952, his film Limelight, which featured Michael in the opening shot, was being picketed. Charlie had never applied for citizenship and, while he was sailing to London with the family to promote Limelight, the US government revoked his re-entry permit. The family moved to Switzerland, where Michael spent the rest of his childhood living in a neoclassical mansion on the banks of Lake Geneva. Did Michael know why they were suddenly living on a different continent? \u201cNo. I was six years old when we were on the ship coming to Europe and he received a telegram saying he couldn\u2019t go back to America. I heard it without understanding.\u201d Michael would ask his mother when they would return home \u2013 but she would never reply. His father was in a terrible state. \u201cHe thought he could lose all his money, which was in America,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother took a plane back to sign all the money into Mexico.\u201d It must have been terrifying for him, I say. \u201cI think so. But he\u2019s a fighter.\u201d Does he still think of his father in the present tense? \u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s in there somewhere.\u201d * * * Michael is with his wife, the painter Patricia Betaudier Chaplin, in M\u00e1laga when we Zoom. He spends part of the year there, part in Switzerland. He looks like a rough-hewn version of his father, with a touch of Willie Nelson thrown in for good measure. A fedora is perched on his head, his leather jacket is gnarled and his white ponytail slides down his back. He\u2019s clearly never lost his inner \u2013 or outer \u2013 hippy. I ask what Charlie was like as a father. \u201cIntimidating,\u201d he says. He was tough, unyielding and often remote with his sons. Less so with his daughters. Michael believes Charlie\u2019s lack of a male role model as a child resulted in him struggling with his sons. \u201cHe never really mentioned his father. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever really seen or known him, but he\u2019d talk about his mother endlessly. He adored her. \u201cHe always said: \u2018I\u2019m a loner, I have no friends.\u2019\u201d Was that true? \u201cNot really. He had a big family and loads of friends that came to the house: Graeme Greene, Truman Capote, No\u00ebl Coward, loads of writers.\u201d Michael pauses. Actually, he says, most of them were really friends of his mother\u2019s. Oona, Charlie\u2019s fourth wife, was the daughter of the playwright Eugene O\u2019Neill. She loved writers. She married Chaplin when she was 18 and he was 54. \u201cI had a very close relationship with my mother,\u201d Michael says. \u201cShe gave me an appetite for reading. She introduced me to books like L\u2019Etranger by Camus.\u201d Did she write herself? \u201cShe wrote wonderful letters \u2013 funny, colourful and gossipy. She asked them to be destroyed after her death.\u201d Why? \u201cShe kept herself in the shadows. It was where she was comfortable.\u201d It was hard not to be in the shadows around his father. Michael talks of his first experience on a film set with him, when Charlie was making Limelight. \u201cI remember this huge studio, and hearing my father\u2019s voice through a loudspeaker. I couldn\u2019t see him. He was saying: \u2018No! Go over there!\u2019 I was quite intimidated.\u201d When Michael was 10, Charlie cast him in A King in New York. The film, a satire of the McCarthy witch-hunt, was Charlie\u2019s final leading role. Michael played a precocious teenager well versed in Marx \u2013 a sharp contrast to Michael who had never read a political text in his life. Did he enjoy working with his father? \u201cI loved it. It had a biblical side to it. In ancient days, the sons went to work with their father in the field or wherever, and it felt like that.\u201d The film gave him a taste for acting. But Charlie, who had no formal education, was determined that his sons in particular do well academically. \u201cHe said: \u2018Your only defence in this world is to be educated.\u2019\u201d Did Michael listen? \u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t listen to him ... I couldn\u2019t listen in school. I couldn\u2019t hear the teacher even if I was interested. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d He was tested for dyslexia. \u201cThere was a French teacher I liked, and she said: \u2018Don\u2019t let them tell you that you\u2019ve got dyslexia \u2013 you\u2019re just lazy.\u2019\u201d Did that make him feel better or worse? \u201cBetter. I didn\u2019t want to have a condition.\u201d His father\u2019s patience with him wore thin. Charlie could be so funny and playful, but his son rarely saw that side. \u201cWhen he wanted to, he could entertain us. He was great at mime. He had a lot of weapons to amuse us with.\u201d Did his father teach him his skills? \u201cNo, he did with his daughters. He, Geraldine and Victoria would do duets on the piano. He related to them. I never felt that he didn\u2019t love us, but he could get very angry and frustrated.\u201d Did the anger express itself in physical violence? \u201cNo. He gave me a few spankings but that was normal in the 50s.\u201d As Michael got older, their relationship became more troubled. At 16, he ran away to be with his girlfriend. \u201cI said I was going camping with friends and I went straight to London to see her. I didn\u2019t come back for two years.\u201d How did his parents react? \u201cMy father wouldn\u2019t speak to me.\u201d At 18, he started a relationship with the actor Patricia Johns (now Patrice Chaplin), who was seven years his senior. They tried to get married in Barcelona, but because Michael was so young he needed his parents\u2019 permission. They refused to grant it. Didn\u2019t it strike him as hypocritical that his father, whose first two wives were both 16, wouldn\u2019t let him marry a woman of 25? \u201cI didn\u2019t make the connection,\u201d he says. Charlie met his second wife, Lita Grey, when she was 15 and he was 35. When she became pregnant, her mother threatened to report him to the police. He could have been charged with statutory rape in California. A discreet marriage was hastily arranged in Mexico. When they divorced three years later, Grey accused him of statutory rape, seduction of a minor, soliciting abortions and \u201cperverted sexual desires\u201d, details of which were leaked to the press. The judge awarded Grey the world\u2019s then-largest divorce settlement of more than $800,000 (approximately $14m today) \u2013 $625,000 for her, and $100,000 to be placed in a trust for each of their children. Does Michael think his father was a paedophile? \u201cThey were young brides, but he was not breaking the law. The rock singer Jerry Lee Lewis married a girl of 13 and he got into trouble. My father didn\u2019t get into trouble because she was a bit older, I suppose. I don\u2019t want to defend my father, but I don\u2019t think he was ever someone to use women purely sexually. He fell in love with a lot of young ladies, but he wasn\u2019t forcing them to have sex.\u201d Back in London, Michael won a place at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, but he didn\u2019t finish the course. His fellow students had \u201call read Shakespeare. They were keen, ambitious. And I was smoking marijuana and having a good time. I had no talent for acting.\u201d Was he disappointed? \u201cNo, I was in full swinging 60s mode. I was reading Burroughs and was into the counterculture.\u201d After the story of his failure to marry Johns in Barcelona became front-page news, the pair got married in England, which also made headlines. When it was discovered that he and Johns, who by now had a baby son, were claiming benefits, they were all over the newspapers again. It\u2019s strange that was considered news, I say \u2013 you\u2019re hardly the first people to have claimed benefits. \u201cYes, but not the son of a millionaire.\u201d How did his father feel about it? \u201cWe never spoke about it. I\u2019m sure he was absolutely furious.\u201d On 5 April 1965, the front page of the Daily Telegraph ran with the headline: \u201cMy son should work, says Oona Chaplin\u201d beneath a photograph of a bearded Michael. A couple of days later, Michael was back in the news again after signing a record deal. Was he a good pop singer? He looks sheepish, and tells me he released a single called I Am What I Am. \u201cTo be honest with you, I hadn\u2019t written the song. I needed some money at the time, and I let these people tell me what to do and they released the record. It didn\u2019t go anywhere in the charts, and didn\u2019t deserve to.\u201d His most memorable newspaper appearance came in 1966, after he published a memoir at 19 with the fabulous title I Couldn\u2019t Smoke the Grass on My Father\u2019s Lawn. Even better, he then went to court to try to stop his own book being published \u2013 and failed. It had been written by two ghost writers and was rammed with potentially libellous material. How did the family feel about it? \u201cMy father was very angry because I wasn\u2019t too kind to him and some of his friends \u2026 Again we didn\u2019t talk for a long time after it.\u201d What had he said about Charlie? \u201cIt stereotyped him a bit.\u201d How? \u201cDiscontented, never happy.\u201d Was that image unfair? \u201cYes, absolutely. You can say it on the surface. But you see where he came from and how he had to fight to get where he was. And he had deep relationships with HG Wells, Bernard Shaw, Winston Churchill. He and Einstein would go out in Hollywood and have fun.\u201d Around this time, Charlie was making a film with Marlon Brando called A Countess from Hong Kong. Brando later called Charlie \u201cfearsomely cruel\u201d, \u201can egotistical tyrant\u201d and \u201cthe most sadistic man I\u2019d ever met\u201d. It was inevitable that they\u2019d fall out, Michael says. \u201cI thought: \u2018How can they work together? They\u2019re just complete opposites.\u2019\u201d While Brando liked to do his own thing, Charlie insisted on choreographing every move. Michael was banned from the set because Charlie still wasn\u2019t talking to him. \u201cHe thought I wasn\u2019t doing anything; wasting away. And he was right.\u201d Despite this, he says, he ended up working on the film without his father\u2019s knowledge after the producer, an old family friend, gave him a job. \u201cI was sorting out photographs of young actresses and running errands.\u201d Did he get a credit? He laughs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a job that merited a credit, but I got to meet Brando. He invited me to supper one night in his house.\u201d He does a mumbling Brando impersonation. \u201cHe said to me: \u2018I\u2019ve seen you and your father,\u2019 and he pointed his finger at me.\u201d What did he mean by that? \u201cBrando could read people, and he saw I was keeping a protective distance when dealing with my father, because he was quite explosive. He could relate to it. I suppose he liked me because he was also having problems dealing with him.\u201d Michael\u2019s marriage to Johns ended when he was 20. He met Betaudier Chaplin the following year, and they have been together ever since. In 1978 they retreated to south-west France to bring up their children (who include the actors Carmen and Dolores Chaplin) on a farm. Was he a good farmer? He shakes his head. \u201cWe only had six acres and 30 goats. The farmers\u2019 union accepted me because they needed farmers. Occasionally, they came at 8am when we were all asleep in bed to see if we were doing anything.\u201d He produced a bit of milk, but not enough to live on. But they had a \u201cvery nice subsidy\u201d. The whole region was being abandoned. \u201cThere was no industry there, the schools were emptying and there was a lower population in the region than in the middle ages.\u201d So what attracted him? The landscape, he says. \u201cI love that place. We were right in the heart of the Crusades against Cathars and you can feel a real melancholy there.\u201d The Cathars were a 12th- and 13th-century sect that preached an austere form of Christianity and believed the world was created by an evil force. They were regarded as heretics by the Catholic church and were burned at the stake on huge pyres. The slaughter of the Cathars eventually became the backdrop for A Fallen God. * * * It was on the goat farm, where they spent 13 years, that Michael began to be undone by his lack of ambition. The way he talks about it, he almost stopped being a player in his own life, feeling that whatever he achieved, he knew he couldn\u2019t compete with his father, or match his father\u2019s hopes for him. \u201cI was going nowhere, and everything was falling apart in the family we created. Our marriage was going through a hard time. My wife is much more dynamic and she doesn\u2019t mince her words. I despaired about my life and what it had become. It was a hard moment, but it gave me something to write about. I\u2019m very grateful \u2026\u201d It took him two decades to complete the book but his malaise provided the inspiration for King Mark in the novel. And, in turn, King Mark became a means of addressing that malaise. \u201cI wanted it to be about how you can bring yourself out of a state of despair. If you can accept it on a mythical level, then it can lift you out\u201d I ask if he ever reconciled with his father. Not fully, he says. But there are positive memories from later years. He tells me of the time Charlie discovered that he had Roma blood, and how proud both of them were. One of the few things they shared was a love of Gypsy culture. Then there was a time he took his father to a cafe he\u2019d discovered behind Victoria station in London that served jellied eels and mash. \u201cHe was really enjoying it.\u201d But then Charlie soured the occasion. \u201cI think he thought he was being too good to me so he looked at me and tapped me on the shoulder and said: \u2018You know your sister Geraldine is a great actress.\u2019\u201d He laughs \u2013 this time wistfully. \u201cJust to let me know!\u201d Perhaps his happiest memory is an occasion when he feels Charlie came closest to acceptance of, or even respect for, him. Charlie was in his 80s, and retreating further and further into himself. \u201cWe went to a very expensive restaurant in Paris when he could still talk just a little. I was talking about Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance [Robert M Pirsig\u2019s fictionalised autobiography] and explaining it to my mother, and he looked at me and said: \u2018You\u2019re a mystic.\u2019 I felt very touched.\u201d He looks on the verge of tears. After his father\u2019s death, Michael began to reassess their relationship. Perhaps Charlie had only wanted to toughen him up for the world \u2013 his greatest fear was that his children would experience the hardship he had as a child. Michael also became more critical of himself. \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t a good son. I ran away from home. I embarrassed him \u2026\u201d He trails off. Soon after his mother died in 1991, Michael and his brother Eugene and their families moved into their parents\u2019 Swiss mansion. They lived there for 10 years before it was turned into a museum, Chaplin\u2019s World, which finally opened in 2016. Was this a way of preserving their father\u2019s legacy? \u201cTo be honest, a house that size just swallows money, and we were going bankrupt. But when we were there, so many people would come knocking at the door from all around the world, so we got the idea of a museum. And it\u2019s a very good museum.\u201d Today, Michael feels at peace \u2013 with his father, and himself. He knows that many of his loved ones doubted that he would finish his book. \u201cIt became a kind of joke,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s writing his book.\u2019 But I knew I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to not finish it.\u201d Is he working on another one? He smiles. \u201cThis took 20 years. I don\u2019t think I have 20 years left for another, but who knows?\u201d He says his mother would be thrilled that he\u2019s finally a published novelist. As for his father, he doesn\u2019t like to presume to speak on Charlie\u2019s behalf, so he tells me a story instead. \u201cThere was a coming together with my father, but it happened after his death. That\u2019s why they say you count the years of your life from the moment of your father\u2019s death. I started having powerful dreams where I confronted him and we talked together. It was when I went back to Switzerland and the family house. He\u2019d stopped at that point being an obstacle and was opening the doors for me to live.\u201d He tells me of one particular dream about the Christmas card the Chaplins used to send out every year featuring a family photo. \u201cFor a long time, I was out of that Christmas card because I was abroad. When I came back, I was still not put back in that family photo. I wasn\u2019t happy about not being in that picture, nor was my wife. Then I had a dream about meeting my father under this huge Lebanese pine tree in front of the house. He walked me into the living room, opened up the cupboard and he gave me that photograph, but now me and the whole family were in the card. Then I woke up.\u201d The dream gave him a sense of closure, he says. \u201cI think he was telling me, wherever he is, that he\u2019s not excluding me from his life.\u201d \u2022 A Fallen God by Michael J Chaplin is published on 28 January by the Book Guild.

Although it\u2019s not really funny, is it? It\u2019s limiting. We live by these blurred guidelines telling us how we should look and what society expects of us at every stage of our lives. \u201cWe\u2019re sold a myth that self-expression is for the young, but why shouldn\u2019t people be doing the same after lifetimes of responsibility \u2013 and repression?\u201d says celebrity hairstylist and founder of Bleach London, Alex Brownsell. Brightly coloured hair is more mainstream now than ever before, so my advice is to seek out people in their 50s and beyond living by their own beauty rules: take Helen Mirren\u2019s pink hair phase and Vivienne Westwood\u2019s trademark orange. If you decide to lean into it, Brownsell has some advice: \u201cIt\u2019s best to apply colour to clean, dry hair if the hair is grey. Pastels tend not to work on naturally grey hair, so I\u2019d suggest using vivid shades \u2013 pinks, reds, peaches and coppers often work well.\u201d Rules in beauty and fashion are made to be broken, because so often they were designed to make us buy things or to conform. As we age we have even more of a right to look how we want, and that includes using our bodies as a personal canvas. Got a beauty question for Anita? Email her at BeautyQ&amp;A@theguardian.com",

Rather than privatising public landholdings at a fraction of their value, as undertaken by Margaret Thatcher, much of the land in Vienna is held under public ownership or by cooperatives, reducing the inflationary pressures of speculators and making housing affordable and attractive in socially mixed communities. A start could be made by taxing land at its existing or approved land value; this would put developers in the UK under pressure to deliver housing for which they have planning permission, helping to meet increasing needs. Promoting communal landholdings and requiring that at least 35% of all new housing is genuinely affordable would improve social diversity, while increasing the number of council tax bands would enhance the revenues of local authorities and finance environmental improvements and public facilities.

        "body": "Something interesting happens in the first few pages of Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s recent memoir-cum-self-help book Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life. It opens on a moment of weakness, as he describes his lowest point: the day he told his wife that he\u2019d fathered a baby with their housekeeper. \u201cNo failure has ever felt worse than that,\u201d he writes. But that isn\u2019t the interesting part. \u201cI won\u2019t be rehashing that story here,\u201d he sniffs, refusing to dwell on it for even a sentence longer. Instead, he instructs readers to Google the story if that\u2019s the sort of gossip that happens to get them going. The rest of the book continues at the same sort of clip, with Schwarzenegger wresting away any looming hint of introspection that might impinge on yet another anecdote about the time he cut the legs off his trousers to remind himself to work on his calves. I have to confess to tumbling down a bit of an Arnie\u2011hole after reading Be Useful, seeking out all sorts of interviews with him, purely to see if he has ever managed to display any vulnerability in public. The closest I got was an interview with Howard Stern, ostensibly to promote the forgotten 2015 film Terminator Genisys. At one point Schwarzenegger admitted that he had once attended couples therapy with his then wife. But, just like in the book, he clammed shut when asked if he got anything out of it. \u201cIt was the biggest mistake I\u2019ve ever made because that guy was so full of shit,\u201d he said. He claimed the sessions were full of \u201cnonsense talk\u201d that was \u201ccounterproductive to our future relationship\u201d. So why did he go? Because his wife talked him into it, apparently. It has the making of a million memes: \u201cMen would rather become an indestructible robot and eradicate humanity than go to therapy.\u201d The thing is, though, his book, and his life, make a seductive argument for just marching ahead unexamined \u2013 although whether his ex-wife would agree is a different matter. To Schwarzenegger, a moment spent exploring his inner motivations is a moment where he isn\u2019t able to manifest his external ones, whether that\u2019s becoming, briefly, the world\u2019s highest-paid actor, successfully entering politics or Instagramming videos of the donkey he lets roam around his kitchen. It seems like a good life. But it doesn\u2019t seem particularly fair of him. A big part of couples therapy, maybe even the biggest, is finding a space where you can learn to communicate properly again. And that\u2019s bound to be difficult when one half of the couple a) doesn\u2019t want to do it in the first place and b) is determined not to get anything out of it. Counsellor Priya Tourkow has a number of theories about why people might not want to take the plunge. \u201cThey think the therapist is going to sit there and not say anything. Or they\u2019re worried that the therapist will be on their partner\u2019s side. There can be a real fear of opening Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d That fear might be exacerbated if you\u2019d happened to catch Showtime\u2019s Couples Therapy, currently on iPlayer \u2013 a series that seems to exist as a warning for people who aren\u2019t in couples therapy not to have couples therapy. Admittedly, it might be a bad example from which to extrapolate, because the programme isn\u2019t just about couples having therapy, but about couples who actively want their sessions to be broadcast on television; an impulse that, you suspect, can\u2019t be all that good for a relationship. But even accounting for this, Couples Therapy isn\u2019t a particularly good advert. It\u2019s the sort of show that forces you to take sides. It\u2019s Jeremy Kyle with better dentistry. Thankfully, this isn\u2019t what most couples therapy is in reality. It isn\u2019t a competition where you pay someone to pick a winner, where there\u2019s a hero we can root for, and a villain to despise. And this, I would guess, is why Schwarzenegger didn\u2019t enjoy his session. \u201cCouples therapy is based on the premise that having the best relationship you can have is a good idea,\u201d argues Tourkow. If that\u2019s not how you see it, then it may well be a waste of time. Even with the best will in the world, however, it\u2019s still going to be hard, \u201cbecause there are habits that build, and we\u2019re all going to get triggered \u2026 One of the things that happens in couples therapy is that you learn to talk to each other. How much more foundational does it get than that?\u201d I should probably come clean and point out that I know Priya quite well. My wife and I started having sessions with her almost as a joke \u2013 a newspaper asked us to have couples therapy and write about it \u2013 only for us to instantly realise that, oh shit, we might actually need couples therapy. It wasn\u2019t fun, because of course it wasn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t easy to hear all the ways that you\u2019re not perfect, and the sessions never end when the session ends, because you invariably have to travel home together afterwards in the immediate aftermath of some horrible home truths. But it did help. We learned techniques to cool things down in tetchy moments that would have otherwise rocketed off into the stratosphere. We actually apologise to each other sometimes now. Imagine. This isn\u2019t a blanket endorsement. For some, perhaps especially the overthinkers among us, certain forms of therapy might get you more bogged down, rather than freeing you up. Ester Perel, the closest the therapy world has to a superstar thanks to her wildly popular podcast, warns: \u201cIronically, we often are inclined to seek the form of therapy that matches our defences rather than help us change it.\u201d Not only that, but \u201cfor many people, therapy is still filled with stigma and talking to a stranger is a bizarre practice\u201d. Bizarre it may be, and judging from his book and his social media, things are going great for Schwarzenegger. But it does seem quite odd that someone who has made a career out of working hard and battling through adversity couldn\u2019t face the prospect of sitting in a room with his wife and talking about his problems. That said, it\u2019s not unknown for couples who resisted therapy at first to return once they\u2019ve exhausted other options. With any luck, he\u2019ll be back.

        "body": "On Sunday in Taipei, the sun rose. The city\u2019s parks and morning markets filled with people enjoying the unseasonable warmth, and the smell of the city\u2019s inexplicably expensive coffees drifted through the laneways as scooters buzzed through the crowds of pedestrians and bicycles. Twelve hours earlier an election watched by the world, framed as a choice between \u201cwar and peace\u201d or \u201cdemocracy and authoritarianism\u201d with existential implications for the global order, came to an end. A winner was declared, a loser conceded, voters were either overjoyed or disappointed. China \u2013 the aggressor party in this situation \u2013 was predictably cranky. But that was it. For some of the many Americans here, watching this presidential vote, 10 months ahead of their own, was inspiring but also a little painful. The global superpower which for so long has heralded itself as the leader of the democratic world is no longer the best example of it. For Taiwan\u2019s 23.5 million people at the weekend, they proudly held that title. The campaign was a boisterous, hyperpartisan, chaotic affair that inspired almost 72% of eligible voters to show up at the polls. Many of them also returned at the end of the day to watch the count, an extraordinarily transparent and analogue process involving volunteers holding each paper ballot up and shouting the voter\u2019s choice to another worker who marked it down \u2013 in pencil \u2013 on an A3 sheet stuck to the wall with sticky tape. Thousands of others gathered outside party headquarters to hear the seats called in real time. In Taipei it was hard to push through the heaving Democratic Progress party (DPP) crowd. Confetti rained down as it was announced that Lai Ching-te and his running mate Hsiao Bi-khim had won. The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) event in New Taipei city was sad from the start. Rows and rows of empty red stools, a small national flag hopefully placed on each one, sat empty. Journalists paced the ground, outnumbering the interviewees they were searching for. Voters returned the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to presidential power but took away their majority in the legislature. A new third party, the Taiwan People\u2019s party (TPP), split the opposition vote but also inspired a surge of idealistic youth to join its ranks. For many voters, regardless of stripe, the biggest takeaway from the election is pride in the system itself. The small democracy won plaudits internationally its robust and transparent vote, despite efforts from China to influence the outcome and in marked contrast to Taiwan\u2019s recent history of authoritarian rule. Saturday\u2019s vote was only the eighth time that Taiwanese citizens have chosen their own president in free elections. The KMT\u2019s candidate, Hou You-yi, was praised for his swift concession on election night. He told a small crowd of disappointed supporters that he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for failing to win. \u201cI respect the final choice of the voters. This is a democratic election, which means that the voters decide the election\u2019s outcome. We need to face the voters and listen to them,\u201d Hou said. Some had backed him primarily because they thought it important that Taiwan\u2019s government undergo a change in leadership. \u201cIt should be considered natural; every four years we should switch to a better government,\u201d says Jerry Peng, who voted for Hou. But \u201cI still want to congratulate the DPP, because they won some of the hearts in Taiwan. I hope that they can continue to do the right thing.\u201d Such a sentiment would have been impossible in his father\u2019s generation. Across the political rallies, attendees shared their strong political opinions, but also encouraged the Guardian to speak to as many people as we could to get all perspectives. \u201cIt has not been easy for us to get to where we are now,\u201d 83-year-old Mr Song says at a pre-election rally, detailing the brutal history of Taiwan\u2019s authoritarian era. \u201cWe people work hard together. We have deep freedom. It is a holy land for freedom, Taiwan is very free.\u201d Government of many colours Now the dust has settled, the hangovers have faded and the confetti has been cleared, political observers are mulling the implications. In his acceptance speech Lai said the DPP had \u201cnot worked hard enough\u201d to get a majority, and that Taiwan\u2019s people \u201cexpect an effective government as well as strong checks and balances\u201d. He declared he would study the policies and positions of his opponents and that they would be incorporated \u201cas long as they bring benefit to the people\u201d. He said he would appoint cross-party members to official roles. There are concerns the new DPP administration is going to struggle to push its policy agenda through the parliament. It had campaigned on a platform largely centred on defending Taiwan from China\u2019s annexation threats, but domestically, the third-placed TPP \u201chold the pivotal place in the parliament,\u201d says Nathan Batto, associate research fellow at Academia Sinica and author of the Frozen Garlic Taiwan political blog. \u201cThey will have power. They\u2019re more likely to side with the KMT because their whole discourse is being an opposition party.\u201d Trouble in east Asia\u2019s oldest party? For the KMT, having failed to secure more than 40% of the vote in three successive elections, some are wondering if east Asia\u2019s oldest party could be in terminal decline. However, Batto says deep introspection in the party is unlikely. \u201cThe KMT internal politics is dominated by the hardcore Chinese nationalist wing of the party. The party members who vote in party elections and make the party decisions are heavily skewed towards the old military families with strong Chinese nationalist tendencies. That makes it very hard to reform or move away from old positions within the party.\u201d Part of Lai\u2019s victory can be attributed to the lack of a credible opposition. The KMT won seats in the legislature, but the fact that the DPP, which is defined by its pro-sovereignty stance, has won an unprecedented three terms in office suggests that the KMT\u2019s position on Taiwan\u2019s cultural and economic links with China is out of kilter with public opinion. Alexander Huang, the director of international relations for the KMT, disagrees. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe that we [the KMT] have a Taiwan identity problem right now. I really don\u2019t think so. Because everyone is Taiwanese. I was born and raised here.\u201d The problem, says Huang, is that the KMT failed to explain clearly to Taiwanese voters the nuances of their position, something that is \u201cvery hard to translate into campaign slogans\u201d.",

        "body": "For the most part, my partner and I have a great and loving relationship. I used to be very horny, but these days I just don\u2019t have the time or energy. We have a young child and I am a step-parent to his three grownup kids; if we lived on our own, we would have the house to ourselves more and probably have kinkier sex, but having his 18-year-old son living with us is killing me. I left a houseshare years ago because I was well and truly over it. Now, I\u2019m having to share the house I worked so hard for with an 18-year-old who doesn\u2019t care. My partner wants to give him an easy time, but I think his son\u2019s lack of ambition shows that he is lazy and coddled and will end up living with us for far longer than I want. I\u2019ve worked hard to get to the point where I can enjoy my life and do what I want on my own terms. I may sound spoilt, but my partner and I had amazing sex until his son started hanging around the house all day, every day. You have every right to set boundaries to create a more palatable living situation for yourself. You need to have a frank \u2013 but careful and loving \u2013 conversation with your partner and let him know how you feel. Do this without putting a lot of blame on the 18-year-old, but at the same time express that you think he should be encouraged to do something with his life. It is rarely helpful for anyone to support laziness and enabling behaviour \u2013 gently help your partner to see that his son\u2019s independence deserves to be encouraged.

        "body": "Deprived children are being robbed of a lifetime of reading for pleasure, by governments that are \u201csimply blind\u201d to the benefits of loving literature from an early age, according to the author Michael Morpurgo. Morpurgo and a coalition of leading authors, including Julia Donaldson, Malorie Blackman and Cressida Cowell, are backing a call by BookTrust to ensure that every child from a low-income family has access to books and reading activities by investing in a programme across schools and nurseries. \u201cWe have to acknowledge the right of every single child in this country to have access, physically, intellectually and emotionally, to reading. And that will not happen unless the books are there, and it will not happen unless books are shared early,\u201d said Morpurgo, the author of well-loved classics such as War Horse and The Butterfly Lion. Morpurgo said the UK had a \u201cdivision of opportunity\u201d between children with access to books, whose lives and education were \u201cmassively enriched\u201d as a result, and those from deprived backgrounds that did not. \u201cAny government that doesn\u2019t recognise this is simply blind,\u201d said Morpurgo. \u201cWe do have a hugely divided society, particularly at the moment when we have so many millions living in poverty, and these are the very children who are exposed to this lack of commitment to passing on what is arguably the greatest asset we have in this country, our literature from this remarkable language we have got. \u201cThese are also the most likely children to be suffering from mental health issues, from lack of self-worth and from family problems at home. These are the very children who most need to find the pathway to fulfilment and achievement that books can bring.\u201d Research by BookTrust has found that only half of children aged between one and two from low-income families are read to every day. Morpurgo is one of the 12 past and present children\u2019s laureates who have signed the BookTrust\u2019s letter to Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, as well as to the first ministers and opposition leaders in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Library closures by local authorities were particularly likely to affect disadvantaged families, according to Morpurgo, by closing off a vital source of access to books. \u201cWe should never, ever, in this country close down a library again,\u201d he said. \u201cI live in the middle of Devon, where the nearest library is a long way away, we\u2019re talking about a 35-minute drive if you have a car and a lot of people haven\u2019t. There\u2019s no local bookshop, even if you had the money. The library is the last lifeline to reading.\u201d Morpurgo also called for government to allow schools more time to encourage reading for pleasure, rather than as tools for passing exams. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have got to get away from, the idea that English literature and books are just something to study. They\u2019re not. They are there to enjoy and become part of your life, not just to be studied and quizzed on,\u201d Morpurgo said. \u201cThat is where governments can help. In schools, teachers complain all the time that there is no room in the curriculum, there\u2019s no room for just sitting and telling and reading a story. \u201cWhen I go to schools, time and time again teachers say it\u2019s so important but there isn\u2019t time. Well, the government can provide that time and recognise that the enjoyment of a story when you are five, six or seven is so important, not just for your education but throughout your life.\u201d Morpurgo said the call by BookTrust and Scottish Book Trust applied across the UK\u2019s national boundaries. \u201cWe are part of the same society, and it\u2019s important for our democracy in all our countries that we understand truth. There is great truth in literature \u2013 it sound ridiculous but fiction is rather a wonderful way of accessing truth. \u201cWhat do you learn from the plays of Shakespeare or the books of Dickens? You learn about how deceitful and wretched and vile people can be, you learn about the spread of humanity \u2013 it\u2019s so important that children are exposed to this, and quite young too, so it means something to them and not just something they study at school.\u201d",

        "body": "Deteriorating flood defences mean more than 200,000 homes in England are at risk of flooding, with MPs blaming Environment Agency budget shortfalls. A report by MPs on the public accounts committee said the EA had failed to meet a target of maintaining 98% of \u201chigh consequence\u201d flood defences. The agency has had to downgrade the number of properties it aims to protect by 2027 from 336,000 to 200,000. New houses were being built on floodplains without checks being carried out to make sure suitable flood defences had been put in place, the MPs said. They described the failure as \u201cunforgivable\u201d. Some 5.7 million properties were at risk of flooding in England in 2022 and 2023 and this number is expected to increase as climate breakdown brings more intense downpours more often. Flooding across the UK earlier this month damaged nearly 2,000 properties. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, deputy chair of the Commons committee, said robust flood resilience must become a priority. \u201cThe depredations caused by such disasters are a matter of life and death for communities up and down the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis inquiry has uncovered the alarming truth that in a number of ways, the approach to keeping our citizens safe in this area is contradictory and self-defeating, not least in the continuing development of new housing in areas of high flood risk without appropriate mitigations.\u201d The committee said the government should set a measure of how many properties were protected from flooding that took into account the number with poor defences, as well as new constructions. It should also ensure that smaller projects found it easier to get approval so that rural villages had the same right to protection as others, they said. Clifton-Brown said: \u201cThe number of properties at risk of flooding from deteriorating defences eclipsing those benefiting from new ones is another case in point. This is emblematic both of the government\u2019s failure to strike the right balance between maintenance and construction, and of not considering the net number of properties at risk. \u201cOne of the first steps in delivering any successful policy is clearly defining what success looks like. We hope the recommendations in our report help the government to do so.\u201d Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 housing, communities and local government spokesperson, said: \u201cAreas like mine in Shropshire have had to face year after year of inundation with virtually no support, and what there is is only set to dwindle, ruining more lives. \u201cUnder this Conservative government, flood protection plans have been shamefully neglected \u2013 and ordinary people\u2019s homes and businesses are being turned upside down as a result. \u201cEnough is enough. The Conservatives must get a grip and give communities like mine the support we deserve.\u201d The government has said its aim was to create \u201ca nation more resilient to future flood and coastal erosion risk\u201d, but the report found there was no numerical target in place, meaning it could not quantify how much progress was being made on this.",

        "body": "The oil company BP has appointed its former chief financial officer, Murray Auchincloss, as its new chief executive after the shock departure of Bernard Looney last year. BP said Auchincloss, who has acted as interim chief executive since September, would take up the permanent role with immediate effect. He succeeds Looney, who stepped down after failing to disclose to the board personal relationships with colleagues. The appointment brings to an end a \u201crobust and competitive search process\u201d that many believed would lead to the oil supermajor\u2019s first external chief executive hire in its history. Auchincloss, a 53-year-old Canadian national, joined BP when it took over the oil company Amoco in 1998 and has been on the board since he became chief financial officer four years ago. In his new role he will take home an annual salary of \u00a31.45m before pension and bonus opportunities. He reportedly competed for the role against Carol Howle, BP\u2019s head of trading and shipping, and Emma Delaney, the head of customers and products. The chief executive of BAE Systems, Charles Woodburn, was also reportedly linked to the role. Helge Lund, the BP chair, said: \u201cSince September, BP\u2019s board has undertaken a thorough and highly competitive process to identify BP\u2019s next CEO, considering a number of high-calibre candidates in detail. The board is in complete agreement that Murray was the outstanding candidate and is the right leader for BP. \u201cMany already know Murray well, and few know BP better than he does. His assured leadership, focus on performance and delivery, and deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the energy transition will serve BP well as we continue our disciplined transformation to an integrated energy company.\u201d Auchincloss said: \u201cOur strategy \u2013 from international oil company to integrated energy company, or IOC to IEC \u2013 does not change. I\u2019m convinced about the significant value we can create. \u201cNow, more than ever, our focus must remain on delivery \u2013 operating safely and efficiently, executing with discipline, and always focusing on returns. This is how we will deliver real benefits for our customers and other stakeholders and continue to grow long-term value for BP\u2019s shareholders.\u201d Looney became the third of BP\u2019s last four bosses to leave the role abruptly when he announced his decision to step down with immediate effect last September. BP said Looney had admitted that he had not been \u201cfully transparent in his previous disclosures\u201d about personal relationships with colleagues, and \u201caccepts he was obligated to make more complete disclosure\u201d.",

        "body": "In the 1970s Kenneth MacMillan snatched ballet from the land of myths and fairytales and thrust it into worlds of psychological darkness, with complex, unsympathetic characters that dancers love to get their teeth into. Does Manon, a ballet about prostitution and sexual violence, come dangerously close to misery porn? In the lower rungs of 18th-century Paris, women are bought and abused, the society on show is an ugly one, but this is ballet so it\u2019s also beautiful: I think that\u2019s called cognitive dissonance. Manon is full of dislikable characters, and its success hinges on whether the dancers can engross us in their journey. Opening night features two of the Royal Ballet\u2019s strongest actors, Francesca Hayward and Gary Avis, as well as Marcelino Samb\u00e9 making his debut as pure-hearted Des Grieux, so the answer is yes. The real theme is power. There\u2019s the guileless power of youthful femininity that Manon (Hayward) doesn\u2019t even realise she has, radiating goodness and beauty that others want to leech. There\u2019s the power that comes with money, obviously. Monsieur GM (Avis) is the kind of guy who likes to throw a handful of coins on the floor and laugh as desperate souls scramble for them. But how the balance subtly tips when he shows his interest in Manon and suddenly he wants her too much (Avis is excellent at being creepy, rubbing his face against her satin shoe). She\u2019s frozen with confusion and discomfort but quickly realises her currency. In a clever pas de trois she is pimped by her own brother (Alexander Campbell, very good) who lifts her legs in arabesques over Monsieur GM\u2019s head and the question of who is in control is ever changing. Later, lavishly dressed, Hayward carries herself like a queen, but Manon\u2019s power is an illusion and we see just how far she falls. Whatever your feeling about the content, the craft is consummate: MacMillan\u2019s pas de deux packed with inventive, unexpected steps and lifts; the insatiability of young love captured in sweeping phrases that don\u2019t stop to breathe. The whole company is on strong form and Samb\u00e9 remains ardent to the end, but swallowed by this snake pit of a society. \u2022 At the Royal Opera House, London, until 8 March",

        "body": "When MaryKat joined a high school in her home town of Kansas City making close friends didn\u2019t come as easily as she\u2019d hoped. \u201cI felt a bit alone when I started,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t really enjoy the first year that much. I was still trying to find my way and discover what I was passionate about.\u201d During the summer after freshman year, she was invited to a get-together at the local swimming pool. \u201cWhen I arrived, I saw Averie. We had some mutual friends but I didn\u2019t know her at all,\u201d she says. Nobody else showed up, and MaryKat admits she wanted to escape the situation. \u201cI get social anxiety when it\u2019s just me with someone I don\u2019t know well.\u201d However, as soon as they started chatting, her worries disappeared. \u201cI was really excited to see MaryKat because it was someone new to speak to,\u201d says Averie. \u201cI\u2019d also come to the school not knowing many people and although I\u2019d spent all year trying to make friends and have fun, I hadn\u2019t really met anyone I was really close to.\u201d MaryKat says their shared school experience meant they had more in common than she expected and the conversation \u201cflowed easily\u201d. After a few hours at the pool, they spent the rest of the day together. \u201cI loved how easy-going she was and after that we started hanging out all the time,\u201d says Averie. As well as seeing each other at school, the pair enjoyed making mixed CDs together and both had their first jobs at the same ice-cream parlour. \u201cWe could drive at 14 with a permit, so we spent lots of time driving around together listening to music, which is the most midwest thing you can do,\u201d laughs MaryKat. \u201cWe also went to all our dances together, as well as teenage parties in cornfields.\u201d When they were 16, MaryKat\u2019s mother lost her job and the family relocated to South Carolina. \u201cI was able to stay with my cousin and complete high school,\u201d says MaryKat. \u201cAverie was there for me the whole time and I could always lean on her. When I was feeling lonely and missing my family, she looked out for me. My independence is now a major part of my personality and she helped me to develop that.\u201d After school, the pair went to different colleges, with MaryKat moving to South Carolina to study visual communications and German, and Averie attending university in Kansas to study business and French. When they graduated, Averie moved to New York to work in fashion merchandising while MaryKat travelled the world, working in communications for non-profit organisations. \u201cDuring the pandemic, we lived together for two years in New York,\u201d says Averie. While MaryKat has now returned to travelling around Europe with a refugee organisation, Averie has remained in New York and the pair don\u2019t go a day without talking. \u201cWe have also taken lots of trips together \u2013 she makes amazing itineraries,\u201d says MaryKat. \u201cI love skiing and hiking, while Averie likes the beach, but we always find a way to compromise.\u201d In recent years, they\u2019ve been to Denver, San Diego, Paris and London, and they\u2019re hoping to visit Croatia soon, too. They even enjoy the downsides of travelling together. \u201cWhen we went to London at new year, we couldn\u2019t get a taxi and ended up walking barefoot in the cold for an hour because our shoes hurt so much,\u201d says Averie. \u201cWith anyone else it would have been horrible but she makes these experiences fun.\u201d Averie also appreciates her friend\u2019s caring nature. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to MaryKat that her work helps people and that\u2019s a really admirable trait,\u201d she says. \u201cShe makes everyone feel comfortable and at ease.\u201d For MaryKat, opposites definitely attract. \u201cShe\u2019s into fashion; I\u2019m very much not and she has to help me figure out what to wear. She loves hot weather; I love being in cold climates. But we share the same political values and loyalty is really important to us,\u201d she says. \u201cAverie gives people the best advice and she\u2019s really good at being objective. She makes me want to be a better person.\u201d",

        "body": "This is an intriguing, eclectic programme from the soprano Ruby Hughes and a string quartet from the Manchester Collective, led by her childhood friend Rakhi Singh. Music of quiet stillness, often nodding to folk or spiritual traditions, dominates early on, with Hughes\u2019s voice closely captured. There is, however, a sudden burst of instrumental energy from Caroline Shaw\u2019s Valencia, which captures the exuberant potential of the tiny capsules of juice in an orange segment. Overall, the music takes us from uncertainty to a kind of acceptance. Vaughan Williams\u2019s Along the Field hangs in the air like a spider\u2019s web, at once impossibly vulnerable and strongly sustained. Between three of John Tavener\u2019s Akhmatova Songs and Ravel\u2019s Kaddisch come David Bruce\u2019s imaginative arrangements of two Dowland songs, Hughes\u2019s delivery taking an emphatic turn. There\u2019s a kind of culmination in the title track, a 1994 song by Errollyn Wallen that hits an exultant if fleeting climax. Then the harmonic complexities of Debussy\u2019s Trois Chansons de Bilitis, seamlessly arranged by Jake Heggie, make a refreshing bridge to the final two songs. It\u2019s not easy for any composer to follow Mahler\u2019s Urlicht, performed here with careful intensity, but Deborah Pritchard\u2019s specially commissioned song Peace makes an effective valediction in the context.",

        "body": "I come across the words \u201cBig JOY\u201d while idly scrolling on my phone one morning and it stops me in my tracks. It\u2019s the name: both funny and audacious (is an insidious joy industry manipulating us into bliss?). Who\u2019s considering even medium-sized joy, when the horror of world events unfolds around us hourly? But finding joy in hard times, personal or global, is precisely the point of Big JOY, a citizen science project based at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Anyone can take part \u2013 it requires a time commitment of just seven minutes a day for seven days, with easy activities that studies suggest are likely to increase positive emotions. The premise is that we can work out what makes us feel good and do more of it. \u201cMicro-acts of joy focus us on what is good about the life in front of us, and how we can make it better,\u201d says Elissa Epel, a psychiatry professor at the University of California, San Francisco and author of The Seven-Day Stress Prescription, who is a collaborator on the Big JOY project. \u201cThis is critical during these dark times; these are ways we bring in the light.\u201d More than 88,000 people in 208 countries have tried Big JOY since it launched in November 2021 \u2013 and that number now includes me. I\u2019m not naturally overflowing with joy; no one has ever mistaken me for a ray of sunshine. But I turn 50 this year and learning to squeeze more joy from life feels increasingly urgent. I\u2019m not optimistic (obviously) that a week of \u201cmicro-acts\u201d is the answer, but I\u2019m ready to give Big JOY a chance. Day 0: Getting started Once I\u2019ve signed up, my week kicks off with an exhortation to listen to a recording of people laughing. I don\u2019t enjoy this: it feels overblown and fake like a sitcom laugh track. What the hell do you all have to laugh about (yes, even you, the baby at the end)? I also complete a questionnaire that goes alarmingly deep, asking me to assess whether I am \u201csatisfied with my life as a whole\u201d, whether I\u2019ve felt \u201ccontent with my relationships and friendships\u201d this week and how much common humanity I feel with others. Yikes. I understand it\u2019s about working out a baseline, though, and I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s to come. Day 1: Celebrate another\u2019s joy A Big JOY email delivers my first challenge. Choose a person, or people, in my life and \u201cplan to ask this person to tell you about something fun, wonderful or inspiring that they\u2019ve experienced, or that has made them feel proud recently\u201d. I try it at choir. Helen tells me about holding her brand-new first granddaughter in her arms in December; Cristina observed a goldcrest sitting on a bare branch; and Anna says she felt joy when we started singing a Welsh folk song. \u201cThere\u2019s something quite special and rare about a group of people coming together to make music,\u201d she reminds me. It\u2019s touching how openly and sincerely my choir mates engage with the exercise and I love hearing what has made them joyful. Big JOY suggests I nod, smile and say stuff like: \u201cThat must have felt great!\u201d but I am not American, so I don\u2019t; my smile is absolutely real though. Full disclosure: I also find myself telling a sad anecdote about a dead goldcrest, which absolutely no one needed to hear. When prompted to do my late-night check-in \u2013 Big JOY asks you to rate your mood straight after the mission and again at the end of the day \u2013 I\u2019m on a high. I rate this as something I\u2019d like to do again and I do: I start asking my friends whenever I can. I learn about the fun and wonder they\u2019ve got, variously, from singing to a cat, a fulfilling new job, \u201choliday sex with a Canadian oncologist\u201d (\u201cThat must have felt great!\u201d I consider and reject saying) and a Sesame Street documentary. Day 2: You are a force of good The demonstrably incorrect title of day 2 makes me frown when it appears in my inbox. Before I can explore further, however, I complete my morning check-in. The questions are the same morning and night: to what extent I\u2019m feeling \u201cpleasant emotions like delight, pride or hope\u201d and then separately how much I\u2019m feeling \u201cunpleasant emotions like distress, sadness or anger\u201d. It\u2019s hard but interesting, splitting my emotions into positive and negative rather than just a muddy wash of anxiety-tinged blah-ness. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful for our own self-knowledge and also for the scientific study that we become aware of all our feelings,\u201d the Big JOY Q&amp;A explains. The task is to listen to a Buddhist prayer \u2013 apparently one of the Dalai Lama\u2019s faves \u2013 reciting along if you wish. There is a sort-of spiritual context to Big JOY; the original idea came from Mission: Joy, a documentary featuring the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu, about finding joy in troubled times. The prayer is performed by Sah D\u2019Simone, bestselling author of Spiritually Sassy, dance healer and guru for Channel 4\u2019s Big Celebrity Detox. (Yes, I go down a deep Google hole on the amazing-sounding D\u2019Simone to put off listening.) I recite along although I\u2019m deeply sceptical. The prayer suggests that \u201cby virtue of my merits\u201d amazing things will happen in the world, the blind will see, the poor find wealth and the thirsty find \u201cdelicious drinks\u201d. It feels silly. But when I reach the last section about remaining to \u201cdispel the miseries of the world\u201d, I find myself crying. How can I be a \u201cforce of good\u201d? I feel utterly powerless. Day 3: Shift your perspective Today I have to think of a time recently I felt \u201cfrustrated, anxious or upset\u201d (it would be harder to think of a time I\u2019m not), then \u201ctake a deep, slow breath\u201d and write three positive things that came out of it. It takes me a while to settle on something: I can\u2019t see an upside to being impersonated by online scammers, getting ringworm or becoming frighteningly incapacitated with anxiety over the summer, so I decide to focus on my dog\u2019s death (at which point, I confess I\u2019m questioning when the joy bit starts). I take my deep breath and remember how close I felt to my husband as he cried next to me. I remember how writing about the experience connected me to people who had been through similar things. Then I think how often I still mention losing Oscar to strangers, months later. Just this week I had a surprisingly long and deep conversation in Waterstones with a woman and her sausage dog about grief (mainly the woman \u2013 the sausage dog was trying to eat a plush avocado). There\u2019s something about the universality of loss that makes it a powerful force for connection, I suppose. Cheery. Day 4: Make a gratitude list Ah, this old chestnut. It\u2019s on here for good reasons, I know. \u201cStudies show that exercising gratitude can lead to more optimism about life, increased physical comfort and better health, quicker recovery from stressful and upsetting events, higher quantity and quality of friendships,\u201d Big JOY explains. A meta-review of 70 studies of gratitude research in 2021 concluded that \u201cindividuals who experience more gratitude have lower levels of depression\u201d. I have never tried, so I give it a sincere go. I\u2019m grateful for my home and the deep peace it affords me. I\u2019m grateful for my affectionate and endlessly tolerant husband, a best friend who makes my life better every day, the opportunity to watch my sons become interesting adults and for the people I know who work in small ways to make the world around us better. Also my chickens. I\u2019m really grateful for chickens. Thankfully I don\u2019t have to rank which I\u2019m most grateful for. Day 5: Dwell in awe Awe can make us feel more connected and compassionate and can increase feelings of physical and mental wellbeing. Unfortunately, as I tackle this nature-based awe exercise \u2013 watching a video of Yosemite \u2013 a worrying work issue crops up that sends me spiralling. The footage is very beautiful, but it barely registers with my heart thudding and palms sweating. But dwelling in awe is one thing I know how to do, and it doesn\u2019t happen in front of my laptop. I go into the garden and sit quietly on the ground. A robin comes very close to observe me; long-tailed tits flit around the feeders; the light is beautiful. Suburban York is no Yosemite; but it takes me out of my own exhausting head and gives me a fraction more perspective on my work problems. Day 6: Tune in to what matters Today I am supposed to rate values \u2013 virtue, fairness, goodwill and unity \u2013 and explain how they \u201cinform and shape your day-to-day experiences\u201d. At this point I start feeling slightly mutinous: I thought I was signing up for seven days of joy-inducing challenges (cuddle a baby, stroke a puppy, eat a cake, splash in a puddle, that sort of thing); instead I\u2019m getting homework. I dutifully rate my values and spend some time feeling bad at how little I actually embody them. It\u2019s not sparking joy. \u201cA micro-act of JOY that doesn\u2019t result in JOY for you doesn\u2019t mean anything negative about YOU, you wonderful human,\u201d Big JOY says, reassuringly. As a reward for slogging through it, I go and do something that reliably brings me joy: playing with my hens. When I do my mood check-ins, I\u2019m struck at how often I find I am scoring myself above average on both positive and negative emotions, rather than all one way or the other. I\u2019m always anxious, but on closer examination, I\u2019m also contented. I think this gets to the kernel of what Big JOY is teaching: identifying or finding joy amid negative emotions and experiences. Day 7: Do something kind Doing something kind, my last challenge, feels manageable until I read the small print: I\u2019m supposed to identify five separate people and a kind thing to do for them. Who am I, Am\u00e9lie Poulain? I don\u2019t even see five people most days. On closer reading I don\u2019t have to do all the acts immediately; just think about them. OK: I will darn my husband\u2019s jumper that he keeps showing me, hopefully, and I keep ignoring. I will send a friend a care package, return a forgotten item to a colleague, give a compliment and drop some groceries at the food bank. I make a start, and the to-do-list-ticking aspect of trotting off to the post office and food bank feels good. However I also shame myself for not having enough social contact to make this task easy, and not doing small kindnesses spontaneously more often. The verdict Following a final check-in, I unlock my \u201cpersonalised joy report\u201d. Cheeringly, my wellbeing has gone up 14.13%. Predictably for me, that\u2019s lower than the average, based on the project\u2019s interim findings, which showed an increase of 23%. \u201cThis was a much larger effect than we expected,\u201d Epel says. \u201cWe found people increase in their positive emotions immediately and in feelings of flourishing by end of the week.\u201d It wasn\u2019t universal, however, she explains, and the next phase of the project will involve delving into the data to explore why. Participants are also volunteers, of course, so probably inclined to be receptive; there\u2019s a further study in the works that will test how Big JOY works in controlled conditions. The report also confirms what I felt: that what made me happiest were the tasks involving other people. Epel says her experience has been the same. \u201cThe prosocial interventions help me the most, and that\u2019s no surprise ... happiness research suggests that kind acts for others are a powerful way to increase the subtle but lasting feelings of happiness.\u201d So have I embiggened my joy over seven days? Good question. Big JOY wasn\u2019t the barrel of cartwheeling, kitten-kissing laughs I had hoped, but I think it\u2019s given me something deeper: a reminder of how happy other people (not just hens) make me, especially if I can make them feel good too. The conclusion seems to be that to feel more joy, I need to become a more connected, outward-looking person, ruminate less and focus on finding ways, however small, of doing good in the world. Hmm. I have a funny feeling that was Big JOY\u2019s dastardly plan all along. \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "body": "Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfield Penguin, $22.99 I loved Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld this year. Does what it says on the tin but also clever and zeitgeist-y with a nice take on the pandemic \u2013 among its many horrors, it gave some people a chance to step off the hamster wheel and refocus on their relationships. I think this is an important part of the pandemic story but understandably gets lost among bigger, negative themes. Sittenfeld\u2019s back catalogue is also brilliant and in particular I recommend Rodham, which reimagines Hillary Clinton\u2019s life if she had ditched Bill early on. \u2013 Hepcat1 Dimension of Miracles by Robert Sheckley Penguin, $22.99 For fans of Douglas Adams I\u2019d recommend looking up the works of Robert Sheckley, starting with Dimension of Miracles. Written in 1968, this is a brilliant satire which still hits most of its targets today. Adams hadn\u2019t read any Sheckley before writing his own novels, but there are certainly similarities in tone, content and humour between the two. \u2013 nilpferd The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid by Bill Bryson Penguin, $24.99 I remember my raucous, unseemly and uncontrolled laughter when reading Bill Bryson\u2019s memoir about his childhood. Crying laughter. And this was on a plane and it was one of those \u201cwhat\u2019s he laughing about\u201d moments. This is his account of seeing an adult coming to grief after diving off a high board: He fell with flawless grace for what seemed whole minutes. Such was the beauty of the moment, and the breathless silence of the watching multitudes, that the only sound to be heard across the lake was the faint whistle of his body tearing through the air towards the water far, far below. It may only be my imagination, but he seemed after a time to start to glow red, like an incoming meteor. He was really moving. \u2013 NiallConnolly Would That Be Funny? by Lorin Clarke Text, $35 Not rolling-about funny but I found much to smile at when reading Lorin Clarke\u2019s 2023 memoir about her father, comedian John Clarke. For those who still smile at recalling episodes of Clarke and Dawe, this book is a charmer. \u2013 MJMI My Name is Barbra by Barbra Streisand Penguin, $75 Streisand is a one-of-a-kind talent who overcame a difficult childhood, a jealous, unsupportive mother and seemingly teams of men who tried to obstruct her vision and control her when she wouldn\u2019t succumb. When singing with a symphony orchestra, she heard a wrong note, questioned the music, was condescended to and ignored again. When they finally checked the score that note was found to be incorrectly transcribed. She broke through so many ceilings in the film industry. Amazing life. \u2013 tonimaccer The Book of Sand by Theo Clare Penguin, $22.99 The sadly late Mo Hayder (writing as Theo Clare) wrote this book set in an alternative universe, and is somewhere between fantasy, sci-fi and mystery. The world and its disparate family of occupants is beautifully realised and the novel completely intrigues. There are rumours that a second, posthumous novel, The Book of Clouds, is planned for release. \u2013 squidlet1 Shy by Mary Rodgers and Jesse Green Hachette, $55 The best celebrity memoir of recent times is Shy: The Alarmingly Outspoken Memoirs of Mary Rodgers. Composer of note from a family of composers: daughter of Richard Rodgers, mother to Adam Guettel, friend to Stephen Sondheim (among many others). Smart, gossipy, wonderfully self-deprecating and often laugh-out-loud hilarious. \u2013 ozjosh Bryant &amp; May series by Christopher Fowler Penguin, $22.99 I highly recommend the Bryant &amp; May novels by Christopher Fowler (who sadly died last year). The title characters are London\u2019s two oldest serving policemen, part of the Peculiar Crimes squad, tasked with investigating odd, unorthodox crimes. Extremely entertaining, often quite humorous (though at times grim \u2013 they\u2019re certainly not \u201ccozy\u201d mysteries) and always full of fascinating details about London and its history. Given how cool, wet and miserable this summer has been in my part of Australia, I feel right at home re-reading them! \u2013 Sockamagee Space by Stephen Baxter HarperCollins, $22.99 Space spans a period from present day until the year 8800 AD and beyond. The book starts with the discovery of aliens and, over the next 6,000 years, the Baxter explores first contact as well as the human colonisation of various moons and planets. The destruction then re-engineering of Earth\u2019s atmosphere is written about in great detail. I find that the detail that Baxter goes into extremely fascinating, believable and beautiful \u2013 like a chapter where a human explores Venus for the first time, describing how the rocks glow an eerily beautiful red and how moving on the surface is like wading through water. Breathtaking. \u2013 PAC1979 Case Histories by Kate Atkinson Penguin, $22.99 Atkinson\u2019s Jackson Brodie series is dark, funny and clever. You follow Brodie, a PI, as well as the trajectory of minor characters who become major players in the following books. Atkinson is a brilliant writer. Start with book one: Case Histories. \u2013 tonimaccer Mordant\u2019s Need series by Stephen Donaldson Hachette, $7.99 (ebook) Ah, fantasy. I enjoy it but find that sorcery, it seems, does not lend itself to brevity. In that spirit, may I recommend the mercifully brief and eminently readable Mordant\u2019s Need series by Stephen Donaldson. It spans a total of two books, features a heroine whose story arc extends beyond tired girl power tropes, and it has one of the best finales I\u2019ve read. \u2013 TheBaronVonTiki Harpo Speaks! by Harpo Marx Rowman &amp; Littlefield, US$27.99 Try this autobiography of Harpo Marx, co-written with Rowland Barber. You do not need to be a Marx brothers fan; in fact their movies barely get mentioned. It\u2019s the many famous people that he managed to meet and interact with that make this a truly memorable book. \u2013 woollcott Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The Professor by Lauren Nossett Macmillan, $12.99 The Professor is Nossett\u2019s sequel to her debut, The Resemblance. You can see the slight Donna Tartt/Tana French influence as former detective Marlitt Kaplan goes undercover to live with university students to clear a professor being investigated under a Title IX complaint about a student who died by suicide at a US university. It\u2019s tense as hell and my jaw dropped right up until the final line. \u2013 Sikonat My Life and Hard Times by James Thurber HarperCollins, US$14.99 I recently reread this one. Surprised and delighted that something which reduced me to tears of laughter as a teenager is just as funny half a century on. \u2013 Bibliobat Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erikson Penguin, $22.99 Fourteen-odd years ago my brother bought me two books for my birthday. As a lapsed fantasy fan, I was a little nonplussed, but I very quickly got into the first, which was a small, underground novel called Game of Thrones. You may have heard of it. It was the other book, though, that has stayed with me longer. Gardens of the Moon, the first of a 10-part series, is not an easy read and shouldn\u2019t be anyone\u2019s first fantasy book. But the series as a whole is so vast and operatic I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend it to anyone who feels they can take on 10 very, very big books. I\u2019m on a second read of the series now and it\u2019s really rewarded me. \u2013 grafhamboy Readers\u2019 comments have been edited for length and clarity",

        "body": "On the edge of Borough Market, hiding slightly up a back lane and away from the \u00a312 aubergines, the pork chops that come with CVs and the madding foodie crowds clutching their spirulina smoothies, is a new west African restaurant, Akara. Once upon a time, Borough Market was a weekend affair, but now it\u2019s a genteel, organic sort of bedlam every single day. It\u2019s the perfect place to open somewhere like Akara, the second restaurant from Aji Akokomi, who in 2020 opened Akoko, a fine-dining excursion around the owner\u2019s west African heritage that, to my mind, is well worthy of a Michelin star. Akara is Akoko\u2019s more casual younger sibling, a place where newbies to west African cuisine can dangle a toe, while more well-versed diners can come to judge the chef\u2019s take on efik coconut rice in a smart, beautifully lit industrial-chic space. Actual akara are, of course, on the menu, too. They could, roughly speaking, be called fritters, though I\u2019d compare them more to fried fairy cakes \u2013 spongey, golden, almost resembling financiers, although in truth these particular buns, which inspired the Brazilian street-food snack, the acaraj\u00e9, are made from loved and much-laboured-over black-eye beans. The beans are soaked, shelled, whisked, pulverised and transformed into a light batter before being deep-fried until golden. In the wrong hands (namely, my clumsy shovels), akara would be a disaster, but here they are plump, voluptuous and stuffed with the likes of sweet, spiced barbecued tiger prawns, soft, yielding braised ox cheek, barbecued wild mushrooms or a seared hand-dived Orkney scallop. Each akara comes in its own little box, so don\u2019t order them to share, as we did. They are best tackled with both hands and accompanied by the house scotch-bonnet soda, a non-alcoholic beverage offering all the elegance of a cool, clear, long soda with a heat rating of about 200,000 units on the Scoville scale. We visited on a midweek lunchtime, when the place was pleasingly busy, possibly because so many of London\u2019s smart restaurants don\u2019t seem to open until Wednesday evenings at the moment. As a result, Akara was packed with solo food obsessives photographing their lunches and smart business groups enjoying the plantain old fashioneds, the cacao and date negronis and the short wine list. The food is hearty rather than fancy; if, for example, you order the Lagos chicken from the larger plates section of the menu, what turns up is a whole, splayed, spatchcocked poussin drizzled with vibrant orange sosu kaani, a Senegalese hot sauce singing with habanero chilli peppers and garlic. There\u2019s also grilled pollock with a yassa sauce made from deeply caramelised onion and lemon, and a vegan dish of grilled cabbage in carrot sauce and herby oil. This isn\u2019t stand-on-ceremony food, this is a dig-in type of dinner \u2013 although your servers will happily explain the cooking process if you ask them to. The standout dish for me was a side of fried plantain with octopus, served in a curiously delicate and deft way, and made lively with pepper relish. The efik rice is pale, having been simmered in chicken broth and coconut, and, if you like, comes topped with seared mackerel. If you want something green on the table to make you feel healthy, there is a salad of baby gem, crisp shallots and spiced peanuts to pair with your Senegalese-sauced poussin. This is a confident restaurant taking its first tottering steps, offering modern, playful, imaginative riffs on food that clearly means so much to Akokomi. It is no small feat to trailblaze in this way, bringing much-loved dishes to an audience that may never have eaten them before, and hoping both to delight and to broaden horizons. Akoko, for me, was groundbreaking, and the more casual, everyday Akara is a spiriting slice of joy for London\u2019s dining scene. We finished with tamarind date sponge cake with tonka bean cream, which was kind of inevitable from the moment I saw it on the menu, because I am rather fixated by the richness of the tonka bean and the slightly macabre aspect that, in the wrong hands, it can be poisonous; in fact, it has been banned in the US since 1954 due to, ahem, casualties. I trusted Akara not to kill me, though. Let\u2019s face it, the paperwork would be arduous. Less brave sorts can go for the coconut and lime sorbet, which is a citric blast to send you on your way feeling fully awakened. Akara is worth visiting if only for the dish the place is named after. Be honest, you\u2019re never going to shell those black-eye beans yourself. Akara Arch 208, 18 Stoney Street, London SE1, 020-3861 5190. Open Tues-Sat, lunch noon-4pm, dinner 6-11pm. From about \u00a340 a head, plus drinks and service",

        "body": "The late great improviser/composer Kenny Wheeler once reported to the Guardian that what he liked doing best was \u201cwriting sad tunes, and then letting wonderful musicians destroy them\u201d. The New York guitarist and new-music original Mary Halvorson (who, like Wheeler, was once a receptive disciple in the challenging bands of veteran boundary-buster Anthony Braxton) has also made a home in the turbulently dreamlike spaces where composition and the whims of improv meet. Lessons learned as a live improviser and off-stage as an imaginative student of musical form have created the rare artist she\u2019s become. In 2022, Halvorson\u2019s already exalted reputation took a new leap with Amaryllis and Belladonna, albums respectively angled toward improv and written chamber music. Now comes Cloudward, a superb eight-piece set (reflecting in its title and moods the composer\u2019s sense of liberation at the then-receding pandemic) for her sextet, joining guitar and Patricia Brennan\u2019s vibraphone with trumpet, trombone, bass and drums, and the legendary Laurie Anderson on effects-violin for one track. The slowly mounting brass-and-vibes fanfare of The Gate conceals the groove of the building bassline and softly hustling drums that eventually emerge, while trumpeter Adam O\u2019Farrill \u2013 secure and clean-toned all over the horn\u2019s range \u2013 shares beautifully interwoven brass harmonies with trombonist Jacob Garchik on Collapsing Mouth and Unscrolling. The latter is bookended by quiet drum rolls and glittering cymbal flickers, and a contrastingly dark, slithery bowed-bass breakout late on. Halvorson throws distorted guitar into the avant-funky Desiderata; Anderson sketches bugged violin sounds from brass tones to chimes into the graceful arcs of Incarnadine; and the almost Latin jazz-like Tailhead sets exhilarating band-riffing behind the climbing, twisting melody. Halvorson\u2019s fusions of written and spontaneous music reach an entrancing new seamlessness and seductive warmth with this terrific set. Also out this month Much-acclaimed young American vibraphonist Joel Ross releases Nublues (Blue Note) with regular bandmates including gospel-fuelled saxist Immanuel Wilkins. They put orthodox and unorthodox angles on the blues in an occasionally solemn but mostly vibrant tracklist featuring seven originals alongside an implacably grooving account of John Coltrane\u2019s Equinox and a playfully inquisitive one of Thelonious Monk\u2019s Evidence. New York percussionist, vibraphonist and composer Ches Smith, a virtuoso of free-jazz, Haitian Vodou music, electronics and more, unveils Laugh Ash (Pyroclastic Records) \u2013 minimalism, spoken word, free-jazz tenor sax, abstract electronics, and gracefully close-knit chamber music intertwine on the prolific Smith\u2019s most genre-inclusive release yet. And the melodically freewheeling American tenorist Rich Halley, an unjustly close-kept secret beyond his native Oregon, delivers a scalding postbop-to-free reminder of his long-honed eloquence in a formidable quartet including masterly post-Cecil Taylor pianist Matthew Shipp on Fire Within (Pine Eagle Records).",

        "body": "Whatever the marketing bumf says, true and meaningful innovation in beauty is infrequent. But for 2024 I\u2019m buzzing to tell you about two innovations that I believe could and should change how many of us buy makeup. Here\u2019s how foundation is usually sold: brands attempt to anticipate which skin shades will prove useful and popular, manufacture accordingly, then rely on customers and staff to choose the right ones and minimise wasted stock. But genius British brand Dcypher rejects this process. Instead, it relies on AI (I know, but stay with me) to analyse your skin tone using a 60-second online process, and then custom-blends your unique shade to order (\u00a342). This results in zero surplus stock and packaging, and no excess freight and storage. No one can be more astonished than I am that it truly, brilliantly, works. Unlike other online colour matching brands, which tweak one generic foundation, Dcypher allowed me to choose my coverage level and finish, and combined these with my AI-generated shade, which was absolutely spot on. Try it \u2013 I\u2019ll be amazed if you have cause to use their free adjustment service. Whether you\u2019re vegan or not, you may be disgusted to learn that the vast majority of vibrant red lipsticks are made from carmine, a pigment extracted from female beetles. Up to 1,000 of them are sun-dried and crushed to create just one lipstick. The same process is followed for bright red paints, fabric dyes and medications, as well as many foods and drinks, and it is widely accepted that nothing else works as well in delivering rich, vivid reds. Vegan red lipsticks do exist (though they\u2019re often the only non-vegan lipstick in a shade lineup, so do check), but they lack the brilliance and saturation of carmine reds. Carisa Janes, founder of Hourglass Cosmetics, rejected the industry standard and, after three years\u2019 research alongside parent company Unilever, has developed Confession Red 0, a refillable, 100% vegan, patent-pending lipstick for which not a single insect was harmed. This is a true, rich, fire engine-red in a slim bullet for sharp application. It\u2019s pricey at \u00a335, but both packaging and formula feel suitably luxurious, and the innovative technology will probably, over time, trickle down into the mainstream.",

        "body": "Why will I love it? The bamboo orchid (Dendrobium nobile) is a delicate masterpiece. Its arching canes and fragrant, waxy blooms in pink, purple or white bring a touch of the tropics indoors. Light or shade? It thrives in bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can cause leaf scorch. Where should I put it? This beauty will feel at home near an east- or west-facing bathroom window, where it can luxuriate in higher humidity levels, mimicking its natural habitat. How do I keep it alive? Try to recreate its rainforest home by maintaining a stable environment with temperatures of about 18-24C and regularly misting its leaves. Keep the soil moist, but refrain from waterlogging it. During winter, allow the top inch of potting mix to dry between waterings. In its active growth period, from spring to early autumn, feed with orchid fertiliser every two to four weeks. Did you know \u2026 The bamboo orchid\u2019s botanical name means \u201ctree life\u201d, which refers to its epiphytic nature (growing on another plant). Beyond its aesthetic allure, it is used in traditional Chinese medicine, to promote wellness and soothe ailments.",

Arthur Darvill (Doctor Who) brings a smart balance of neurosis and warmth to his reading of Andy, who is devastated when Jen announces she is leaving him.

        "body": "History is not exactly littered with glittering Indiana Jones video games. The beautiful LucasArts adventure, The Fate of Atlantis; the pretty good Lego games; the decent Emporer\u2019s Tomb; the presentable SNES side-scroller, Greatest Adventures \u2026 There have been good games, but few classics that transcend the brand like, say, Knights of the Old Republic. Maybe that\u2019s about to change. During Microsoft\u2019s latest Developer Direct online event, streamed on Thursday evening, we saw a 12-minute preview of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a globe-trotting first-person adventure, set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade. The project was revealed three years ago, but this is the first footage we\u2019ve seen, and it\u2019s promising stuff. It has Nazis, it has a whip, it has Dr Jones in deserts, in tombs and arguing with Denholm Elliott in fusty college buildings; and it has a story involving a stolen artefact that is somehow linked to an international network of ancient monuments all of which align with a circle spanning the world. Interestingly, a lot of the lengthy promo video shown during the event is given over to the developer MachineGames explaining why the game uses the first-person perspective. \u201cOur game is all about putting you in Indie\u2019s shoes, letting you see what he sees and feel what he feels,\u201d says senior narrative designer Edward Curtis-Sivess. \u201cFor us at MachineGames, we do that best in first-person. We believe being up close and personal to the adventure is key.\u201d The concern is possibly that the look of Indiana Jones is so iconic, fans will miss seeing him loping about on the screen. Indeed, the two major game franchises most in debt to Raiders of the Lost Ark \u2013 Uncharted and Tomb Raider \u2013 both use a third-person perspective to mimic the cinematic feel of the Indy series. Indeed this game is going to have a hell of a job crawling out from beneath the legacies of those two franchises. They\u2019ve both done the cinematic puzzle-filled action-adventure genre, setting up many of its conventions. In The Great Circle, for example, Indy is accompanied by a headstrong journalist named Gina Lombardi, echoing Nathan Drake\u2019s partner in colonial crime, Elena Fisher. It also looks like there will be some environmental puzzles, with one section taking place in a tomb where stone cogs have to be placed, probably to open a door \u2013 which will look very familiar to anyone who\u2019s played, say, Uncharted 3, Tomb Raider: Anniversary or any number of Indiana Jones-inspired adventures. The video also promises multiple routes through major set-piece locations, with the opportunity to sneak about and study enemy patrol routes. Again, Nathan and Lara have been doing this for years. But this is MachineGames, which brilliantly rebooted the Wolfenstein series \u2013 it\u2019s a studio used to taking established concepts and adding a weird new spin. For those worried about not seeing Indie onscreen, this team brought real detail and character to the protagonist BJ Blazkowicz even though he\u2019s rarely seen in the game. And we are going to see Indy. The video stresses that the camera will pan out to third person at certain sections of the gameplay, and of course there\u2019s a very convincing Harrison Ford model present during the cut-scenes. The character is also being skilfully voiced by video game acting royalty, Troy Baker, best known as Joel from The Last of Us. What\u2019s more promising, however, is the implementation of classic Indy tropes. It looks like his whip can be used as a traversal device as well as a weapon, and we\u2019re getting authentic fistfights with those thundering punch sound effects. Plus, the hubristic Nazi antagonist Emmerich Voss is classic Indy fare. It\u2019s also great to see a role for horror movie stalwart Tony Todd who is seen at the beginning of the game stealing a seemingly minor artefact from Indy\u2019s workplace, Marshall College. It seems unfair that The Great Circle will have to fight with two games that have plundered the Indiana Jones treasury of ideas, images and action. But what it has, of course, is the Lucasfilm legacy \u2013 the character and his universe, the whip, that score and decades of goodwill. Plus MachineGames is a genuinely interesting studio not afraid of compelling, idiosyncratic ideas. If Indy is to triumph over his young usurpers, he\u2019ll need plenty of them. \u2022 Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is due for release later this year on Xbox and PC",

        "body": "Although Wonka is the undisputed king of the box office this winter, having earned \u00a356.1m since its release in mid-December, it\u2019s Anyone But You, a frothy romcom that recalls the genre\u2019s 2000s heyday, that\u2019s most surprised the film industry in recent weeks. Released last month, the Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell-starring film opened to meagre box office results in the US \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.7m) during its first weekend \u2013 and a fairly average \u00a31.2m in the UK. Since then, the film has shown surprisingly strong staying power, thanks largely to positive word of mouth, as well as the lack of winter films for female audiences. In its first three weeks at the UK box office, the film has continued to gross in the ballpark of its \u00a31.2m debut, a relatively uncommon box office phenomenon. In the US, it\u2019s shown even stronger performance, making nearly $10m (\u00a37.8m) in its third weekend, and outpacing its $6m debut in each subsequent weekend. Daniel Loria, SVP of film industry technology and data firm The Boxoffice Company, says that to see such strong week-on-week performance for \u201ca shopping mall multiplex title like this one is increasingly rare,\u201d citing 2022\u2019s indie sleeper hit Everything Everywhere All At Once as the most recent example. Since the advent of streaming, he says, studios have been reticent to give underperforming films a long life in cinemas. \u201cThis type of performance used to happen a lot more often, before there was a massive investment into streaming from a number of major studios,\u201d he says. \u201cSony doesn\u2019t have a streaming platform waiting for their content; it\u2019s a studio that still plays by the playbook that was successful for 100 years pre-pandemic.\u201d The success of Anyone But You is a glimmer of resurgence for the humble romcom, a genre that, for the better part of a decade, has been largely relegated to streaming services. Scott Meslow, author of From Hollywood With Love: The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of the Romantic Comedy, says the disappearance of romcoms from the big screen wasn\u2019t due to a lack of audience interest, but to big studios\u2019 increasing interest in high-budget \u201ctentpole\u201d films such as The Avengers and Avatar. \u201cWe were seeing a lot of $200m movies that might make a billion dollars, or a $10m movie given to an auteur that might win best picture at the Oscars,\u201d he says. \u201cIt used to be that there were lots of movies like a $20m romcom that could make $80m and that would be treated as a big success.\u201d The shift to big-budget action disproportionately affected films for female audiences \u2013 who, of course, weren\u2019t actually any less interested in films. Netflix, Meslow says, \u201crealised that romcoms they were licensing were wildly over-performing,\u201d and began putting their own into production. \u201cI talked to screenwriters who had romcoms that were sitting on the shelf for a decade that no one even wanted to take a look at. Suddenly it was \u2018Netflix wants to look at it Friday, and we\u2019ll have an option for you by Monday.\u2019\u201d Large studios, seeing the success of Netflix-produced films such as 2018\u2019s Set It Up, also starring Powell, have begun reinvesting in the genre, resulting in a spate of new romcoms since the pandemic, including The Lost City, starring Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum, and Ticket to Paradise, starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts, both released in 2022; and last year\u2019s No Hard Feelings, starring Jennifer Lawrence. Despite the presence of far bigger stars in these films, and far more widespread marketing campaigns, Anyone But You has already eclipsed No Hard Feelings\u2019 US box office, and will probably lap Ticket to Paradise in the US market soon too. Loria says that the release of Anyone But You in the middle of winter, with no significant competition for screens or audiences, is a crucial factor in its success. \u201cThere was no major holiday season blockbuster like Avatar or Spider-Man to take up screens,\u201d he says. \u201cA word-of-mouth title like Anyone But You has that extra opportunity to get extra showtimes and screenings, and has time to find audiences over subsequent weekends.\u201d Hannah Strong, digital editor at Little White Lies magazine, says Anyone But You is \u201cso representative of what audiences want \u2013 that kind of frothy, funny, easygoing film.\u201d She attributes the success of Anyone But You, in part, to the summer 2023 release of Barbie. \u201cI think post-Barbie, people realised they really liked going to the cinema, people that might have stopped during the pandemic, or people that don\u2019t go very often and are now feeling more catered to,\u201d she says. \u201cAnyone But You does serve that female demographic, who sometimes get a bit underserved by mainstream cinema.\u201d Anyone But You also features nudity and sex scenes \u2013 an aspect of mainstream cinema that\u2019s been eulogised just as much as the romcom. \u201cIt does serve an adult audience \u2013 it\u2019s this idea of a romcom being allowed to be sexy, and not being chaste and watered down,\u201d says Strong. \u201cThis is something that a lot of film-makers have talked about in the last few years \u2013 the idea of making films for adults is sometimes completely foreign to studios now. It feels like everyone is so nervous of doing anything that might upset someone [so] they end up coming up with these ideas that have no personality or depth.\u201d The film also has the benefit of bringing together Powell and Sweeney, whose stars have been on the rise since their appearances in Top Gun: Maverick and the HBO teen series Euphoria, respectively. While rumours of an on-set romance drummed up publicity for the film during its production, Strong says it\u2019s unlikely that tabloid gossip contributed to any genuine box office impact \u2013 an idea supported by the film\u2019s tepid first-week box office numbers in the US. Instead, Meslow says, Anyone But You\u2019s success can be chalked up to a good old fashioned Hollywood formula: \u201c[If] you find stars who are hot and want to do movies like this, and you put some actual marketing muscle behind it \u2013 and you made a good movie \u2013 people are going to see it.\u201d",

        "body": "A six-legged dog who was found abandoned in a car park has undergone surgery to remove her extra limbs. Ariel, a spaniel puppy, was found in Pembroke, Wales, in September last year and after a fundraising appeal was able to have surgery. The dog was taken in by the Greenacres Rescue charity, near Haverfordwest, and has been cared for by a foster family. She was named after the character from Disney\u2019s film The Little Mermaid because her partly fused extra back legs were said to resemble a mermaid\u2019s tail. Ariel, who was born with multiple birth defects, was operated on at Langford Vets small animal referral hospital in Somerset. A spokesperson for the charity said: \u201cHer additional limbs have been removed. Thankfully, having the CT [computerised tomography] images meant they did not discover anything unexpected, and although it wasn\u2019t a regular amputation, it was \u2018uneventful\u2019. \u201cWhen we spoke, she was in recovery, having lots of love and fuss from the nursing team but all be reassured she\u2019s doing well. We really hope she will now have an easy and quick recovery.\u201d Mikey Lawlor, the founder and manager of Greenacres Rescue, told the BBC: \u201cThere were two procedures which lasted about two hours, but both went fine. The next day she was up, walking around and eating and drinking. \u201cNow we just need to keep our fingers crossed she doesn\u2019t get any infections, but she really is in the best hands.\u201d It is hoped Ariel can be discharged this weekend to return home to her foster family in west Wales. \u201cThen, after she\u2019s had several weeks of physiotherapy and recovery, we\u2019ll see about finding her a forever home,\u201d Lawlor said. He told the BBC the response to Ariel\u2019s story had been \u201cincredible\u201d, with calls and emails from as far away as Australia. \u201cI just can\u2019t say enough of a thank you to everyone who\u2019s contributed to helping her,\u201d he said. Vicki Black, the Langford Vets hospital director, said: \u201cAriel was a complicated little dog whose care required close collaboration across a number of our specialist-led teams including orthopaedics, soft-tissue surgery, anaesthesia and radiology. \u201cWe are delighted such a lovely dog has recovered from her surgery well. As part of the University of Bristol, we are a centre committed to career-long learning and are proud to innovate and treat pets like Ariel. \u201cAriel deservedly has many devoted supporters. It was a great pleasure to treat her and work with Greenacres Rescue.\u201d",

        "body": "Country singer-songwriter Margo Price was born in Illinois in 1983 and studied dance and theatre at Northern Illinois University. For years, she was a fixture of the Nashville music scene, waiting tables and doing odd jobs while playing in various bands, before releasing her debut album, Midwest Farmer\u2019s Daughter, in 2016. In 2018, she was nominated for a best new artist Grammy and in 2022 published the memoir Maybe We\u2019ll Make It. Her fourth album, Strays, was released last year and she tours the UK and Ireland from 26 January (Gorilla, Manchester) to 30 January (Koko, London). 1. Film Killers of the Flower Moon (dir Martin Scorsese, 2023) I recently read David Grann\u2019s book: it\u2019s one of the saddest true stories I\u2019ve ever read and something more people should know about. Martin Scorsese\u2019s film was brilliant. It\u2019s about the Osage nation, a tribe of Native Americans living in 1920s Oklahoma who became the wealthiest people in the US, which attracted some pretty evil people. Lily Gladstone plays the lead and her performance was breathtaking. Fun fact: they asked me to audition for the role of Robert De Niro\u2019s wife. I didn\u2019t get it, obviously, but it was fun to be included. 2. Hobby The dulcimer I started playing the dulcimer about a year ago and it\u2019s been so fun. I started finding information online, figuring out chords, and I had one lesson, then I had the audacity to take this thing on tour with me and play it in front of people. It only has three strings and is actually quite easy to pick a melody out on. I see why Joni Mitchell would travel with one: it\u2019s small and lightweight, easier than lugging a guitar through an airport. I hope it inspires people over 40 to pick up a new instrument. 3. Podcast Ten Percent Happier The host, Dan Harris, was a news anchor but got out of the media after having a panic attack and struggling with substances. He describes himself as a \u201cfidgety sceptic\u201d but it\u2019s a Buddhist-leaning podcast: he interviews the Dalai Lama, monks, nuns and guests such as Esther Perel and La Sarmiento. He speaks to people who have been through some pretty terrible things and lived to tell about it, which gives me perspective. He seems like an honest person and has a dark, dry sense of humour. 4. Memoir Don\u2019t Tell Anybody the Secrets I Told You by Lucinda Williams I\u2019m a disciple of Lucinda Williams. For me, she\u2019s one of the greatest songwriters of our time. I listened to the audiobook because I love Lucinda\u2019s voice \u2013 I could hear her talk all day. I loved how upfront she was about her childhood, not having her mom in her life. It was an inspiring story because she did not reach the peak of her fame until she was 51. As women, we have this preconceived notion that it\u2019s all downhill after 30, so this made me have some wind in my sails and think that maybe I\u2019m just getting started. 5. Restaurant Bar Continental, Nashville I enjoy spending time at this restaurant, bar and vinyl listening room. My friend Sean Brock, who is a phenomenal chef and was a friend of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s, has really changed the restaurant game in this town. They have a great menu \u2013 they do a prime rib that they cut at the table \u2013 and wonderful mocktails. There is also an incredible sound system: recently they did a Willie Nelson night and a Dolly Parton dance party. They have these old speakers that were used to mix the Highwaymen\u2019s last album \u2013 it\u2019s a really cool little piece of Nashville history. 6. App Insight Timer I was having a really hard time sleeping: my body can be tired but it can be difficult for me to find stillness at the end of the night, so about six months ago I started using this app for sleep meditations. I just put in headphones and listen to a 10 to 20-minute meditation and it helps shut my mind down. It has definitely improved my sleep. I also enjoy the self-compassion meditations because I am my own worst critic. They keep me down to earth and off my phone, doom-scrolling at night.",

        "body": "It is hard to pinpoint a particular moment when I knew I loved Tim Lancaster from Tangambalanga (real place). When I first saw him looking at a dog? When he first draped a coat over my shoulders on a cold night? We met the traditional way: in a production of Legally Blonde the musical. I was playing Elle and he was playing Warner, the arsehole who breaks up with her and inspires her to get into Harvard Law School. (What, like it\u2019s hard?) Tale as old as time. We sang in harmony and laughed in dance rehearsals when I stepped on his feet. On closing night where there was one kiss in the script, I gave him two. And this is the moment. We stayed friends for a long time afterwards but the tides kept throwing us together. We texted about building the perfect fort to recapture our childhoods and, when we finally had our first date, he had transformed his room into my dream pillow fort. And this is the moment. I have felt limerence fizz in my arms when I\u2019ve been around men before, and it almost always led to heartbreak. So I tended to date men who didn\u2019t make me nervous. Men who made me feel safe. I didn\u2019t think it was possible to feel those two things at once around a person, until I met Tim. The first night we spent together, we woke up and he said: \u201cMaybe we should \u2026 \u201d and I was certain he is going to say, \u201cJust be friends.\u201d Instead, he suggested we stay at mine. It was 37C and I had better air con. And this is the moment. Now Tim and I share a home, a dog and a Netflix account, though I refuse to learn the password. We also work together, which should be a nightmare but isn\u2019t. It is rare to find a man in showbiz happy to be the wind beneath your wings. He plays guitar and characters in all my shows but never wants the spotlight himself. He\u2019s a rare find \u2013 an artist who genuinely just wants to do the job because it is a nice job to do. After every show people tell me they loved it but they really loved watching Tim watching me. \u201cYou can just see how much he loves you,\u201d they say, to which I want to reply: \u201cHe is a trained actor so he could just be very good at his job.\u201d Still, I\u2019ve never known a more generous man on or off stage. He smiles for photos on the red carpet and he warmly entertains the important people whose names I can\u2019t remember in theatre foyers. When my manager worries I might be burnt out, she asks Tim rather than me because he knows me better than I know myself. When I finish a season he tricks me into stopping and reflecting with a cup of tea and a bath. He is my assistant, my partner, my collaborator. My best friend (yuck!). And he is \u2013 most importantly \u2013 very silly. As I write this, he has come to interrupt me twice to show two versions of the lightning storm he\u2019s watching, through dance. He is not a dancer. When I am sure a new show is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever written, he looks me dead in the eyes and says: \u201cShut the fuck up and have fun.\u201d He holds my hand backstage before every opening night and helps me find my place when I lose my lines. He activates girly mode and gossips with my friends about their romantic escapades. He lets me blame my farts on our dog. These gentle, silly moments every day \u2013 these are when I know.

        "body": "Every day since arriving in Britain, Yvonne, a nurse in the NHS, has FaceTimed her two daughters back home in Zimbabwe. Often the calls end in tears. Other days, the younger girl, aged four, asks difficult questions like, \u201cWhen can you send the aeroplane to come and get us, Mummy?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Yvonne says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Yvonne is one of dozens of migrant women who have been refused permission for their children to join them in Britain. Despite current rules permitting healthcare workers to bring family members, single mothers, many of them recruited to work in the NHS and care sector, are routinely having their applications denied. The applications are being refused under a decades-old Home Office rule that a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living in the UK, unless the parent living here has sole responsibility. Many of the approximately 150 women who have come forward so far have supplied extensive evidence showing they are the children\u2019s primary caregivers. But the applications have still been refused. Yvonne says she moved to Britain to improve her family\u2019s future. \u201cWe\u2019re searching for greener pastures, to give our kids a better life,\u201d the 34-year-old says. Before departing, she says, her employer reassured her that it should be simple enough for her daughters to join her. So in March 2023 she left the girls in the temporary care of a nanny and boarded a flight. Two months later, after securing accommodation and starting her new job, she applied to the Home Office for the children\u2019s visas. Documents shared with the Observer show she explained that she had always cared for the girls, they had always lived with her, and supplied references from their schools, doctors and grandmother, along with consent letters from the other parent. The application was rejected on the grounds that the girls could live with other relatives, and that Yvonne had not provided \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for them to come. Ten months after she arrived, she is still battling the Home Office to reverse its decision. The girls are in the care of their grandparents, but Yvonne says this is not a long-term fix. \u201cMy parents are both in a bad position physically. They can\u2019t carry the burden of looking after a four-year-old,\u201d she says. \u201cI have looked after my children all their lives. And now to be told I don\u2019t have reason to live with them \u2026 that is the most painful thing.\u201d Another mother, Juliet Mupeni, said her 13-year-old son had been traumatised by the decision not to let him come. Mupeni, 37, a former university lecturer in cybersecurity, who moved from Zimbabwe in May to work as a live-in carer, supplied detailed evidence showing she is the boy\u2019s sole caregiver, including a letter from the Zimbabwean authorities stating she has, and always has had, sole parental responsibility. She also supplied letters from his school, doctor and church pastor, and a consent letter from the boy\u2019s father, who she says she separated from a decade ago. But the Home Office rejected the application, questioning why the boy, who is staying with a family friend, couldn\u2019t live with his dad. Mupeni submitted a fresh application with further proof, but this, too, was refused. In a cruel twist, the rejection letter said the fact the child had been without his mother since she moved to Britain was proof he did not need to come. \u201cMy son feels I have abandoned him. After the second refusal he was very very emotional. He was crying for several days,\u201d she says. \u201cI moved here specifically for his future. If I thought he couldn\u2019t join me I wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d In another case, a mother who was refused permission for her son to join her was told that as the boy\u2019s father had contact with the child \u201coccasionally and sporadically\u201d, this was proof he could stay with him. The Home Office also said a letter saying the child\u2019s grandmother had \u201cchronic conditions\u201d and could not care for the child long-term was not detailed enough, concluding there were no \u201ccompassionate and compelling circumstances\u201d to grant the visa. In other cases, women were asked to provide further evidence to support their applications so applied for court documents in their home countries. They had not needed them before as their separations or custody arrangements were informal. But the Home Office said that as the documents were dated recently, they had only been obtained for the purposes of securing a visa and refused the applications. Carol, 39, a care worker also from Zimbabwe, who has been denied a visa for her 17-year-old daughter, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know why they are doing this. It is like we are not human beings. It\u2019s like our families don\u2019t mean as much as the families we are coming to look after.\u201d Lawyers and charities are calling for the cases to be reviewed, and the Home Office approach to be modernised, so that caseworkers give more weight to what is in the children\u2019s best interests. Current Home Office guidance does allow for exceptions, telling caseworkers that even if the sole responsibility test is not met, they can still allow visas if there are compassionate grounds to do so. It explicitly says that a consent letter from the other parent would count in favour of their case. Yet many of the women providing such evidence are still having their children\u2019s visas declined. Applicants can apply for a review but these can be costly, take several months and look only at whether administrative errors were made. Sacha Wooldridge, head of immigration at law firm Birketts, said the sole responsibility test was intended to protect the other parent\u2019s rights, but that it did not recognise \u201ctoday\u2019s modern society\u201d and could be a \u201cvery blunt instrument\u201d. The Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association says the \u201csole responsibility\u201d test is \u201ccompletely out of step with current best practice\u201d. Last year, the cross-party peers on the House of Lords Justice and Home Affairs committee said the policy was tearing apart families and should be revised. Another mother, Amara, who moved from South Africa to Cheshire to work as a live-in carer, urged the Home Office to review the decisions and \u201cshow compassion\u201d. She has been fighting since July for her daughters, 12 and 14, to join her. \u201cWhen I heard about the UK needing healthcare workers I thought, \u2018OK, I would love to go and help out there.\u2019 But it feels like the UK doesn\u2019t care about us,\u201d she said. \u201cI would love the Home Office to be considerate and empathetic. I would ask them to put themselves in my shoes.\u201d",

        "body": "The idea of making proper friends with people you meet on holiday is so hilarious to British sensibilities that Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat turned it into a West End comedy. The Unfriend, starring Lee Mack and Sarah Alexander as a British couple who meet Elsa, an American woman travelling solo, is based on the premise that she takes their polite suggestion of a visit as a genuine invitation. The play may be funny, but it seems that increasing numbers of people are on Elsa\u2019s side. Solo travel is on the rise and the chance to make lifelong friendships is at the heart of it. The number of people going on holiday by themselves has risen from 6% in 2011 to 16% in 2023 according to the Association of British Travel Agents, which said people had a \u201cstrong appetite to go it alone\u201d. Some operators have seen big increases \u2013 solo bookings accounted for 46% of Tourhub\u2019s business last year. Solo doesn\u2019t always mean alone though. Lots of solo travellers join group tours, as Jen Burton did last year. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone at all and turned up at the airport completely terrified,\u201d said Burton, 40, who opened the Bea and Aud Lifestyle clothes shop in Buckingham last year. \u201cNow I\u2019ve made friends for life.\u201d She had recently split from her husband of 19 years, and had decided to join an Intrepid Travel trip to Jordan for 16 women organised by Claire and Laura Jopson, who run the travel blog Twin Perspectives. \u201cI walked up to some of the ladies in the check-in queue and straight away they kind of knew that I\u2019d been having a really tough time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe support you can get from a group of women you don\u2019t even know is phenomenal.\u201d Burton, who was the oldest, added: \u201c[I had] never laughed so hard in my whole life. But then in the next instance we\u2019d have these amazing feminist chats.\u201d Since the Jordan trip, many of the women have stayed in touch and last week Burton was hosting an Australian friend she met while travelling. Norway is next. \u201cThis time I\u2019ll share a room,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was slightly missing out in my own room.\u201d Companies such as Just You and Flash Pack cater specifically for solo travellers, while others, including Newmarket Holidays, Riviera Travel and Jules Verne, offer solo-only or solo-friendly trips. \u201cSixty per cent of our travellers are solo,\u201d said Yves Marceau, vice president for products at G Adventures. He said the company went to great efforts to design tours that fostered friendships, making sure there was enough time for people to meet each other and mingle. Tour guides were trained to create a sense of camaraderie and to spot when people might not be getting on. \u201cA young man in his early 20s wrote to us about his trip,\u201d Marceau said. \u201cHe was sharing a room with a guy who was 75. He said \u2018my initial reaction was, Oh, my God, this is going to be a dreadful experience. But over the course of the first few days, I became so connected with this gentleman that we are still friends.\u2019 Those [stories] are the reason we do this.\u201d G Adventures and some other firms, such as Hostelworld, have created their own apps with social elements, but smaller companies use other social media. Chris Bone, the founder of Adventure Solos, invites every tour member to a WhatsApp group when they book. \u201cIt really breaks the ice,\u201d Bone said. He runs adventure weekends and week-long expeditions around the UK, with activities including hiking, canoeing and climbing. \u201cOften people might be travelling a long way, and they\u2019ll car share or get the same train. And often people have been to events before.\u201d It means that an hour into a hike, Bone\u2019s guests are very relaxed. \u201cWhat\u2019s really nice is that all this stuff comes flooding out. People have often been through a recent life change. But no one knows anyone else and [there are] no preconceived ideas.\u201d Not that every group creates friendships. \u201cThere were a couple of guys who were persistently late every day,\u201d said Carole Railton, a body language expert and author, of a trip to Morocco. \u201cWe had buses picking us up or trains to catch, and they would amble down. People were grumpy because they were taking time out of everyone\u2019s holiday.\u201d Joyce Connor, a makeup artist, was one of only two solo travellers on a trip to Vietnam, and the other woman was much older. \u201cI\u2019m 60,\u201d she said. \u201cI basically ended up being her carer for two weeks. It wasn\u2019t fun. She didn\u2019t know how to use her phone or check in for her flight. And she didn\u2019t want to eat alone, but she only wanted to go to places that had English food. In Vietnam. \u201cBut on another trip I met a woman on day two and it turned out we have a mutual friend. Now the three of us go out together.\u201d There are still plenty of solo travellers who avoid groups, and life has become easier for them. People used to look down on solo travellers, according to Georgie Darling, a freelance travel writer. \u201cIt was something people thought you did out of desperation. Now it\u2019s become more of a \u2018cool concept\u2019.\u201d Travel influencers on TikTok and Instagram, such as Janet Newenham, have shown that solo travel can be admirable, Darling said. She stays in co-living spaces \u2013 hostels with private rooms and workplaces. \u201cI look for expat groups in the city or town I\u2019m at. So I\u2019m in Mexico now, and this morning I\u2019m going to a brunch for female entrepreneurs. Everyone is here with the intention of meeting new people \u2013 last night there was a taco bar crawl. \u201cI\u2019ve just joined a WhatsApp group for women in London who are solo travelling. And already there\u2019s been about 15 different trips arranged, with people saying \u2018I\u2019m going to be in Copenhagen this weekend\u2019. These things are easy to find now.\u201d",

        "body": "Piero Busso Langhe Nebbiolo, Piemonte, Italy 2017 (\u00a323.21, justerinis.com) Like many \u2013 most \u2013 people, I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m at my best in January. But I have at least come to a kind of accommodation with this long, dark month, a grudging respect for its uncompromising January-ness, which, looked at in the right way, can be seen as a kind of tonic or antidote to the glittery, sugary, fatty excesses of December. Certainly, in the kitchen so far this year, I\u2019ve come to appreciate the unfussy, almost austere charms of this season\u2019s vegetables cooked simply: the sweetly earthy bass tones of root vegetables and the trilling variations on a theme of bittersweet of cabbages, kale and sprouts. As for wine, I reckon the ideal style for this sort of food and mood, and weather, are reds that are filled with flavour, depth and texture, but don\u2019t feel fat or sweet or overly rich and syrupy, and which invigorate with acidity like a shaft of piercing wintry light: over to you Piero Busso. Tesco Finest Ribera del Duero, Spain 2021 (\u00a312, Tesco) Italy is a fertile source of wines that have the balance of depth and brightness I\u2019m looking for in January. The nebbiolo grape used to produce the delightfully pristine, fragrant red fruit in Piero Busso Langhe Nebbiolo, for example, is also used to make Barolo and Barbaresco, two great Piemontese wines which, with their trademark mix of satisfyingly sandpapery tannins and ethereal fragrance would be on my table every night in winter were I a considerably wealthier man. (If you do have circa \u00a350 to \u00a360 to spare, you could do worse than spend it on one of Piero Busso\u2019s Barberesco wines from justerinis.com and others). More affordably, from Piedmont, Morrisons The Best Barbera d\u2019Asti 2020 (\u00a37) offers a robust, high-acid hit of intense dark plum and cherry, while Tesco can offer a wintry alternative from the high-altitude Spanish region of Ribera del Duero, where the ample inky mulberry fruit is offset by a dusting of spice and a shaft of cool-night freshness. Teliani Valley Winery 97 Saperavi, Kakheti, Georgia 2021 (from \u00a311.69, premiercrufinewine.co.uk; nywines.co.uk; ndjohn.co.uk) Other red wines that seem to fit this moment can be found farther east from two ancient wine cultures that have been enjoying a renaissance in recent years: Georgia and Greece. In Georgia, it\u2019s the saperavi grape variety that offers the collection of qualities that I seem to crave: it makes dark, inky, almost opaque red wines that at their best are fit to burst with blackberry juiciness and peppery and dark chocolatey flavour, but which, as is the case of the wines of Teliani, are succulent, bright and invigoratingly sappy, grippy and savoury. In Greece, meanwhile, I love the red-plum skin tang and cherry-ish acidity that enlivens Semeli Feast Red, Nemea 2022 (from \u00a39.95, thewinesociety.com; henningswine.co.uk; novelwine.co.uk), while the xinomavro grape variety, as used in star winemaker Apostolos Thymiopoulos\u2019 Earth &amp; Sky 2021 (from \u00a326, thewinesociety.com; vincognito.co.uk) has notes of juniper, pomegranate and red cherry in a perfume-and-power combination that makes it the Macedonian answer to Barolo.

        "body": "I am suffering serious plot envy. The cause: a five-acre organic garden in southern Kerala. Close by the ocean. The soil is rich and red, with a crumb like cake. Everywhere, an abundant variety of fruit and vegetables. Snake gourds, aubergine, turmeric, ginger, species of extravagant beans. There are multiple varieties of chilli. Plus, tomatoes and peppers, many trays of coriander. Coconut is abundant: crazily tall skinny trees, alarmingly cropped by men free-climbing on spiked metal shoes. Fruit is hacked off with machetes, branches crashing down. I take to wandering around most mornings. Often in envy, more often in near-open-mouthed admiration. I am joined by shrieking peacocks, a pair of playful mongooses. Paths are lined with clover. Also marigolds grown for companion planting and puja. At the bottom of the site is a huge, ancient water tank. Just beyond it, a rich neighbour\u2019s incongruous helipad. There are many beds of yams and red amaranth. Grown from single seedlings immaculately spaced for optimum growth. I feel I am being gently schooled. Banana plants are dotted through the site. Their fruit no larger than fat fingers. Papaya cascades in extravagant bunches. I am inspired by a recycling innovation. Decapitated 5-litre plastic water bottles used as plant pots. The tops put out as mini greenhouses covering germinating seed. Another revelation is bhindi: lady fingers. I only today discovered it is a Hibiscus esculentus. Beautiful tall, single-flowered mallow plants spiked with cornered fruit. A gardener breaks one off for us to eat raw. It\u2019s crisp, delicate, delicious. Later, we enjoy them in vegetable thoran. In a sambar with idli for breakfast. Both are simple perfection: inspirational plot to plate. But now please tell us: what gardening or gardeners inspire you?

        "body": "What exactly are night creams? Cynics might say they were any cream you slap on at bedtime. They\u2019re just thicker moisturisers, right? To be clear: they are not, or at least they shouldn\u2019t be. During the day your skin works overtime to protect itself from environmental aggressors. At night it goes into repair mode, which means it needs products to work accordingly. While you sleep, the skin loses a higher rate of moisture than it does during the day \u2013 it\u2019s known as transepidermal water loss \u2013 so a day cream won\u2019t touch the sides. Meaning you need great night-time formulas with powerful ingredients. Many of these increase your skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun, but they are perfect to use while you sleep. So with the plethora of night creams on the market, how does one choose? Well think about what issue you want to tackle and be led by the ingredients that help with that: retinols and glycolic acids help to refine, resurface and smooth skin texture; vitamin C and other acids (malic and lactic, for instance) will help brighten skin; ceramide-rich night products are great for firming, plumping and boosting the skin\u2019s barrier, etc. The tried and tested is also not a bad place to start: Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Advanced Night Repair is an excellent beauty editor stalwart that addresses everything from hydration to radiance. Oh, and another thing to note: night creams can be serums or even masks. They don\u2019t have to be creams. 1. Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair \u00a365, esteelauder.co.uk 2.

        "body": "Time blunts the radical. Yet when Stravinsky\u2019s Les Noces sounds across the elegantly transfigured spaces of a former fireworks factory in Woolwich, it rings as shockingly original as it did on its premiere in 1923. Giselle, with Adolphe Adam\u2019s tinkling score wafting across the London Coliseum\u2019s gilded auditorium, not so much. Mary Skeaping\u2019s 1971 production of this great Romantic ballet for English National Ballet, however, has the merit of reminding us just why, in 1841, it too was full of the shock of the new. A story about the exploitation of the lower classes; an eerie supernatural second act; a heroine dancing on pointe shoes, light as a feather, seeming to materialise out of the air; a ballerina taking centre stage for the first time. It remains a glorious sight, and ENB dance it with loving care. The second act is a wonder of chiaroscuro, shafts of light (courtesy of David Mohr\u2019s lighting design) dappling the skirts of the ghostly Wilis as they pursue hapless men to their deaths; the corps de ballet bring both menace and a graceful uniformity to the scene. As Giselle, Ukrainian first soloist Katja Khaniukova performs with striking truthfulness. There\u2019s a clip of her on YouTube being coached by Alessandra Ferri, one of the great Giselles, and that learning is reflected in the clarity and directness of the first act, when this girl who lives to dance heartbreakingly dies of a broken heart. In the second, when she returns as a ghost, it\u2019s her honesty that carries her through; you believe this is a woman who would want to save Aitor Arrieta\u2019s remorseful, noble Albrecht. Fabian Reimair makes a notably tortured Hilarion, Albrecht\u2019s rival, whose jealousy precipitates the tragedy; it\u2019s nice to see him played as a disappointed man in love rather than a meddling baddie. Alison McWhinney is a chilly Myrtha, imperious queen of the Wilis. Woolwich Works is a happening artistic development in a changing part of London, home to Carlos Acosta\u2019s Dance Centre and Punchdrunk theatre\u2019s base. At the Fireworks Factory, the New Movement Collective, a group of enterprising contemporary dancers, many of whom have worked with Rambert, presented an ambitious hour-long bill built around Stravinsky\u2019s Les Noces (originally choreographed by Nijinska). It\u2019s extraordinary how this 100-year old piece still sounds more revolutionary than the new music with which it\u2019s surrounded here. Les Noces: The Departure is jointly choreographed by its performers and features new compositions from Andrea Balency-B\u00e9arn and Yshani Perinpanayagam. The first contains resounding bells and fiercely plucked piano strings; the second is a setting of John Cage\u2019s love letters to Merce Cunningham, communicatively sung by baritone Ross Ramgobin, accompanied on piano by Perinpanayagam, who is also music director and conductor for the night. The main event, in Stravinsky\u2019s original version for four pianos, percussion, a choir and four soloists, is compellingly played by musicians from the Royal College of Music, with the chorus of Opera Holland Park. When soprano April Koyejo-Audiger sings the opening bars \u2013 \u201cListen\u201d \u2013 from the midst of the gathered dancers at the centre of a long catwalk of a stage, there\u2019s a thrilling sense of anticipation. If the new choreography never quite matches the challenge of the music, it\u2019s attractive enough, unfolding through groupings of sharply angled arms and curved backs; the dancers alternately supporting one another and breaking away, suggesting a community at one and at war. Clothes are knotted together to hold an individual aloft or to suggest a bridal veil. It\u2019s interesting but not quite dynamic enough, a thought rather than a propulsion. The evening, gently braided together like the bride\u2019s plait, ends with Chameleon Youth from Manchester moving to MC Zani\u2019s Rhythmic Resurgence, a response to Stravinsky\u2019s rhythm through the mouth of beatboxer Jack Hobbs. The whole thing makes for an adventurous entertainment.

        "body": "Jonny Lee Miller is a 51-year-old British actor who has played Sick Boy in Trainspotting, Sherlock Holmes in Elementary and John Major in The Crown. In 2012 he won a joint Olivier award with Benedict Cumberbatch for Frankenstein on stage, and this month stars in the West End transfer of Sam Holcroft\u2019s play A Mirror, which was a sell-out hit at the Almeida last summer. Miller lives mainly in New York, where he is a volunteer firefighter, and has a 15-year-old son. How does it feel to go on stage every night? Are there nerves? Terror? Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t call it terror. It\u2019s frightening, for sure, but that\u2019s what makes it so much fun. It\u2019s really the most fun you\u2019re going to have acting. Because it\u2019s live and people demonstrate their enjoyment of it. You don\u2019t get that electric experience from even some of the most intense things doing film and television. A Mirror starts out as a wedding at which the audience are guests. But it soon becomes clear that it\u2019s actually an underground dramatic performance set in an unspecified totalitarian society. What appealed to you about the play? Honestly, all the characters have a journey. I know that sounds cliched, but they\u2019re all not what they seem. And there are many layers. So we have a play within a play within a play at some point. My character is the minister of culture, who thinks he\u2019s a good guy, but is he? So the play explores artistic expression, truth, fiction and censorship. Which makes it sound quite heavy, but it\u2019s actually very funny. What\u2019s the best and worst thing about being back in the UK? Well, I get to see people I haven\u2019t seen, which is a gift. But at the same time you can\u2019t watch football on television on a Saturday, when they play the games, which is just a constant source of bemusement and makes me furious. So that\u2019s a problem. You qualified last year as a volunteer firefighter in Long Island, New York. Have you seen any action yet? Yeah, just when I was leaving last summer to come to the Almeida, I did get to go on my first fire. The siren goes off, our pagers go off, and I ran out of my house, and I could smell the smoke in the air, so it was very close. And the pager tells us that we have a residential structure fire, which is serious. So it was nerve-racking and you just don\u2019t want to make a mistake. But we actually managed to get this fire put out before it took two houses, and nobody got hurt. So it was the perfect call-out really. It\u2019s probably a trite comparison, but how does the buzz compare to, say, getting the very good reviews for A Mirror? Acting, we tell stories, and that serves a function and it\u2019s important. But to respond to a medical emergency or just to be able to actually have an impact like that on somebody else\u2019s life, it doesn\u2019t really compare. Honestly, if I could make a living doing it, I may well just do that. Does Trainspotting remain as treasured for you as it does for many of us? Of course. I owe so much to that experience. Especially the older you get, the more you look back and think: \u201cWow, how lucky to have been involved in something like that.\u201d Whatever else happens, you can always be proud of that. You\u2019ve suggested before that you didn\u2019t fully capitalise on the success of the film. Do you still feel that? Yeah, but it\u2019s not something that bothers me. It\u2019s just life. Everything worked out great, really. I was secretly ambitious, but I didn\u2019t really know how to execute that or take advantage of certain opportunities. But it\u2019s all good, because I\u2019m here in a freezing-cold church rehearsing a play! There\u2019s been a 90s revival trend the past few years. When you think of your own personal experience of the decade, what pops into your head? I can\u2019t remember! Look, just absolute joy is what pops into my head. You\u2019re in a successful movie, so you get to hang out with Oasis and stuff like that, and I just loved all that shit. We were young and having fun, so no harm done really. It\u2019s the time when you\u2019ve just left home and you\u2019re figuring out how to negotiate your career path, people and relationships. But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s all over though! You had some high-profile relationships, including being married to Angelina Jolie. Are you relieved social media wasn\u2019t around back then? Yep. I can\u2019t really imagine\u2026 And I don\u2019t know how people navigate that when they\u2019re doing the kind of shit I was doing. You were cast, somewhat against type, as John Major in The Crown. Did you change your perspective on him? One hundred per cent changed my perspective. I was raised in a very, very socialist household, but the more I read about Sir John, the more I liked him. He\u2019s one of the most misunderstood politicians ever: he was very magnetic and had a great sense of humour. That\u2019s actually how Peter Morgan [the creator of The Crown] described him to me. He said: \u201cHe\u2019s George fucking Clooney!\u201d Oh right, what am I doing here then? What would you predict and hope for yourself for the next few years? Oh, Jesus! I don\u2019t live extravagantly and I\u2019d like to be able to make enough money acting so that I can be a firefighter and a parent as much as possible. My child is everything to me. And I don\u2019t need to work for the sake of it, so the less work I do, the more I can put into it. My dream is to not be on everyone\u2019s screens too much, but to make it good when I am. It sounds like you\u2019re in a good place\u2026 Thanks, man, it\u2019s only taken me 50 years. A Mirror is at the Trafalgar theatre, London, 22 January-20 April",

        "body": "Thomas von Steinaecker\u2019s documentary portrait of Werner Herzog, the singular German film-making talent who gave us pictures such as Aguirre, Wrath of God, Fitzcarraldo and the documentary Grizzly Man, is every bit as fascinating as you would hope. A director who is not just open to the chaos on the fringes of civilisation, but who voluntarily invites it into his life (in the form of the actor and world-class pain in the ass Klaus Kinski), Herzog has a wealth of meaty anecdotes. Radical Dreamer is less successful in its attempt to bring in other voices to appraise his legacy: interviewees tie themselves in knots of gushing superlatives, but the real insights come from the man himself.",

        "body": "Every day I rise early, like a stock trader, to start the daily business of sending and receiving adorable videos. Pigs wearing pig costumes, alien creatures spanking each other\u2019s botties, relationship dynamics explored via gibberish, talking cats and noodly cartoons. My friends and I are in deep, but how did this happen? \u201cCuteness has been slowly taking over our world,\u201d says Claire Catterall, curator of the Cute exhibition at London\u2019s Somerset House. \u201cIt\u2019s now accepted as one of our languages.\u201d It\u2019s a language that wouldn\u2019t exist without the internet. Even in 2014, Tim Berners-Lee expressed surprise at how his invention was being used. \u201cI\u2019m amazed to see the many great things it\u2019s achieved.\u201d Another thing that surprised him? \u201cKittens,\u201d he told Reddit readers. You could see the origins of cute, its Rosetta Stone, perhaps, in one memorable cat meme from 2007, \u201cI can haz cheezburger?\u201d which gave rise to lolspeak, still influencing the way we talk online. Words like zoomies, gorlies and besties are still riding high. Clearly, something in this squishy way of talking captivates us, even shapes our identity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where cuteness will go or how it will be used, but we do know it\u2019s powerful,\u201d says Catterall. (Of course she has the word \u201ccat\u201d in her name.) So why is cuteness everywhere and what does it mean for us? To answer, we must consider a more basic question, that turns out to be surprisingly slippery. What is cuteness? At the basic level, it\u2019s an evolutionary adaptation, developed by babies so we don\u2019t abandon them for being useless. Yet it\u2019s also cultural. Most of our sparkly, rainbow vocabulary of cuteness comes from kawaii, an aesthetic that developed in Japanese girls\u2019 schools around 1900. It influenced manga and anime, before being commercialised by brands. Particularly one. In the 1990s, every girl I knew \u2013 all five of them \u2013 was obsessed with Hello Kitty. They stuck her on their books, bags and hearts. Author Christine Yano has coined the term \u201cpink globalisation\u201d to describe the domination of the demure, cat-like figure created by entertainment company Sanrio to rival Mickey Mouse. In her wake came San-X bears, Tamagotchi, Pok\u00e9mon and Pusheen in the US. Hello Kitty mewed so that they could\u2026 make whatever noises they make. Actually, I don\u2019t know if she mewed. She has no mouth. Kawaii evolved, influencing Korean culture, its current torchbearer. We can detect it in playful, street-style subcultures, including Decora, which focuses on charms, hairbows and other accessories. If young people are wearing something you don\u2019t understand \u2013 well, now you do. This is where things get weird. Cuteness is a manipulation, designed to trigger our protective instinct, but it isn\u2019t just triggered by human offspring. In 1943, animal behaviourist Konrad Lorenz described the \u201cchild scheme\u201d: a set of physical features that make certain creatures adorable to us. It includes big heads and large eyes, short, thick extremities and round bodies. He\u2019s talking about chonky bois. Studies have proved we actually find puppies cuter than babies. This makes sense of the hapless, round, bumbling anthropomorphic figures that deluge social media. They, too, in a sense, have been selectively bred. In an attention economy, cuteness hacks our brains, emotionally attaching us to almost anything. How is it advantageous that if someone sticks eyes on a watermelon, we\u2019d take a bullet for it? Things get more nuts when you consider the odd range of stuff we find cute. Kittens and bunnies, but also hairless cats and killer dolls. In his book The Power of Cute, philosopher Simon May proposes that cuteness exists on a spectrum. At one pole, childlike objects that arouse our protective instincts; towards the uncanny end, \u201csweet qualities get distorted into something darker, more indeterminate and more wounded\u201d. This \u201cunpindownability\u201d explains how cute objects can be simultaneously ugly and appealing, young and old, monstrous and sweet. Catterall points to ET and Yoda, but I\u2019m immediately reminded of Gus, the three-legged, one-eyed Chinese crested dog voted \u201cugliest dog in the world\u201d eight times, before dying of cancer. I have a picture of Gus on my wall, liver spotted and tongue-lolling, hideous really, but he makes my heart burst with love. The most disturbing aspect of cuteness, though, is its amorality. I\u2019m addicted to the Instagram account @sylvaniandrama, which enacts tales of prison breaks, casual drugs and slatternly behaviour with family dolls. In an essay for the Cute exhibition, Isabel Galleymore describes how wholesome imagery can equally lend its affective power to extremists. She gives the example of Moominvalley, which has been appropriated by eco-fascists, who are both white supremacists and environmentalists. In one meme, \u201cSnufkin, a deep thinker who enjoys fishing and playing his harmonica, bears a swastika on his green felt hat.\u201d Cuteness is deeply subversive, according to Cute Studies scholars (bet they have amazing stationery). Why is it everywhere now? The answer is in our cultural moment. We\u2019re drawn to na\u00efve things as a form of magical thinking \u2013 a desire to live in a cruelty-free world, where everything is safe. We use \u201cadulting\u201d as a verb now, as if there were another option. Glittery unicorns are one way off this collapsing planet, with its daily horrors. But you know how anxiety works. It gets through. That\u2019s why the other side speaks to us, too. Figures like Gloomy Bear, a pink ursine with blood perpetually dripping from his paws. While writing this, a friend on holiday in Thailand sent me a picture of a T-shirt emblazoned with a cartoon sun, dolphins with dog faces, and the words \u201cI\u2019m dead inside!\u201d I asked her to get me two. As Simon May tells me over email, dark cuteness \u201cboth comforts us in a world of unnerving uncertainty \u2013 and gives voice to that same world, but crucially in a lighthearted register\u201d. Look at Gudetama, a more recent Sanrio figure, described as \u201cHello Kitty for millennials\u201d. An egg yolk with a butt, but no neck, the blobby, genderless figure is notable for its low-octane personality. It mostly lies in its albumen, feeling lazy and defeated. It is vulnerable, but more than that, it\u2019s tired, boss. Gudetama is all of us. We don\u2019t take cute things seriously, but we do listen, says Catterall. They \u201callow difficult things to be said openly. It\u2019s a safe space.\u201d The Somerset House exhibition shows how artists like Rachel Maclean are drawn to the boundary-less, fluid nature of cute, the way it undermines rigid categories and provides space for otherness. The language of cuteness is getting more sophisticated. But most of us are not artists and not sophisticated. I worry that I\u2019m slowly boiling myself into idiocy. I overuse exclamation marks and kisses, whether I\u2019m replying to a plumber\u2019s quote or the prime minister\u2019s press secretary. The childish excitability is another way I have grown cute. I routinely have to do a \u201cderangement proofread\u201d of work emails, removing 60% of the punctuation, before signing off, \u201cNo worries!\u201d In real life, I\u2019m very worries. I think this is why many of us scrape and cringe our way through written exchanges. We\u2019re aware how easily tone can be missed \u2013 what if we\u2019re offending someone, without realising? In this paranoid atmosphere, a short sentence looks dismissive. A full stop, downright rude. \u201cOK\u201d, once an unremarkable response, now feels like slamming dog-mess through a letterbox. Online communication seems to boil down to a simple choice: charge into a possible war every day, guns out, or else recuse ourselves on the grounds that we are just a silly lil\u2019 floofer. Cuteness has a solution \u2013 enter our friend, the emoji. The colourful, non-aggressive stickers have transformed messaging. I use them in every message, every reaction. But to what end? Over Zoom, I consult Jo Nicholl, a relationship therapist and podcast host who has lived in Asia. Before I ask a question, Nicholl demonstrates the new cute craze from Vietnam that her son has taught her. It\u2019s similar to the photo trend of joining one\u2019s hands together, shaping a heart in negative space. Instead, Nicholl crosses the tops of her thumb and first fingers \u2013 think a pinch of salt, but slightly wider. \u201cIt\u2019s like a heart emoji, but it\u2019s two little baby hearts!\u201d she squeals, before dropping her voice ominously. \u201cFuck off already. I\u2019m over it.\u201d What\u2019s wrong with using emoji? \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional bypass,\u201d she explains. We rely on them to represent how we feel, the problem being that \u201cthey\u2019re an expanded range of Mister Men cartoons.\u201d How many times a day do we send the heart emoji? Does it mean the same thing every time? Unlikely. Emoji homogenise feelings and shortcut personal expressions, says Nicholl, whose work involves teaching people to have adult conversations and better understand themselves. We hide in cuteness, she says. Our true feelings are usually ambivalent and complicated. Her concerns extend beyond the personal. \u201cWe are being trained to look at objects of limited emotional width and say, \u2018This is my feeling\u2019,\u201d Nicholl explains. The problem is, identification cuts two ways. \u201cWe are being led into a world in which we get used to looking at non-human, AI faces and think we know what they\u2019re feeling. A world in which AI tells us how we feel.\u201d This will probably be how we diagnose emotional distress in future, she predicts. \u201cWe won\u2019t sit with a therapist, we\u2019ll be with an AI.\u201d Who loves cute things most? Advertising executives! There\u2019s a reason meerkats peddle boring, insurance-based price-comparison websites. Rebecca Hughes, a brand strategist, cites the example of Guide Dogs for the blind. For \u201ca charity that provides much needed support for blind people, their early ads didn\u2019t feature blind people very much,\u201d she notes. Bouncy labrador puppies were simply the more effective sell. Advertising is an industry that grasps the dark power of an amoral appeal to feelings. Cuteness reduces price sensitivity, which makes us happier to hand over money. Research also suggests that when companies transgress, having a cute mascot makes consumers want to protect them. The brands themselves are seen as \u201cmalleable\u201d, or in the process of growing and learning. Here is a sleeping giant, overlooked for being feminine and trivial. Don\u2019t doubt that this is a force shaping us. As the web evolves and self-presentation becomes ever more important, cuteness offers us a way to hide and expose, be perfect and vulnerable, irresistible yet anarchic. Cuteness may be everywhere, but it\u2019s far from clear it has our best interests at heart. The horizon is pink, but hazy. It strikes me there\u2019s a comparison with humour. Both feel good, while undermining fixed categories \u2013 that\u2019s how punchlines work. Comedy was considered low art before it came to dominate the mainstream. It has since become a cultural battleground. Something as affable as being funny can undermine democracies, its rock stars carrying the darkness of their work into life. Am I saying we should cancel kittens? Don\u2019t get cute. We should perhaps try to interrupt its manipulations, though. Hack the hack, as it were. Working on the exhibition has changed Catterall. She\u2019s no longer affected the way she once was by images of \u201canything maimed, hurt or pathetic, tugging at the heart strings\u201d. She finds the knowledge of what they\u2019re trying to do strangely repulsive. \u201cAt the same time, give me a puppy and I\u2019m a puddle.\u201d Cute is at Somerset House, London WC2, from 25 January to 14 April.

        "body": "This immensely likable debut novel from Irish writer Ferdia Lennon opens in Syracuse, south-east Sicily, in 412BC. The city has lately defeated a military expedition from Athens and thousands of surviving invaders have been thrown into nearby quarries to rot. No Syracusans lament their fate until two locals visit one day with an idea to cast the prisoners in a play by Euripides. The two men are Gelon, a melancholy theatre obsessive, and his wisecracking friend Lampo, who narrates the novel in a distinctly un-Sicilian voice. \u201cWould you be knowing any passages?\u201d he demands of a near-dead Athenian, seeking an actor to play Jason in Medea. Soon the pair are sneaking down daily to rehearse their ragtag troupe for a double bill to which the whole town is invited. It\u2019s an uproarious premise, but Irish accents aside, the scenario isn\u2019t quite as far-fetched as it might appear. There are accounts in Plutarch of Athenian prisoners in Sicily trading lines of Euripides in return for food and drink or even freedom. The novel is raucously funny \u2013 Lampo is a brilliant comic creation \u2013 but Lennon, a classics graduate, blends the laughs with tragedy of the blackest pitch. The writing is beautifully controlled. The eyes of a vengeful Syracusan, hollowed out by grief, become \u201ca black sea under an eclipse\u201d. Gelon\u2019s breath, in one dismal scene, \u201cmakes weird shapes in the air like grey flowers are bursting from his lips and wilting on the wind\u201d. Lampo does atrocious things in a bid to be helpful. Scrabbling for money to buy costumes, he proposes robbing an old man with no legs. Later, marvelling that strangers gave up their lives to save his, he wonders if he\u2019d have done the same. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he decides. But his experience in the quarries, collaborating with enemies to shed light on human suffering through theatre, does unlock selfless impulses he never knew he had. Lennon stops well short of suggesting that stories have the power to heal the world, but \u2013 just sometimes \u2013 they can make a difference to individual lives. As Lampo puts it in a moment of fleeting optimism: \u201cI\u2019m pouring water in the desert, hoping flowers grow.\u201d Glorious Exploits by Ferdia Lennon is published by Fig Tree (\u00a316.99).

        "body": "Daniel Kaluuya, Kane \u201cKano\u201d Robinson and I are in a frou-frou hotel in London, all flowery cushions and curly mirrors, discussing differences. Differences between what home means when you\u2019re young and when you\u2019re older, differences between being good at something and being passionate about it, and the difference between a movie and a film. A movie, according to them, is big: ambitious, widescreen, built for success. A film is smaller: personal, niche, hopeful of attention. The Kitchen is a new Netflix drama that Kaluuya wrote, produced and co-directed with Kibwe Tavares, and in which Robinson (Kano for his music) stars. The Kitchen is definitely, they say, a movie. \u201cWe\u2019re making a MOVIE!\u201d\u201d says Robinson to Kaluuya. \u201cI remember early days, when you were talking about The Kitchen, that\u2019s what you kept saying. It was distinctly a movie versus a film. Like the anti-kitchen sink.\u201d Kaluuya laughs. \u201cWe\u2019re not kitchen sink, we\u2019re the whole kitchen. The whole fucking room.\u201d Kaluuya, 34, has a big, infectious laugh, and I\u2019m happy to hear it. We\u2019re about 15 minutes into the interview, and at the start, he wasn\u2019t laughing at all. Everything had been a bit rushed. They were both late for the photos, because of grooming and styling, and though the photographer worked amazingly quickly, they still have to leave at a non-negotiable time, because Kaluuya is acting in another film, and he\u2019s due on set. So there was a slight air of tension during pictures (the room was packed with stylists and PRs), and for the first 10 minutes of our interview, Kaluuya hardly speaks. He doesn\u2019t seem grumpy, just unforthcoming, his big eyes assessing. But then he suddenly perks up (he likes my big notebook, he tells me, it reminds him of his school books) and the atmosphere changes, snap! Like the sun coming out. That\u2019s how charismatic Kaluuya is. When he shines, you see not only the dazzling Oscar-winning acting hero, but the director who can motivate and encourage, get everyone grinning and working together. When he\u2019s in, he\u2019s all in. Robinson, 38, also charming, is more even, less front foot. Fans of his music know his dynamics \u2013 he can move from introspection to cold anger to up-in-your-face energy \u2013 and he can be rigorous, as well as raucous. But when he, too, breaks into guffaws, it\u2019s like the hotel room is a balloon. Up we go! Both are hugely popular and respected. Kaluuya has given brilliant performances in films as wildly different as Get Out, Queen &amp; Slim, Black Panther and Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse and won an Oscar in 2021 for his portrayal of Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. Robinson, whose last two albums, 2016\u2019s Made in the Manor and 2019\u2019s Mercury-nominated Hoodies All Summer, received extensive critical acclaim, spent 2018 to 2023 playing main man Sully in possibly the most influential UK TV series of recent years, Top Boy. They are big stars, and to get the two of them in the same room is a coup. When I tell people I\u2019m interviewing Robinson and Kaluuya, together, they practically faint. They\u2019ve been friends for ages, but neither can recall how or where they met. When I ask, they look at each other, puzzled. \u201cFrom about, just London\u201d is the conclusion. So who stays at parties the longest? They both burst out laughing. \u201cHe stays the longest,\u201d says Kaluuya, \u201cbut while I\u2019m there!\u201d Robinson: \u201cTwo hours turns into 10\u2026\u201d Kaluuya: \u201cI like to stay! I love music, I love music.\u201d Robinson: \u201cHe\u2019s the party starter!\u201d They are full of mischief. A few weeks after our interview, they both travel to the US to promote The Kitchen, and, on Instagram, you can see their \u201cout out\u201d vibe: messing around at basketball games, playing for the camera. These boys work and then, they play. That serious but fun mood is woven through The Kitchen, which is set on a dilapidated council estate called the Kitchen in a dystopian, near-future London. Authoritarian outside forces attack the estate, but among the residents, there\u2019s solidarity and joy. A sequence in a roller disco, where everyone joins in the Candy dance, is about as upbeat a nightclub scene as I\u2019ve ever seen on film. \u201cYeah,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cWhen that scene wrapped, we were meant to leave, but you [Kaluuya] were like, Noooo!\u201d \u201cI was with the DJ going, \u2018Drop another one, drop another one,\u201d\u2019\u2019 says Kaluuya. \u201cAnd she played Pop Smoke and it went off! And then I was like, \u2018Play Kano\u2026!\u2019 That scene is real because it was real. You can feel it.\u201d The Kitchen took a long time to come to screen \u2013 Kaluuya started writing it as far back as 2012 \u2013 but he and co-director Tavares always had Robinson in mind for the main part, and involved him throughout, exchanging ideas on voice notes and WhatsApps. Originally, Kaluuya\u2019s film concept was inspired by the moped gangs that rob places such as the Westfield shopping centre, a sort of Robin Hood tale, but gradually that aspect moved into the background. Instead, he focused on the story of Izi, a loner and long-term Kitchen resident, played by Robinson. As Izi, Robinson conveys a lot with just a facial flicker \u2013 his eyes are especially expressive \u2013 and Kaluuya says, as a director, he really \u201cleaned in\u201d to this subtle performance, \u201ca blink, or a look, those nuances, those details, we took the tone from that\u201d. Such fine-drawn character acting is what Kaluuya loves about British cinema, and he wanted that in The Kitchen, but married to the scale and ambition of a US movie. \u201cI love British film, yes, but we can still be big. My point is: we [can] do what we want. It\u2019s just a story. Everything\u2019s made up. So make it epic, man. Why not?\u201d The epicness in The Kitchen comes especially from the fantastic visuals. The estate itself is like a concrete Brazilian favela: sprawling, rickety, labyrinthine, patched up, with familiar London landmarks such as the Eye seen in the near distance. On the ground, in the Kitchen market, all is neon-lit and buzzing with life. But the flats and upper walkways are wrecked, barricaded, barely functional. And every so often, the estate comes under attack, from an anonymous, shield- and baton-wielding riot police-cum-army. The residents bang pan lids when the attackers arrive, like Belfast wives during the Troubles. Despite such international references, and its heightened, offbeat weirdness, The Kitchen is recognisably set in London. \u201cYeah, it feels like London,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cThe London I grew up in, the confidence and bravado and community and connection between the people\u2026 Usually, when you make a film about an attack, it becomes a film about the attacker, as opposed to the people under attack. What we wanted to explore was those people\u2019s identity and [sense of] community in spite of the attacks.\u201d We see flats on another estate, too: new-built, expensive, sterile. This is the Buena Vida apartment complex. The concierge is a computer. There\u2019s not much of a community. It\u2019s here that Izi aspires to buy, the wipe-clean atmosphere offering a new start. He doesn\u2019t like the Kitchen. He calls it a \u201cshithole\u201d. Actually, Robinson, who thinks hard about the authenticity of his acting, says he struggled a bit with Izi\u2019s attitude. Izi deliberately isolates himself from the community, because he knows he wants to leave. We first see him hogging the only functioning shower, a queue of other residents waiting. \u201cIt was hard to get my head around the way Izi is,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause, in that same scenario, I don\u2019t see myself being the character who would just want to get out, to leave everyone he\u2019s grown up around, who are really fighting for each other, caring for each other. But Izi sees it a completely different way, like: \u2018We\u2019re going to lose. This is my solo mission. I want out.\u2019\u201d The central relationship of the film is between Izi and Benji, played beautifully by newcomer Jedaiah Bannerman, with a young teenager\u2019s heartbreaking mix of defiance and vulnerability. Benji tries to crack Izi\u2019s solo approach and become close to him. A father-son dynamic develops between the pair, and we talk about that. There\u2019s a parallel in the film with Kaluuya\u2019s own background, as his dad was in Uganda until he was 15, and Kaluuya definitely didn\u2019t want to contribute to what he calls the \u201cflattened narrative about black fathers\u201d. \u201cA lot of them just don\u2019t know how [to be fathers],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable thing to talk about, like: \u2018How does someone figure that out?\u2019 They have to process what they haven\u2019t had, or what they haven\u2019t seen. They\u2019re scared to make mistakes, and maybe a lot of the time it\u2019s probably best that some of them aren\u2019t involved in people\u2019s lives. And in the film\u2026 you want to explore the honesty of that. I don\u2019t think the film judges Izi, it just says he\u2019s going through some shit. And he\u2019s doing the best he can.\u201d After they wrapped the main part of the film, a few months later, Robinson and Bannerman had to shoot a couple of significant pick-up scenes. During that time off, Robinson became a father himself. \u201cAnd I just saw it all in a completely different way,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow, I don\u2019t think I could ever be like this with my son.\u2019 That super tough love. Knowing you\u2019ve done wrong, but also trying not to show it. But I understand how Izi got to that place.\u201d For much of the film, Izi doesn\u2019t really want to know Benji, so Benji hooks up with a local gang, led by Staples (Hope Ikpoku Jr), whose attitude is the opposite to Izi\u2019s. Staples welcomes Benji into his orphan family crew and urges him to join in their fight to stay in the Kitchen. For Kaluuya and Robinson, this is another of the movie\u2019s most important themes. Are you in or are you out? Do you leave, when you could stay and make it better? \u201cWhy do you want to make it better?\u201d says Kaluuya. \u201cThat\u2019s my thing. I watched all these films about working-class people, and the undercurrent is always, \u2018Where we\u2019re from is shit.\u2019 Like the writer is saying: \u2018I\u2019m really happy that I left. Look at what I left.\u2019 The end point is the leaving, that\u2019s the achievement. So with Izi, instead of his end point being leaving, I was like, how about his start point being \u2018I want to leave\u2019, and explore what kind of man is that. Let him evolve, see what might make him come back. Like The Wizard of Oz, there\u2019s no place like home\u2026\u201d \u201cLiving in London,\u201d says Robinson, \u201cthere\u2019s young boys growing up on the estate, talking about wanting to get out of the ends. That\u2019s all you hear. \u2018I want to get out of the ends. I want to play football and get out of the ends. I want to be a musician and get out of the ends\u2026\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I get it,\u201d says Kaluuya, \u201cwhen people have reasons to leave. But it\u2019s that thing of: \u2018Do you not like what it is? Do you not appreciate the beauty of it, the mindset of where it is and where you\u2019re from and what you\u2019re doing? The connection that you have?\u2019 Why can\u2019t we just be us?\u201d * * * Kaluuya grew up in Camden/Kentish Town, with his Ugandan mum, who works for a special educational needs school, and his older sister. He stayed on his estate, Camelot House, for many years, even after he got successful. He had his own little flat there, and would go and do an acting job, sometimes for months at a time, then come back. But, after a while, he found that this stopped working. Friends kept telling him he shouldn\u2019t stay, that things were different and people were moving on, other people moving in. The bedroom tax meant that families, when their children left home, couldn\u2019t afford to stay in their two- and three-bedroom places. They had to downsize and move out of the estate. And, gradually, he realised that he had to go, too. \u201cI was one of only three people that hadn\u2019t left, because I\u2019d worked hard to stay,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd everyone else had worked hard to leave. And so then it was like, what are you staying for if everyone\u2019s gone? What is your area? Is it the place? Or is it the people? I realised that it was the people. So for me, then there was nothing. But there\u2019s something to that place for a kid that\u2019s there now.\u201d Robinson is from East Ham. He grew up with his Jamaican parents and his brother at 69 Manor Road, as he says in T-Shirt Weather in the Manor; and then 86 St Olaves Road. It\u2019s a small terrace house, with a garden out back, where he spent his teenage years. He remembers it well. \u201cWith the garden, we took the fence away from the middle, between our house and our nextdoor neighbour, Teresa, and [her daughters] Claire and Sarah,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m older, I\u2019ve realised that my mum and Teresa would help each other. So if one didn\u2019t have any money, the other would do the shopping and then we\u2019d share, and then sometimes it\u2019d be vice versa. So they\u2019d come in through the back, get their dinner\u2026 that\u2019s how we worked. That\u2019s how we grew up. And you\u2019ll never see that again, you never have that same relationship with the neighbours and that.\u201d Robinson has long acknowledged how much where he grew up has shaped who he is. Not only in his lyrics, but in his YouTube series, Newham Talks, made during lockdown, where he interviewed other local artists \u2013 mostly grime stars \u2013 about their work. He always discusses their backgrounds, \u201cbecause where I grew up means that much to me,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was in a different business, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have moved.\u201d But, in the end, like Kaluuya, he did move. And many of their friends did too: acting, music and football, the main exit strategies. Partly because those things seemed within reach, but also, \u201cbecause they\u2019re cool, innit!\u201d says Kaluuya. \u201cThey\u2019re the things that you wanna be.\u201d Kaluuya has been acting since he was 13. He was a troublesome kid at school, noisy and clever. Aged nine, he won a playwriting competition and his play was performed at the Hampstead theatre. (The teachers didn\u2019t want him to win, because he was disruptive, but the judges insisted.) Aged 13, he joined Anna Scher theatre school after a plumber told his mum about it. Scher, who started her open-to-all theatre school in 1968, and who only quit teaching in 2020, died last year. Kaluuya says he learned everything from Scher\u2019s Saturday morning acting sessions. Mostly because he\u2019s never had a tougher audience: \u201cEverything was completely improvised, and if you were rubbish, they\u2019d just laugh at you. And if you were boring, then they\u2019re playing Snake [a phone game].\u201d What Kaluuya learned, he says, is that he wasn\u2019t entitled to people\u2019s attention, that he had to give something that was \u201cworthy of someone leaning in, laughing along, listening\u201d. He went to Anna Scher every weekend for three years and realised that \u201cimprov is a way of writing on your feet, creating a story in that moment\u201d. He still uses some of the techniques he learned there. He went to Camden Roundhouse, too, for acting classes, and recently, with others, he\u2019s begun to set up a similar thing for local kids. \u201c\u00a32 classes,\u201d he explains, \u201cbecause a lot of the cheap acting classes that I went to when I was a kid don\u2019t exist any more. And everyone likes to complain and I just don\u2019t like it. I\u2019m like, What are we gonna do about it? So when they said, Do you wanna join the Roundhouse as associate artistic director I said: \u2018Yes, and let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d Still, it\u2019s Anna Scher that was really important to him, and another thing that stays with him from his days there is Scher\u2019s idea of collectivism. She taught the kids that if their friend got a job, then they all got a job, that nobody in the room was competition, even if they were auditioning for the same part. Kaluuya still takes that into his acting: \u201cWhen I come in the game, I come in happy,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, how are we going to make this work? Because if you\u2019re whack, I\u2019m whack. If I\u2019m whack, you\u2019re whack.\u201d Robinson nods. He was a talented footballer when he was young, playing for junior teams at Chelsea and Norwich City before he was 13, but, he says, \u201cthough football is obviously a team game, I really felt like I was more a part of a team with Deja Vu, the pirate radio station. A lot of what you\u2019ve described is the same stuff I experienced through music and pirate radio.\u201d Deja Vu was based on the rooftops of Hackney Wick and brought through many grime and rap artists: Kano, obviously, but also Dizzee Rascal, Ghetts, Tinchy Stryder, Lethal Bizzle and others. Robinson started going there when he was around 15. \u201cIt was the place we all went to express ourselves. Like-minded people, collaboration, back to back, sharing a mic.\u201d The budding rappers would hang out together, go to one another\u2019s houses to write. \u201cJust pushing each other. You\u2019ve got your book, I\u2019ve got my book, we\u2019ve got a beat on, we just sit there and we just write. We could have done it separately, but for some reason, just coming together, not even talking, just coming together, being in the same place, being creative, that was it. We did it all ourselves.\u201d He hadn\u2019t found that in football: \u201cI was decent at it, but the same level of passion wasn\u2019t there.\u201d With music, he woke up thinking about it, and it taught him self-sufficiency: saving money to pay for an hour in a mixing studio, then playing the track out on Deja, and if it worked, maybe pressing a hundred records, taking them to shops, sale or return\u2026 When he talks about this time, he lights up. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cSmall steps.\u201d \u201cMusic has informed how I approach acting,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a writer, I\u2019m not going to leave who I am creatively at the door, just because I\u2019m in another medium. I\u2019m going to approach it in the same way. So I need to understand the world, understand the lines, in order to be able to do it with my whole chest. I need to believe, in order to make you believe.\u201d And music, clearly, is wrapped around both of their lives. When I ask them how they keep in touch, Robinson says that Kaluuya just sends him invites to parties \u2013 \u201cIf I\u2019m about, I\u2019ll go!\u201d Kaluuya rolls his eyes: \u201cIf he\u2019s about\u2026\u201d \u2013 but they also share music. They tell me about Tobe Nwigwe, from Houston, Texas, whose music Kaluuya discovered on Instagram during lockdown. Kaluuya got in touch with him \u2013 of course he did \u2013 and now Nwigwe comes and sees him whenever he\u2019s in London. \u201cHe\u2019s a cool guy\u2026\u201d Music and film and football, a bit, though Robinson doesn\u2019t care about it much any more, and Kaluuya, a huge Arsenal fan, can\u2019t watch matches, because he gets too wound up\u2026 And then the time is up, and they have things to do, and they laugh their way out of the room, which feels frou-frou and curly and quiet and boring, after they leave. The Kitchen is in select UK cinemas and on Netflix now",

        "body": "There are shades of Petite Maman and All of Us Strangers in the slickly packaged, Margot Robbie-produced Sundance comedy My Old Ass, taking a similarly magical high-concept \u201cwhat if?\u201d but with a far frothier touch. Premiering at a coveted big Saturday night slot, it arrives during a festival that has buyers on high alert, schedules lightened by last year\u2019s strikes pausing production. While the old-fashioned Sundance crowd-pleaser might have become less commercially viable in recent years thanks to both audience and industry shifts (films like Blinded by the Light, Late Night, Brittany Runs a Marathon and Flora and Son going from big sales to little audiences), it still feels like an easy win, easily winning over a packed-out cinema of festival-goers. Set in those emotionally complicated few weeks before the first year of college, My Old Ass centres on Elliott (Maisy Stella), a queer teen living in the idyll of the Muskoka Lakes in Canada (the film doubles up as a persuasive tourism ad). Choosing to spend her remaining days hooking up with a local girl and getting high, she leaves her family to anxiously await her departure alone, believably selfish rather than monstrous teen behaviour. When Elliott takes some mushrooms with her two closest friends, she\u2019s met with her older self (Aubrey Plaza), a head-scratcher that she chalks up to the trip rather than a crack in the the fabric of the universe. But when she returns to the sober light of day, she finds that her future self has left her number in her phone and the two engage in a phone relationship, the older Elliott trying to impart wisdom. Along with the more expected advice about strengthening relationships with the family members she has taken for granted, younger Elliott is told above all else to stay away from Chad, a befuddling priority that becomes impossible when she finally meets him. How could someone so seemingly flawless be such catastrophically bad news? What follows is a shaggy and immensely likeable comedy, playing out as if it were based on a slightly cruder than usual YA novel. The actor turned film-maker Megan Park, acting as both writer and director, smartly makes Elliott\u2019s last few weeks feel refreshingly low-stakes \u2013 she isn\u2019t some hellish teen rampaging against her loving family, but just a slightly thoughtless one in need of only minor tweaks rather than some major makeover. Park\u2019s first movie (the delicate school shooting drama The Fallout) had shown an impressive knack for nailing the specific rhythms of teen speech \u2013 unforced, real and undressed \u2013 and despite subject matter that others either avoid completely or give a pat PSA glow, she found truth in the face of possible cliche. Things are far more heightened here, but Park displays a similar ability to ground material that others would have made impossible to fully believe. As fantastical as things get, she finds a tone that both embraces the goofiness of the setup while also selling us on how real people handle an unreal situation. The life lessons that Park is leading us to are never unexpected \u2013 appreciate the freedom of youth, embrace what mistakes can teach you, be nicer to your parents \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t make them any less effective and as the last act comes into view, Park pushes the film\u2019s sad-around-the-edges melancholy into the spotlight. There\u2019s a surprisingly grand emotional punch, arriving suddenly and landing with force. While it\u2019s pegged to a reveal that we\u2019ve seen before, it\u2019s handled so well that it is impossible not to be moved, a thoughtful reflection on what really constitutes a bad life choice. I\u2019d argue that some of the relationships are a little rushed (the film could have benefitted from a longer runtime, arguably one of the greatest compliments at a time of such bloat), with Elliott\u2019s relationship to her parents in need of a few more beats. A scene between Elliott and her mother (a wonderful Maria Dizzia) is sad and lovely, a familiar wrench of having to let go of someone and allow that relationship to mature and change, but more of that wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. Stella is a sensational find, known mostly for her role in TV\u2019s Nashville, a smart and instinctive young actor with a roughness around the edges that separates her from the slick unnaturalness of the many grown-up Disney kids that act as her industry peers (she\u2019s also a fantastic singer, which leads to a sweet Justin Bieber-inspired sequence). Plaza, who has really found herself as an actor at Sundance delivering her finest, most revealing work in films like Ingrid Goes West and Emily the Criminal, is fantastic \u2013 the kind of A-game performer who really never misses, and the pair have a real, tender rapport. Rather like recent sleeper hit Anyone But You, it also looks as glossy and poppy as a studio comedy from the 2000s, a rich treat at a time when that has become the rare exception rather than the rule. It deserves to find an equally big audience, for asses both young and old. My Old Ass is showing at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distribution.",

        "body": "We are almost through January, which is one of the hardest months. I always think of January and February as being the offspring of Spartan parents: no mollycoddling and left on a mountainside to survive or die. What better antidote to this than chocolate? I started with Lina Stores Cioccolato Bianco al Caff\u00e8, \u00a38.95/100g, a white chocolate bar filled with coffee gianduia. (Lina stores used to sell the best pandoro ever made, by Brera Milano, but no longer; if anyone sees this for sale LMK.) White chocolate and coffee is satisfyingly sweet and comforting for this time of year. I recently discovered, via a free sample handed out at a Christmas fair, Lindt\u2019s Caramel with a Touch of Sea Salt, \u00a31.95/100g. It\u2019s not super dark, but at 47% cocoa it feels dark and the crunch of caramel gives it some interest. A good one if you are a dark-choc lover, but still need a bit of comfort. And, as we\u2019ve established, that\u2019s everyone at this time of year. Also: Toblerone. Nothing has ever beaten the sensation of locking jaws on one of its duty free-size pieces and, although I find it almost unbearably sweet these days, I do have a bar of its Orange Twist (with ginger), \u00a35/360g, on my desk for moments of gloom. At the other end of the scale for the craft chocolate aficionados, I have a wonderful treat. Table\u2019s Tanzania 72%, \u00a36.50/70g. With a conching time of 72 hours (I love the geeky details they put on their wrappers), this is slow-melt, super smooth, highly flavoured, very low acidity tasting chocolate. It rightly won Silver at the Academy of Chocolate Awards in 2022. Follow Annalisa on X @AnnalisaB",

        "body": "A British cellist who played at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has said Rule, Britannia! \u201cmakes people feel uncomfortable\u201d and should not be sung at the Last Night of the Proms. Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who became the first black person to win the BBC Young Musician award in 2016, performed as a soloist at the final concert of the annual two-month orchestral event last year \u2013 but said he did not stay to hear Rule, Britannia! being sung at the end of the night. The patriotic song ignited controversy in 2020 when the Sunday Times reported that the BBC was discussing ditching Rule, Britannia! at that year\u2019s Proms. While many embraced the opportunity to discuss alternatives with more universal appeal, traditionalists expressed dismay at what was perceived to be an attack on British culture. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs, Kanneh-Mason said he did not think the song should be included in Last Night of the Proms, and that \u201cso much wonderful music\u201d could replace it. \u201cI think maybe some people don\u2019t realise how uncomfortable a song like that can make a lot of people feel, even if it makes [the people singing it] feel good,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s somehow a big misunderstanding about it.\u201d Kanneh-Mason suggested the song could be replaced with British folk music: \u201cThere is so much wonderful British music. The wealth of folk music from this country is astonishing. \u201cThere is so much that is worth celebrating and having as part of a big celebration at the end of a wonderful music festival.\u201d Responding to Kanneh-Mason\u2019s comments, a BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThe Proms are built on longstanding traditions that were established by co-founder Sir Henry Wood, and which are loved by people around the world. \u201cOne of these traditions is the last night festivities. Other traditions include promoting new music, accessibility and opening up the world of classical music to as many people as possible.\u201d Kanneh-Mason, who was born and raised in Nottingham, appeared alongside his siblings on the ITV variety show Britain\u2019s Got Talent in 2015. His album Inspiration, which was reported in February 2018 to have been \u201cthe biggest-selling British debut of the year to date\u201d, reached No 1 on the UK classical albums chart.",

I\u2019ve been a comedian for 25 years. How long have you been an audience?\u201d Which I thought was a nice parting dig. Then I went off and the organiser said: \u201cOK, fair enough.

There are some towns in the UK that simply do not have a decent pub to their name and that\u2019s when you get thwarted. What\u2019s your current show, Tragedy Plus Time, about? It is an examination of the idea that comedy can be defined as tragedy plus time, and is done through the examination of a particular tragedy in my life, which happened two years ago, which was the death of my little brother. It sounds pretty depressing, but it\u2019s a very funny show. Does it take a toll talking about something so personal night after night? What\u2019s very weird about it and what I discovered very early on is that I can, if I choose to, almost not listen to myself as I\u2019m talking. On the first three shows I cried every time because the material was new and it was all very emotional for me. One night, the audience didn\u2019t really feel onboard and I didn\u2019t shed one tear. I just did a soulless, emotionless run-through of the show for them. I found that I could, if I needed to, detach myself from the show. But the better the audience, the more emotional I get. Any bugbears from the world of comedy? I am slightly concerned about how polarised the scene is becoming. We seem to be splintering into this weird woke versus anti-woke factionalism that I find quite sad. When I became a comedian, I really felt I\u2019d found my tribe. I enjoyed the camaraderie of comedy and the fact that you can completely disagree with somebody, but we all felt like outsiders and misfits. Now it just feels like a lot of comedians are spending a lot of time talking about what other comedians are doing rather than just trying to be funny. Do you think there\u2019s enough TV opportunities today for new comedians? There was an explosion of panel shows in the 90s that were fairly rubbish. It became slightly over-saturated, and they became a byword for crap light entertainment television. Then when Mock the Week and 8 Out of 10 Cats came along, it really hit that the panel show was the most efficient comedy delivery system. Before Live at the Apollo, there was still the idea that standup didn\u2019t really work on mainstream TV and that the panel show was the best way to get comedians on TV and have them be funny. I\u2019ve been in the industry so long there\u2019s no point asking me what my advice is for young comedians. I think apart from Taskmaster, there isn\u2019t a show any more that can make a career in the old way that TV used to, so everybody\u2019s moving online. I\u2019m doing it myself. I\u2019ve paid a woman 20 years younger than me to chop up my old DVDs and stick them out on Instagram and TikTok in 30-second chunks. Worst advice you\u2019ve ever been given? Early on, when I was on the dole, I was disappointed to not get to the final of So You Think You\u2019re Funny. People were so philosophical: \u201cYou\u2019re young. It\u2019s all ahead of you. Enjoy the journey.\u201d But I was fucking broke. I wanted to work and thought: I\u2019ll enjoy the journey after I start making a living. I did enjoy it eventually, but at the time that was not useful advice. Best advice you\u2019ve ever been given? Talk less. Comedy is a people business and you do well to not annoy other people. \u2022 Ed Byrne: Tragedy Plus Time is on tour",

        "body": "If you watched Strictly Come Dancing in 2018, chances are Johannes Radebe caught your eye. He wasn\u2019t yet known, but, through the group dances performed by the professionals, it became clear that Radebe was a star who couldn\u2019t be contained for long. A year later, he was given his first celebrity partner (the actor Catherine Tyldesley) and performed the series\u2019 first same-sex dance \u2013 in heels, no less \u2013 with his fellow dancer Graziano Di Prima. Vogueing in black stilettos alongside Di Prima felt like \u201cmy coming-out party\u201d, he says: \u201cThere was something very empowering about saying: this is who I am. I said to myself: enough of the shame, enough of hiding, just enough.\u201d By 2021, when he was dancing with the baker John Whaite as one half of the show\u2019s first male couple, Radebe had become one of Strictly\u2019s most beloved stars. Leaving aside his stage outfits \u2013 a green beaded jumpsuit was a highlight in the most recent series \u2013 Radebe has been known to step out in heels and a ballgown for special occasions, such as when Strictly picked up a National Television award last year. Today, though, he is dressed in sportswear, a big quilted coat protecting him from the cold. A few days ago, Radebe, who is South African, took the Life in the UK test in preparation to settle here. It was hard, he says, but he passed. \u201cI got out of there thinking I might be deported,\u201d he says, smiling. With the test \u2013 and the months of studying \u2013 over, Radebe has thrown himself into creating his third dance show, House of Jojo, which begins its UK tour at the end of March. It\u2019s a stretch to say that a piece of immigration bureaucracy inspired the show, but it made him wonder about the overlaps. What is the history of House of Jojo? What are its values? \u201cI really want it to reflect the world I live in,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have been given opportunities by coming to this country. It is made up of a lot of people that come from outside. As long as you obey the law, you\u2019re guaranteed democracy and freedom. There is space to exist.\u201d Radebe is the draw, of course, but House of Jojo is about bringing others along. He has assembled a diverse cast of dancers, including some from places where it\u2019s hard to get a UK visa. Others have been denied opportunities in the past because they don\u2019t fit the traditional idea of how a dancer should look. \u201cIt\u2019s been a beautiful process, because I\u2019m not alone during this,\u201d he says of his creative team. Radebe says he wouldn\u2019t be where he is without the people who helped him: his local community, which chipped in for transport to dance competitions; his coaches, who spent hours nurturing him; the power brokers who gave him chances once his career was quickstepping along. \u201cI\u2019m not blind to the fact that it was everybody\u2019s effort,\u201d he says. Radebe grew up in Zamdela, a mining township in the Free State, in the final years of apartheid. He was too young to be much aware of it; he didn\u2019t question why, when driving through white suburbs in a minibus on the way to church, some people had huge houses and swimming pools behind barbed-wire fences, while his family lived in a small bungalow, in which he shared a room with his older sister and his grandmother. \u201cYou just think: \u2018This is where I come from and this is where they come from,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cNow, understanding the fear \u2013 to know that our parents lived in fear while they were raising kids \u2013 that still affects our society. There\u2019s a gap that needs to be bridged \u2013 and soon, because it\u2019s dire what\u2019s happening to youngsters in South Africa. So, have I experienced apartheid? No, but do I know the effects of it? I see them every day.\u201d As a child, did he know he was different from other boys? \u201cFrom the start,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cIn terms of mannerisms, things I was interested in \u2013 Barbies were my thing.\u201d He loved to make clothes for his sister\u2019s dolls and dress them; when his father, who worked for Coca-Cola, gave the children money to spend in a shop, Radebe chose his own doll. When his parents discovered this, it was met with silence, but not shaming. That came when Radebe started school. He was marked out as a \u201csissy boy\u201d. Sometimes, he would be chased home by boys and threatened with violence. Even adults would verbally abuse him. \u201cConservative beliefs,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018An African is an African and a man is a man.\u2019 That is my Zulu uncles talking.\u201d Later, they would constantly ask him when he would find a wife: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThose were daily conversations.\u201d There were glimmers of light \u2013 his mother was supportive and he made friends with two other boys who were going through the same thing. But mostly it was about survival: \u201cI used to hide a lot. I would run away from anything threatening.\u201d He felt relaxed with his sister or his friends around, \u201cbut the minute people disappeared, I never felt safe\u201d. It must have been frightening, I say. \u201cFrightening, yes,\u201d he says, softly. One of his friends was beaten up so badly, after being spotted playing with dolls with Radebe, that he missed school. It is no exaggeration to say that dance saved Radebe. He stumbled into a class at the local recreation hall by accident when he was seven, and fell in love. It rebuilt his self-esteem and confidence and his growing reputation as a dancer offered a level of protection from his attackers. It also provided an outlet when his family life fell apart and his parents separated. Radebe says it gave him \u201ca sense of belonging, a sense of worth. To get applause made me feel like somebody, for however long it lasted. I knew there was a world where I didn\u2019t have to feel ashamed, because people understood where I came from. When I went back into the real world, everything seemed so bland. That dance world was sparkly, kind, it was accommodating.\u201d Radebe started competing in Latin and ballroom competitions, raising money from neighbours to pay for transport and accommodation. His world was opening, but so were his eyes. It was the first time he really saw the inequalities of race and class. Competitions weren\u2019t based on talent alone; grooming and presentation were vital. The couples with better, more expensive costumes \u2013 almost always white \u2013 would take the top prizes. He remembers, after coming fourth, asking one of the judges for advice on how he and his partner might improve. \u201cI remember him saying: \u2018You will never win. Look at you, you look unkempt.\u2019 And to my partner: \u2018Your body type is wrong for this dance.\u2019\u201d As one of the top couples in their province, Radebe and his partner had been invited to compete internationally, but that was financially impossible. Some rival couples paid for private tuition with adjudicators before competitions, but that wasn\u2019t an option. It felt as though kids from townships could never win. \u201cIf I had to dwell on that, I wouldn\u2019t have survived this industry or this world,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is why there\u2019s so few of us. But it was painful. There\u2019s a million times when I felt: why am I even trying?\u201d They were often the only Black couple to make the finals. \u201cMy coach used to say: \u2018Listen to the audience; they will let you know whether you won or not.\u2019\u201d Radebe and his partner would get the loudest cheers, but not the highest scores. His partner walked away. \u201cShe said: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this, it\u2019s not fun.\u2019 I was stupid enough to hold on, because I didn\u2019t know what to do without this.\u201d He laughs, but he is downplaying his determination. Was he always so strong? He takes a long pause. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve had people that loved me hard, that showed me that whatever I wanted in life, I could achieve, and that\u2019s what got me through it,\u201d he says. It was partly about being young in the nascent post-apartheid era. He was constantly told how lucky he was: \u201cYou were reminded with breakfast, lunch and dinner, every time your mother had an opportunity to remind you that you have been afforded an opportunity to make something of your life.\u201d Did it feel like pressure, or empowering? \u201cIt felt both \u2013 and it left a lot of people crippled. I look at my own family and the lack of education, lack of opportunity, has led to a desperation in people. It does boil down to you as an individual to make a choice, that I\u2019m not going to accept what has been dealt to me. There are people that have risen above that and there are people that haven\u2019t been able to.\u201d Radebe\u2019s mother was persuaded to let him leave home at 13 and move in with a dance coach couple in a different province; they had spotted his potential and could offer him bigger opportunities in nearby Johannesburg. He hoped going to a new school would be better, but the homophobic bullying was worse. \u201cI was trying to stand my ground and stand up to my bullies, but I would be bashed,\u201d he says. Once, he was viciously attacked in the school toilets by a group of boys. On the day of his final exam, he remembers telling himself that he never had to return. \u201cI wanted to leave that world far behind. And I have.\u201d He was cast in a stage show, then became a dance teacher in Johannesburg, but he was earning so little that he couldn\u2019t afford an apartment. Instead, he would pay friendly taxi drivers a small amount to sleep in the back of their cabs, or he would secretly stay overnight in the dance studio. Going to gay clubs, Radebe became aware that there was often a transactional relationship between older white men and young Black men. Sometimes, he would ask to stay in a spare room, but made it clear there would be nothing in it for them; often, they let him. When one of these men tried to sexually assault him, Radebe escaped. His life, he decided, had become too unstable and dangerous. A friend encouraged him to audition for a job as a dancer on cruise ships; he spent the next seven years performing. Then he was cast in South Africa\u2019s version of Strictly, but couldn\u2019t let go of the fact that he hadn\u2019t yet won a South African dance title. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let those adjudicators tell me that I was never going to win. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. I won the [national Latin] title, not once, but twice.\u201d He smiles. As the reigning champion, he fired off a confident email to the producers of Burn the Floor, a successful ballroom and Latin show of which he was desperate to be a part. Touring with that show, he caught the eye of the producers of British Strictly and was asked to join the cast. Being invited on to the original show felt like validation: \u201cIt felt like I was being rewarded for sticking it out.\u201d It has changed his life, he says, and his family\u2019s life. \u201cI know that my family is OK and that is what I\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d he says. Radebe\u2019s father died when he was a teenager; he has always considered himself his family\u2019s breadwinner. Recently, he was able to build his mother a house. It had always been his dream to dance with another man. When he started dancing at seven, he asked if he could dance with a boy and was told no. \u201cYou can imagine what it did for my shame, thinking that I always had to hide that about me. I\u2019ve always asked myself: what would that feel like? The fact that we got to do it, I knew how many people would have looked at that moment and felt seen.\u201d In the 2021 series, he and Whaite \u2013 not only the first male couple, but also the first gay partnership \u2013 reached the final. In any other year, they would have won (they were beaten by the luminous Rose Ayling-Ellis). I challenge anyone to watch their last dance, completely joyful and free, and not well up. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what that has done for so many people, and I hear the stories still today,\u201d says Radebe. \u201cThat\u2019s how I know that we\u2019ve left the world a better place, just by doing what we do. It\u2019s humbling, and it feels great to be part of history in that regard. I would have loved to exist in a world where I didn\u2019t have to be ashamed of myself. There was never anything wrong with me, yet the society around me made me believe there was.\u201d To have such support from the public felt like \u201ca hug\u201d, he says. \u201cAfter that you couldn\u2019t touch me. I can\u2019t tell you what it did for my confidence. Thanks to John, as well. My relationships have changed since then with people in my life that are close to me.\u201d His uncles stopped asking when he would be finding a wife. This isn\u2019t to say it has been easy. He is careful now with social media, because the abuse got so bad: \u201cPeople would tell me and John that we were disgusting, that I should never come back to Africa, that I\u2019m a disgrace.\u201d He has learned not to engage and to try to ignore it. \u201cI\u2019ve created a world where that has no impact on me any more. It\u2019s not me that has a problem. If they\u2019re willing to learn, come to House of Jojo; I\u2019ll educate you. What I do, and how I live my life, can never be based on what other people think. I want to create a world that I see in my head \u2013 and it\u2019s of love and of kindness.\u201d Later, I spend a lovely afternoon rewatching clips of Radebe dancing \u2013 it\u2019s a strange alchemy of precision, energy and lightness \u2013 but mostly I think about the little boy, bullied, ashamed and disadvantaged, who just kept going. \u201cHonestly, never in my wildest dreams,\u201d he had said earlier, about his career. None of it was planned and there were plenty of people who told him he would never make it. \u201cI pinch myself, because I\u2019m like: how? But I\u2019ve got incredible people that hold me up. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve survived. It was never about money, it was never about being known. I\u2019ve always danced because it brought me happiness and joy.\u201d House of Jojo tours the UK from 29 March",

        "body": "The UK\u2019s super-rich \u201cwould never leave the country for tax reasons\u201d because they fear they would be \u201cbored to death\u201d in \u201cculturally barren\u201d tax havens, according to new research by experts at the London School of Economics. Researchers at the LSE interviewed 35 members of the UK\u2019s richest 1% \u2013 by wealth or income \u2013 and found that none said they would leave the UK for tax reasons. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go to a tax haven. Can you imagine anything worse than going to a tax haven?\u201d one of the respondents, Leanne, who works in consulting, told the researchers. \u201cSome tiny little place with just people with yachts and servants. So no, I wouldn\u2019t leave for that kind of reason \u2026 I want to live in a vibrant economic climate where there\u2019s room for innovation and, you know, people are inventing, and I think London is like that.\u201d Another respondent, Luke, who works in law, said: \u201cI have a nice life here [in London]. My clients who moved to the Bahamas were bored to death. Sun, sea and sand. OK, it\u2019s great for a couple of weeks to charge the batteries, but after a while you think, \u2018Well, I\u2019d quite like to go and watch an opera.\u2019 Well, you can forget that \u2013 there\u2019s not a theatre in the Bahamas.\u201d Bea and Peter, a couple who both work in finance, said that if they \u201cmove to the Middle East, [you] are in gated communities and stuff like that. I never found that attractive in any way.\u201d Marianne, who works in culture, said the suggestion that there would be a \u201cbig brain drain\u201d if the government introduced higher taxes on the wealthy was \u201ccomplete nonsense. And I will give you the answer why in two words, and that is National Gallery or National Theatre \u2026 that\u2019s why people aren\u2019t going to leave London.\u201d The research by the International Inequalities Institute at the LSE found that the super-rich feared the societal \u201cstigma attached to tax migration\u201d. \u201cInterviewees were disparaging about those who chose to move for tax purposes,\u201d the research paper said. \u201cSome judged tax migrants on moral grounds as unduly economically self-interested, while others expressed a snobbery about tax-advantageous destinations as boring and culturally barren.\u201d The research comes as public and political debate focuses on tax ahead of the general election expected later this year. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, last week indicated that there may be big tax cuts in his March budget, in what was seen as one of the last opportunities for the Conservatives to claw back Labour\u2019s lead in the opinion polls. \u201cI believe fundamentally that low-tax economies are more dynamic, more competitive,\u201d he said. Hunt has come under pressure to cut taxes amid forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility that they are heading for their highest level since the 1940s. Meanwhile, trade unions, the Green party and some members of the super-rich have called for the introduction of wealth taxes to help pay for battered public services. A \u201cmodest\u201d 1.7% wealth tax on the richest 140,000 people in the UK could raise more than \u00a310bn to help pay for public services, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) suggested last year, but Labour and the Liberal Democrats have ruled out introducing such a tax. While none of the super-rich people interviewed for the paper, entitled Tax Flight?, Britain\u2019s Wealthiest and Their Attachment to Place, said they were planning to leave over tax, many said they were concerned that the top tax rates in the UK were currently too high and would rise further. \u201cA minority of interviewees said they would not rule out tax migration, but only if the political and economic conditions in Britain changed dramatically,\u201d the paper said. \u201cA return to top tax rates seen in the 1970s or a Jeremy Corbyn-style government were frequently cited as \u2018red-line\u2019 conditions.\u201d Sam Friedman, professor of sociology at LSE and lead author of the research, said: \u201cWe need to challenge the prevailing assumption that if you tax the rich, they will leave. \u201cThe rich are not only strongly embedded, but they are also acutely aware of the stigma of tax migration \u2013 of being seen as unduly self-interested or moving to places others consider culturally barren and boring.\u201d",

        "body": "Anthony Albanese has continued to raise expectations of further cost-of-living relief as some backbench MPs debate the possibility Labor could modify stage-three income tax cuts to pay for new measures. On Monday the prime minister said \u201cif we can find ways to put extra dollars in people\u2019s pockets, particularly those low and middle income earners who are doing it tough, then we\u2019re prepared to do so\u201d. Albanese confirmed that by Wednesday\u2019s caucus meeting the government will have received advice about \u201chow we can take pressure off cost of living\u201d, reiterating that it had \u201calways said that will continue to look for ways to assist people\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working away throughout January and what we\u2019ll be looking at [on Wednesday], of course, is the advice that we\u2019ve received about how we can take pressure off cost of living,\u201d Albanese told Sky News. While backbench MPs are pleased at the renewed focus on the cost of living for low and middle income earners, Labor is divided between those who want to see a renovation of stage-three tax cuts to improve fairness and those who warn this would arm Peter Dutton with a potent argument that the government has breached an election promise. The tax cuts, passed by the Morrison government in mid-2019 with Labor support after it failed to split the bill, begin in July 2024. They remove the $120,000 to $180,000 tax bracket, increase the top tax bracket to $200,000 and reduce the marginal rate of tax for everyone earning between $45,000 and $200,000 to 30%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The stage-three tax cuts reduce tax revenue by $320bn over 10 years, and could be renovated to save the budget up to $130bn while still delivering bigger tax cuts to 80% of income earners, according to the Australia Institute. On Monday 2GB Radio reported that the government is considering increasing the tax free threshold to benefit low and middle income earners, and making the stage three cuts less generous for high income earners by retaining the $180,000 threshold for the top bracket. A government spokesperson said \u201cthe government\u2019s plans have not changed\u201d. On Wednesday Albanese said that \u201ctax cuts will happen in July\u201d but did not specifically recommit to stage-three, instead observing that \u201cat the moment, these cuts cut in at $45,000\u201d. One Labor MP said although they didn\u2019t think it was in Australia\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d to have committed to tax cuts, which predominantly benefit high income earners, before the election, \u201cwe\u2019ll never hear the end of it\u201d if Labor breaks its promise. The MP said the government should \u201cstick to what we said we\u2019d do\u201d, although it might be possible to cut out the \u201ctop one or 2% of income earners who don\u2019t need it\u201d. \u201cThe average person wouldn\u2019t complain about that,\u201d the MP said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how brave we\u2019ll be \u2013 we\u2019ll find out on Wednesday.\u201d Others were more adamant that any modification on stage-three would be electorally costly \u2013 particularly if it turned the 2 March Dunkley byelection and 2025 federal election into referendums on deviating from repeated promises to maintain the cuts. Another MP said it was \u201cproblematic\u201d to see \u201ceverything through the prism frozen in time\u201d at the point the cuts were passed because \u201cthe world is changing so rapidly\u201d. \u201cSurely there is capacity for a sensible government to tweak the tax cuts appropriately,\u201d the MP said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who need it more than income earners on politicians\u2019 wages.\u201d Labor would probably not need Coalition support to amend stage-three tax cuts, given the Greens and key crossbench senators Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock have all called for them to be reformed. But on Thursday, Dutton, the opposition leader, warned that Albanese\u2019s leadership would be \u201cover if he abandons the stage-three tax cuts because Australians have seen this movie before and they don\u2019t reward leaders who go to an election with an ironclad guarantee, and then knowingly break it\u201d. \u201cThere will be a lot of people who make the application to the bank at the moment, maybe to refinance, try and lock in a lower interest rate over the next couple of years if they can find one, and they will be relying on that additional income coming into their budget,\u201d Dutton told 2GB Radio. Labor MP Brian Mitchell, who pushed the treasurer Jim Chalmers to speak to backbenchers about the rising cost of living back in November, is one of a number of MPs who want more done for middle income earners. Mitchell said Labor had done \u201cdone well for those on low incomes and concession card holders\u201d who benefited from energy relief, but that people \u201care being squeezed in the middle\u201d. Labor MP Maria Vamvakinou said changes like an increase in jobseeker and rent assistance would be \u201cuseful and relevant to middle Australia and lower [socioeconomic status] households\u201d. \u201cI do have renters in my electorate but a large part of households are in newly acquired homes. Interest rates have made a negative impact on their ability to keep up.\u201d On Monday Albanese argued that the total of $23bn of cost-of-living relief already delivered had been \u201cdesigned to provide assistance but also [put] downward pressure on inflation\u201d, citing cheaper medicines, fee-free Tafe and energy price relief. An extension of energy price relief passed in December 2022, which included caps on coal prices and rebates for some consumers, is considered among the measures most likely to be adopted to help households. The energy bill relief remains a popular move among Labor MPs, but several claimed voters were not necessarily giving major credit to the government for that change, since the help reduces bills before they reach the consumer. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, refused to comment on the possible extension of energy price relief, telling reporters in Sydney he would not pre-empt cabinet and caucus deliberations.",

        "body": "The Two Homes Oh! If the soul immortal be, Is not its love immortal too? Seest thou my home? \u2014 \u2019Tis where yon woods are waving In their dark richness, to the sunny air: Where yon blue stream, a thousand flower-banks laving, Leads down the hills a vein of light \u2014 \u2019tis there! Midst these green haunts how many a spring lies gleaming, Fringed with the violet, coloured with the skies, My boyhood\u2019s haunt, through days of summer dreaming, Under young leaves that shook with melodies! My home! \u2014 the spirit of its love is breathing In every wind that plays upon my track, From its white walls the very tendrils wreathing Seem with soft links to draw the wanderer back. There am I loved \u2014 there prayed for! \u2014 there my mother Sits by the hearth with meekly thoughtful eye, There my young sisters watch to greet their brother; Soon their glad footsteps down the path will fly! There, in sweet strains of kindred music blending, All the home-voices meet at day\u2019s decline; One are those tones, as from one heart descending \u2014 there laughs my home. Sad stranger! where is thine? \u2014 Ask\u2019st thou of mine? \u2014 in solemn peace \u2018tis lying Far o\u2019er the deserts and the tombs away; \u2019Tis where I too am loved, with love undying, And fond hearts wait my step \u2014 But where are they? And where the earth\u2019s departed have their dwelling, Ask of the clouds, the stars, the trackless air! \u2013 I know it not \u2014 yet trust the whisper, telling My lonely heart, that love unchanged is there. And what is home, and where, but with the loving? Happy thou art, that so canst gaze on thine! My spirit feels, but in its weary roving, There with the dead, where\u2019er they be, is mine. Go to thy home, rejoicing son and brother! Bear in fresh gladness to the household scene! For me, too, watch the sister and the mother, I will believe \u2014 but dark seas roll between. This return-visit to the work of Felicia Dorothea Hemans (1793-1835) highlights a less familiar poem than the previous choice Casabianca. The Two Homes, first published in Songs of the Affections (1830) doesn\u2019t initially declare its form as dialogue. It appears that Hemans, in typical Romantic style, is addressing her readers with her delight in the inextricability of home and nature. From the first verse I\u2019d single out the images of the woods \u201cwaving / in their dark richness\u201d and the stream as \u201ca vein of light\u201d as most distinctive. The second verse suggests multiple rivulets (\u201cmany a spring\u201d), so the setting is easily imagined as a hill in Hemans\u2019s \u201cadopted\u201d north Wales. There\u2019s fresh surprise in verse two, which reveals the speaker to be male. From \u201cboyhood\u2019s haunt\u201d the description moves naturally to the home itself, the white-washed exterior whose tendrils \u201cseem with soft links to draw the wanderer back\u201d. These tendrils aren\u2019t explained: shorn of specific detail, the word works on the reader\u2019s imagination. I thought first of the vines in Keats\u2019s ode To Autumn. The domestic scene is captured well, if predictably, in verse four. The next adds a fresher dimension. The \u201chome-voices\u201d (an appealing coinage) are metaphorical music (and they might become actual music, if the sisters add singing to the evening\u2019s entertainment). Family harmony, whether spoken or sung, lulls the speaker into further delight: \u201cThere laughs my home.\u201d But this is the signal for a re-focus. Another presence is declared, in a deft act of poetic and conversational timing provoked by the word home: \u201cSad stranger! where is thine?\u201d Hemans brings this second speaker poignantly into view. The emphasis (\u201cAsk\u2019st thou of mine?\u201d), echoing the earlier \u201cthine\u201d, makes us wait, fills the pause with questioning anticipation. That the stranger\u2019s family is dead becomes swiftly apparent: the phrase \u201csolemn peace\u201d can imply nothing else. But the mystery lingers for the reader. Where are the physical remains located? Where is the stranger from? The distance evoked (\u201co\u2019er the deserts and the tombs away\u201d) implies not only the distance between death and life. It suggests the stranger has travelled far. We\u2019re not told the gender, but the poem\u2019s underlying realism favours a male, perhaps a homeless ex-soldier or other recognisable migrant. The remainder of the poem holds in balance the migrant\u2019s sense that the lost loved ones are still intensely present, and that, at the same time, he\u2019s disturbed because they cannot be located somewhere other than \u201cthe clouds, the stars, the trackless air\u201d. Resisting closure while returning to the A rhymes of verse four, but in reverse order (\u201cmother/brother\u201d becomes \u201cbrother/mother\u201d) Hemans adheres stringently to her \u201cplot\u201d, the contrast between the two experiences. The stranger utters a generous blessing to his interlocutor. He asserts the determination to believe in his family\u2019s watchful love. And then, immediately, death becomes intractable: \u201cbut dark seas roll between.\u201d Hemans builds The Two Homes from some fundamental imaginative resources. Her family moved from Liverpool to Gwrych, near Abergele, north Wales, in 1800, and she considered herself to be Welsh by adoption. After her marriage in 1812 she lived and raised five children in Wales, and remained there after her subsequent divorce, although she moved back to Liverpool after her mother\u2019s death in 1827, and ended her days in Dublin. While she is attracted to themes of female attainment and self-sacrifice, family life, as here, has transcendent status in her poetry, and finding it is rarely straightforward. The Two Homes begins with an epigraph from Song (\u201cFond dreams of love by love repaid\u201d) by the abolitionist Norwich poet, Amelia Opie. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t been able to track down the text of Song. Another interesting comparison is suggested by Richard Rutherford Johnston in Chapter 3 of his thesis, Romanticism and Mortal Consciousness, where he suggests that The Two Homes is a response to Wordsworth\u2019s poem We Are Seven.",

        "body": "Booker-shortlisted author Jonathan Escoffery and Guardian Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll and are among those shortlisted for this year\u2019s Gordon Burn prize, which aims to champion the year\u2019s \u201cboldest and most innovative\u201d books. Novels, short stories, memoirs and history books appear on the list, with stories that range from the IRA\u2019s efforts to kill Margaret Thatcher to an Inuk girl growing up in the Arctic. The shortlist features seven titles for the first time \u2013 in previous years, there have been five or six finalists. \u201cSeven books on the shortlist? Yes, yes, we were greedy this year,\u201d said judging chair and journalist Terri White. \u201cBut after hours of discussion and debate, it was clear we\u2019d need to take through all seven brilliant, blazing, eclectic books to fully represent the prize, and the legacy of Gordon\u2019s writing, today.\u201d Founded in 2012, the prize celebrates books that push boundaries, cross genres or otherwise challenge readers\u2019 expectations in honour of the writer Gordon Burn, who died of cancer in 2009. Carroll was shortlisted for Killing Thatcher, an account of the 1984 Brighton bombing, while Escoffery was nominated for his Booker-shortlisted If I Survive You, a collection of eight linked short stories about a Jamaican family in Miami navigating a recession and racism. Megan Nolan also made this year\u2019s shortlist for her second novel Ordinary Human Failings, about a family implicated in a crime, which is also shortlisted for the inaugural Nero book awards. White said that the judges often found themselves \u201cstruggling for the word to define\u201d the shortlisted books \u2013 \u201cnovel, memoir, true crime, biography, all shown up as wildly insufficient for books that wrangled, blended, mashed, incinerated and reinvented. That made us ask, what the bloody hell are we reading.\u201d Also on the shortlist was Wifedom: Mrs Orwell\u2019s Invisible Life by Anna Funder, about the life of Eileen O\u2019Shaughnessy; O Brother by John Niven, a memoir about his brother\u2019s suicide; Kick the Latch by Kathryn Scanlan, based on interviews with a horse trainer in the American midwest; and Split Tooth by Tanya Tagaq, a novel about an Inuk girl growing up in Nunavut, Canada, in the 1970s. Prize judge and author Sheena Patel said that the books \u201creflect Gordon Burn\u2019s ethos of form-pushing, well-told stories with strong writing at their core.\u201d The winner will be announced on 7 March at an event in Burn\u2019s home city of Newcastle. They will receive \u00a310,000 and the opportunity to undertake a writing retreat at Burn\u2019s cottage in Berwickshire. \u201cWe\u2019ve ended up with a shortlist of books which, as a writer, make you want to raise your game,\u201d said prize judge and journalist Andrew Hankinson. \u201cThey provide a broad range of stories, as well as of voices and approaches to writing. Every book on there is exceptional.\u201d Joining White, Hankinson and Patel on the judging panel is the author Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff. Previous winners of the prize include Benjamin Myers, Peter Pomerantsev and Hanif Abdurraqib. Last year, Preti Taneja won for her examination of the 2019 London Bridge terror attack, Aftermath. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 January 2024. The headline of an earlier version referred to an \u201celectric\u201d shortlist, when the actual quote was \u201ceclectic\u201d. It also incorrectly said that Gordon Burn was Scottish.

        "body": "When author Emily Perkins decided her next novel would be set in the New Zealand capital, her editors in the UK were pleased. The 53-year-old says this specific detail \u201cseemed to spark interest rather than resistance\u201d. The book, Lioness, tells the story of a self-styled, luxury guru who faces midlife reckoning amid whispers of fraud, and a new friendship with her charismatic neighbour. \u201cThere was absolute openness about something that was set in Wellington,\u201d she says. Perkins\u2019 experience marks a growing interest in New Zealand fiction from readers around the word. It comes 10 years after one the country\u2019s most acclaimed writers, Eleanor Catton, became the youngest winner of the Booker prize for her novel The Luminaries. Academics and publishers say New Zealand writers are booming overseas, yet some authors hold concerns for the future of the industry and funding for the creative sector after the centre-right coalition government took power in October 2023. Last year saw a string of globally successful releases from emerging and established New Zealand authors, including Catherine Chidgey, Anna Smaill and Perkins. #BookTok star Chloe Gong shot to the New York Times bestseller list with her new fantasy novella. Catton\u2019s latest book, Birnam Wood, secured spots on bestseller lists in the US and the UK. The novel was shortlisted for several UK awards. Chidgey and Catton have also been nominated for the 2024 Dublin literary prize. Breaking into new markets Tina Makereti, author and senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington says there is a \u201cboom of New Zealand writers being published overseas\u201d, including the US, UK and Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to break into those markets, and I think that\u2019s changed,\u201d Makereti says, citing the recent success of writers such as Tayi Tibble \u2013 who last year became the first M\u0101ori poet published in The New Yorker \u2013 and Perkins. The sentiment is echoed by Noel Murphy, commercial director at Granta Publications, which publishes Catton. He says New Zealand authors are making inroads in countries around the world. \u201cAll of a sudden, there are a bunch of New Zealand writers on their way into the European market in a way that probably hasn\u2019t been the case before,\u201d Murphy says. Makereti says international publishers are choosing writing that is \u201cvery New Zealand\u201d. She says after Covid, borders have become less limiting, and the star power of former prime minister Jacinda Ardern has also helped. \u201cNew Zealand is readily identifiable because of Jacinda,\u201d she says. \u2018Living on the fringes\u2019 While the success is growing, writers are split on the appeal of the work coming out of New Zealand \u2013 or whether there\u2019s a commonality at all. Murphy says over the last few years, reader appetite has shifted \u201caway from middle-class people worrying about getting divorced\u201d and towards \u201cdark, slightly unusual stories on the edge, which border on horror\u201d. Chidgey says New Zealand authors \u201cseem to write from the point of view of the outsider, from someone living on the fringes\u201d. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s maybe geographical \u2013 we do live on the fringes of the world.\u201d Wellington-based Smaill released her third novel Bird Life last year. The author, who was longlisted for the Booker prize in 2015, says there\u2019s \u201ca kind of a privilege to the isolation\u201d. \u201cWhen there are fewer people, it forces a kind of independence of mind where you don\u2019t inherit easy answers to things,\u201d Smaill says. \u201cI do think the \u2018Kiwi ingenuity\u2019 is a thing. There\u2019s a self-reliance that is a creative mode to fall back on,\u201d she says. Perkins stresses that just as there is no all-encapsulating style of New Zealand fiction, nor is there one clear reason for its recent popularity. \u201cThe more there is, the more variety you see \u2013 and the more pointless it becomes to try to define it in any one way,\u201d says the writer, who was longlisted for the Women\u2019s prize for fiction. \u201cIt could be a big thing like Jacinda or it could be a more conceptual thing like the colonial reckoning, or it could be down to a few people.\u201d Funding fears Despite the recent success, some hold concern over future support for creative industries in New Zealand, with arts groups saying the sector is starved of adequate funding. There is little to suggest the new National-led government will prioritise support for the sector. The National party did not have an arts policy in the lead-up to the 2023 election, nor were arts and culture mentioned in its coalition deals with minor parties Act and New Zealand First. Speaking to broadcaster RNZ in December, the new minister for arts, culture and heritage, Paul Goldsmith, said funding for the creative sector would be squeezed in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m taking stock of where we\u2019re at, we\u2019re obviously arriving at a time when there\u2019s not large amounts of money sloshing around, or free money, or extra money to come \u2013 so it\u2019s going to be tight.\u201d Creative New Zealand \u2013 the national arts development agency that funds artist projects \u2013 receives a baseline sum of just over NZ$16m a year from the government, which has barely shifted since 2006. The agency gets another 70% of its funding via the New Zealand Lottery Grants Board, which is now under threat due to proposed changes in the way the board allocates money. Creative NZ has warned it is operating at $5m less, going into 2024, than the previous year. Despite international praise and sales of New Zealand authors, the funding that helped give rise rise to its current vanguard has been eroded. Smaill says the government led by Helen Clark, in the early 2000s, was supportive of writers. \u201cFor me, and for many other writers I know, a far more significant and measurable impact was the support provided by the Clark government,\u201d Smaill says. The author says a funding scheme for creatives, dubbed the artists\u2019 dole, was a \u201chuge enabler of my writing career\u201d. \u201cIt gave me the freedom to focus on writing for a year following my master\u2019s and was pivotal in getting my first book published. That kind of funding is such a shot in the arm for new writers, and I\u2019d love to see a return to it.\u201d",

        "body": "No, you haven\u2019t wandered into a high summer column in error. Facial tanning drops are a peerlessly useful year-round beauty staple for a long list of reasons \u2013 and mimicking a fortnight in Tuscany is the least of them. If you have darker spots, melasma, rosacea, blotchiness, mild birthmarks or scarring that you\u2019re not happy about, please, regardless of your skin tone, dispense with preconceptions about fake tan and make friends with facial tanning drops. During a recent meeting with the brilliant consultant dermatologist Emma Craythorne, I showed her some old photographs of my once-extreme melasma (large brown patches often triggered by hormonal changes), before and after I\u2019d applied self-tan on the surrounding areas only (covering the dark patches with lighter concealer just turns them grey; levelling up the paler areas works miles better). She was so impressed by the dramatic effects of such a simple, fast and somewhat half-arsed method that she now recommends it to her patients. Shortly afterwards, I had a similar conversation with the esteemed beauty editor Eve Cameron, who told me she\u2019d managed the appearance of the once-problematic acne she\u2019d suffered in her youth by bronzing her face artificially, thus neutralising the angry-looking redness and evening out her overall skin tone. I then gave a girlfriend some St Tropez Luxe Tan Tonic Glow Drops (\u00a324) to apply over her menopause-triggered rosacea while her doctor-prescribed skincare got to work, and their effects have helped lift the dip in her confidence. Likewise, if you\u2019re a person with an illness that has dulled your skin and robbed you of the time or inclination to wear makeup, facial self-tan is a low-effort way to restore a healthier-looking glow to skin of any colour. Tan Luxe Super Glow (\u00a323.35), Beauty Pie Awesome Bronze (\u00a312.50 to members) and M&amp;S Autograph Self Tan Luxe Facial Oil (\u00a39.50) are similarly great and effective. Albeit cosmetically and temporarily, of course. Self-tan does nothing to fix underlying skin issues \u2013 the joy is in the speed and exceptional ease of application: just add a few drops to your usual moisturiser and mix, or apply the drops alone like a serum (if you have highlights, wear a headband for either, to avoid staining) you will enjoy a good two to three days of not having to think so much about concealing and covering areas that would otherwise stand out and cause stress.",

        "body": "Jane Austen\u2019s slim oeuvre has an odd place in the literary and filmic canon: readers tend to fall passionately in love with it when they are too young to understand how barbed and ambivalent its worldview is beneath the sprigged muslin. So it is both fun and appropriate to see her early novel given a fanfic makeover by Zoe Cooper of the sort that has previously seen Harry Potter copping off with Ron Weasley. Janeites, be warned. The first act of this three-hander is a delight, tracking the progress of the breathy young northerner Cath, from her birth in a hard-pressed household, overburdened with babies, to the dizzy social whirl of Bath, where she is whisked by childless friends of the family, with only her intimate knowledge of gothic literature to guide her through the baffling social hierarchies. There she meets the free-spirited and charismatic Iz and Hen, handsome heir to a leaky and undoubtedly haunted castle. The physical storytelling of Tessa Walker\u2019s production is clear and hilarious, building a world from a few pieces of furniture. A pile of old trunks serves as the coach and horses with which Iz\u2019s boneheaded brother nearly gallops Cath to her death, and a dressing-up box, from which emerge scraps of character, including a regimental jacket that is tossed between Cath, Hen and Iz to populate ballrooms and streets with predatory men. The problems emerge in the second act, where a tricksy chronology becomes too clever by half, so you are never quite sure if you are in Austen\u2019s head or Cooper\u2019s. Given that Isabella Thorpe is one of the novel\u2019s great disappointments, who disappears off to richer pastures halfway through it, the romance between Iz and Cath cannot resolve, with the result that the story sputters out like a damp candle on a staircase to nowhere. But there is no faulting the cast. Rebecca Banatvala creates a Cath who fizzes with bright-eyed, charismatic ardour; AK Golding\u2019s Iz has a truly Austenite satirical edge, which makes a mockery of her harrumphing men, even as she conjures them bodily out of thin air; Sam Newton\u2019s honest-to-goodness Hen holds the important line between dignity and send-up from his first appearance as Cath\u2019s labouring mum, giving birth to a large bolster cushion on a mothy chaise longue. It\u2019s a shame the play doesn\u2019t quite manage to gather these dazzling parts into a fully satisfying whole. \u2022 At the Orange Tree theatre, London, until 24 February. Then at Octagon theatre, Bolton, 1-23 March; Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, 27 March-13 April; and Theatre By the Lake, Keswick, 27 April-17 May. Available on demand, 21-24 May.",

        "body": "Tributes have been paid to a dancer from Lancashire who moved to the US and died after eating a biscuit that contained peanuts. \u00d3rla Baxendale, 25, had a peanut allergy. She died on 11 January after going into anaphylactic shock caused by the mislabelled vanilla florentine cookie she ate. Baxendale, originally from east Lancashire, had moved to New York to pursue her career as a professional dancer. Her sister, the actor Ciara Baxendale, known for playing Izzy in E4\u2019s My Mad Fat Diary, paid tribute on Instagram, describing \u00d3rla as radiant and a dreamer who was cherished by everyone. \u201cI will never ever, as long as I am on this earth, stop talking about how radiant, how beautiful, how kind, how cool, how hilarious, how witty, how vibrant she was. \u201cShe had a golden touch. Everything about her was magical, she was just so otherworldly. She looks just like an angel, and I just cannot believe that she has gone.\u201d In a statement, her family said: \u201c\u00d3rla was truly one of a kind. She was a beautiful, radiant, brave soul who always believed she would achieve her biggest dreams \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what she did. She danced her way across the world and lived life to the fullest every day. \u201cWe will never recover from the pain of having her taken from us so soon, in the prime of her life. But we are also so proud to call her our daughter and sister, and to have had the privilege of sharing 25 years with such an incredibly special person.\u201d Elmhurst ballet school in Birmingham, from where Baxendale graduated in 2018, described her as a \u201cradiant force\u201d on and off the dance floor. \u201cHer authenticity and ability to stay true to herself resonated with all who had the privilege of knowing her, and she had a remarkable gift for lighting up any room she entered,\u201d the school said. Baxendale trained and competed in Irish dancing from an early age before training at the Northern Ballet Academy and Elmhirst. She was cast in the world premiere production of Matthew Bourne\u2019s Romeo and Juliet and last June joined MOMIX Dance Company. The biscuit was bought from a branch of Stew Leonard\u2019s in Connecticut. Baxendale\u2019s lawyers in the US have said the death was preventable. In a statement, they said \u00d3rla\u2019s family had been \u201coverwhelmed and comforted by the outpouring of love, support, and tributes from around the world. \u201c\u00d3rla\u2019s vibrant spirit and her relentless pursuit of excellence in her art have left an indelible mark on all who knew her.\u201d They said Baxendale had been \u201ccareful and hyper-vigilant\u201d about everything she ate and always carried an Epi-Pen. The cookies were produced by the Long Island-based wholesaler Cookies United and labelled with the Stew Leonard\u2019s brand name, according to state officials. Stew Leonard Jr, the retailer\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a video post that the supplier had changed soy nuts to peanuts in the recipe without notifying their chief safety officer. Cookies United said it had notified Stew Leonard\u2019s last July that the product contained peanuts and that all products shipped to the retailer had been labelled accordingly. Cookies United said the incorrect label was created by Stew Leonard\u2019s. Stew Leonard\u2019s has recalled all the mislabelled biscuits in partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration.",

        "body": "One of the reasons I\u2019m not in favour of dry January is that it teaches you nothing about moderation. The temptation is to go back to what you were previously drinking with a huge sigh of relief, in much the same way as you hit the Easter eggs after giving up chocolate for Lent. There is another way forward, though, and that is to buy wines that are lower in alcohol; after the recent increase in duty on wines with a higher ABV, there are a now growing number of them, too. An 11% wine, for example, attracts \u00a32.35 duty, compared with \u00a32.67 for most still wines; reduce that to 8%, meanwhile, and you have to pay only \u00a31.49. But is that likely to satisfy you? Apart from riesling (even that is higher in alcohol than it once was) and Portugal\u2019s vinho verde, few wines are naturally low in alcohol, and those that are generally tend to be sweet. Interestingly, one company that has cottoned on to the trend for lower-ABV wines is Laithwaites, which, according to wine director Nick Taylor, recently worked out that just under a tenth of all the bottles it sold in the past six months were 11% ABV or under. Not all its customers seem to be convinced, however: the Portuguese red in today\u2019s pick below seems to be a bit of a Marmite wine, with ratings ranging from one to four stars, with one customer proclaiming it \u201cdelightful\u201d and another \u201can appalling excuse for a red wine\u201d. I found it quite appealing when I opened it, but it was not as good the next day, plus I can\u2019t help but feel that if the duty is lower, the price should be, too. More widely popular is Laithwaites\u2019 bright, zesty Gooseberry Bush Colombard Sauvignon Blanc 2023 (\u00a39.99, or \u00a38.99 by the case, 10.5%), from South Africa, which is now the retailer\u2019s best-selling white. A better way forward might be drinking a wine you actually like, but doing so from a smaller glass and moderating the alcohol that way instead. A 125ml glass of a 12% wine (which comes about halfway up an average-sized wine glass) is 1.3 units, whereas a 14.5% one is just over 1.8 units; similarly, a 175ml glass, which is more common in pubs, would be 2.1 for a 12% wine and 2.53 for a 14.5% wine. (You can work out how many units there are in any drink by multiplying the total volume in millilitres by its percentage ABV and dividing the result by 1,000.) At the end of the day, it\u2019s up to you, but if you like the sound of lower-alcohol wines, here are four that should tick that particular box. Five wines that are lower in alcohol Maria Fadista Vinho Verde \u00a310.99 (\u00a39.99 as part of a mixed case of 12) Laithwaites, 8.5%. Fresh, sharp, spritzy white \u2013 good for the ABV. Stones &amp; Bones Ligeiro 2021 \u00a310.99 (\u00a39.99 as part of a mixed case of 12) Laithwaites, 10.5%. Soft, ripe, jammy red that packs a bigger punch than its abv. Share it with friends, though, because it\u2019s not as good the next day. Wrong Turn Fern\u00e3o Pires 2023 \u00a38.99 Aldi (in store only), 11.5%. Light, aromatic, off-dry South African white that you\u2019ll enjoy if you\u2019re a riesling or gew\u00fcrztraminer fan. Low stocks, so snap it up if you spot it. The Doctors\u2019 Riesling 2022 \u00a311.99 (\u00a38.99 on mix-six) Majestic, 9%. The Doctors\u2019 range is really good \u2013 there\u2019s also a very decent sauvignon \u2013 and this is a vivid, limey, off-dry riesling with a whiff of kerosene. Would be good with a Thai meal. Eric Texier Chat Fou 2021 \u00a312.25 (sale price, down from \u00a317) Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 12.5%. Fresh, gluggable vin de soif from the Rh\u00f4ne \u2013 a style that\u2019s clearly not entirely to Berry Bros\u2019 customers\u2019 taste, given the size of the reduction. Good price for a natural wine, though. For more by Fiona Beckett, go to fionabeckett.substack.com",

        "body": "A short time after Georgia Blain died I discovered that I\u2019d somehow deleted her voice messages from my phone. It was another devastating loss: I mourned those random, ordinary messages about nothing \u2013 about running late for coffee, how to cook burghul \u2013 because I couldn\u2019t bear never to hear her voice again. Sometimes, when I miss her now, I listen to our conversation about her work recorded for a writers festival, or I find one of her many radio interviews still available online. I love to hear her speaking voice: clear, unsentimental, truthful, funny. Self-deprecating, yet completely unashamed. Those same qualities are found in her writer\u2019s voice \u2013 in her memoirs and essays and in her fiction, most especially her last, finest novel. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning In 2016 Georgia\u2019s friend, the writer James Bradley, wrote that her memoir Births Deaths Marriages \u201cunlocked something in Georgia\u2019s work, liberating her somehow, for after it her writing shifted registers, becoming simultaneously more personal and more expansive\u201d. I agree with James. I think her work grew in stature and clarity, and in the expansive confidence he notes \u2013 the confidence to hide nothing of herself, even in the works most full of invention. Her last works shine with authority and truth and courage. My grief for Georgia was also about the terrible unfairness of losing her work, just when her talent was approaching its height. How precious then, to have these \u201cnew\u201d stories, written between 2012 and 2015. Georgia had read them again around the time she was finalising Between a Wolf and a Dog, intending to offer them as a collection at an appropriate interval after the novel\u2019s publication. Then life changed suddenly and other things, other work took priority, particularly the writings that became the magnificent, posthumously published The Museum of Words: a memoir of language, writing and mortality. But the stories remained and now here they are. These stories once again enter the terrain of Georgia\u2019s familiar preoccupations. She had, by the time she died, let go of any youthful shame about being drawn back and back to the same ground. In an interview in 2016 she told me: I [used to be] embarrassed about it \u2013 there was that male sort of notion that you had to write completely outside yourself and you should be demonstrating a breadth of skill. But I\u2019m not that kind of writer. And I\u2019m not embarrassed any more, because many writers I love \u2013 like Alice Munro and Richard Ford, for example \u2013 write into the same material over and over. And what you write in your 20s is very different from how you interpret things when you\u2019re 50. You have quite a different angle on the same concerns. It was Flaubert who said fiction is \u201cthe response to a deep and always hidden wound\u201d. But there was nothing hidden about the great wound in Georgia\u2019s family \u2013 the loss of her brother to schizophrenia and drug addiction at a young age \u2013 and over time she came to accept this loss as a natural wellspring for her fiction. This collection is no exception. But in these stories we also see exploration of another lifelong preoccupation \u2013 Georgia\u2019s deep and complicated attachment to her mother and the new agony of watching her be consumed by Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But of course, writing fiction \u201cclose to home\u201d is not the same as writing memoir. Like all good art, Georgia\u2019s fiction takes the intimate experience of her own life and transforms it, and in doing so reveals new and surprising discoveries for all of us. We All Lived in Bondi Then has an elegiac quality, often meditating on the isolating aftermath of loss: the parents in the devastating Ship to Shore, unable to reach each other after the death of their child. The film-maker sister in Australia Square, trying to reclaim her own sidelined experience of a terrible childhood incident while her brother still suffers the consequences. Or the regretful Annie in Last Days, contemplating her lost self in motherhood. The stories are complex, sometimes morphing from one \u201csubject\u201d into quite another, like Dear Professor Brewster. A daughter\u2019s account of her mother\u2019s slowly blossoming Alzheimer\u2019s disease is also an account of her father\u2019s absence \u2013 she being the child of an affair, her mother the eternal other woman \u2013 and of the almost-siblings she could have had, the mixed-up family with their mixed-up resentments and loyalties. It\u2019s a beautifully bevelled story; each time you turn it, it shows itself in a different light. Youthful ambition\u2019s evaporation is another thread through these stories, often told from middle age, recalling the brutal clumsiness of youth. Twenty-something actors, writers, film-makers, musicians and dancers parade gorgeously through share-house parties in their op-shop finery, glittering with potential, drug-heightened recklessness, lust and destined fame. As one narrator says: \u201cMy hopes and desires and plans all unsullied, the self that I was to become beckoning, waiting.\u201d These artists in waiting reappear decades later in accidental meetings, now ruefully teaching drama in high school or managing music-licensing databases, chastened by the years and reality\u2019s bruises. It\u2019s testament to Georgia\u2019s clear-eyed vision that these transformations contain no lessons, no authorial judgments \u2013 simply her compassionate observation of the ways life has of turning out differently than we\u2019d hoped. Then, there are the dogs. Old dogs, disobedient dogs, abandoned dogs, mysterious telephone-answering dogs, dogs named Dotty and Pixie and Edna plod and skitter their way through these pages. Dying dogs, who carry meaning and knowledge we humans overlook or ignore, but who lead us to things we need to see. \u201cYou can\u2019t close their eyes when they die,\u201d says a child in Last One Standing and the narrator finds that it\u2019s true. Things are still to be seen, difficult things, following a death. In Australia Square, the narrator discovers her late mother\u2019s obsessive notes and diaries, documenting attempts to make sense of the event that changed the family for ever. The middle-aged narrator learns that she and her mother shared the same recurring dream of the calamity in one of these diaries. I\u2019d held it with trepidation, hoping I would find a clear, concise explanation for her relentless attempts to retrieve my brother\u2019s memory, perhaps some awareness of her own madness, maybe it was an apology I wanted, or a glimpse of softness and love, even regret that she had lost me. They were all there. And then I put the book away. It was just one slim volume amidst piles of notes and tapes, a few words that revealed another hidden, but not definitive, self. I had found something secret, but that did not mean I had found her. This ending shows us what Georgia always knew, what her writing has always told us: there are no easy answers. No clear conclusions will emerge to save us. Life will do with us what it will and our only task is to love one another as best we can. Like the bereaved couple lying mute in the dark, Georgia\u2019s clear, insightful voice tells us this is our only duty: to keep sending those whispered signals out and back, ship to shore, shore to lost ship. \u2022 This is an edited version of the foreword to We All Lived in Bondi Then by Georgia Blain (Scribe, $29.99)",

        "body": "Lashana Lynch is cocooned in a full-length padded coat and beanie, looking inconspicuous as a friend checks her into the well-known London members\u2019 club we have arranged to meet in, then leaves. Lynch sees me and grins, yet I can\u2019t help but picture the 36-year-old actor axe-kicking me in the face. That was more her speed with a history-making turn as M16 agent Nomi, the spy who takes over the 007 code number in Daniel Craig\u2019s 2021 swansong Bond film No Time to Die. Today, though, she\u2019s unassuming. So much so that no one besides the reception manager has recognised her. No big deal \u2013 except now there are no club members in our party and so we\u2019re flouting house rules. Lynch goes back and forth with a server after trying to order some peppermint tea without a membership card (\u201cUm, do you have a name?\u201d we\u2019re asked). Her friend calls to share the details we need. But you can\u2019t use a phone here, so she can\u2019t answer. Finally, after a manager is consulted and we agree to \u201csettle the tab straight away\u201d, the tea is on its way. That was awkward. \u201cThis feels like \u2026 Are we back in the 1960s?\u201d Lynch says, the subtext being that we are two young Black women feeling a little like intruders. \u201cIt just feels slightly oppressive. It\u2019s fine, though. I just won\u2019t do this again.\u201d Maybe Lynch just looks too regular outside the context (and costume) of her star-making action roles. She took on single-mother fighter pilot Maria Rambeau in Captain Marvel, her 2019 breakout. There was Bond, of course, culminating in Lynch\u2019s Bafta rising star win in early 2022. Then, months later, as barefoot warrior Izogie in Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s historical epic The Woman King, she swung her machete through pummelling fight-scene choreography with grit and fluidity (in an ensemble cast led by Viola Davis). She capped the year off as Miss Honey in Matilda the Musical, showing off her sweet singing voice, and briefly returned to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2023 for a shocking post-credits cameo in The Marvels. Next up, Lynch will play reggae matriarch and singer Rita Marley, Bob Marley\u2019s wife, in the forthcoming biopic Bob Marley: One Love. Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green with Kingsley Ben-Adir in the title role, the film focuses on a few years in the 1970s to tell the lesser-known stories of the man who became a legend in the decades after his death, aged 36, in 1981. It was shot in Jamaica, from which country Lynch\u2019s family originate. Lynch grew up in the London areas of Hammersmith and Shepherd\u2019s Bush, and has said that her class identity inspired her work ethic. She realised there were differences between her and some of her friends at primary school: they had au pairs (\u201cI didn\u2019t know what an au pair was!\u201d) and their families went on the sort of regular weekend excursions she thought were reserved for proper holidays. \u201cBack then, it was the size of friends\u2019 houses and the very casual way I might be told, \u2018Oh, you like that thing? Take it. You want a teddy? I can buy that for you.\u2019\u201d Lynch is magnetic to talk to: wide-eyed and husky-voiced. As an adult, her tendency to strive sometimes made her push herself too far. \u201cYou want to just keep going. I especially do, being from a working-class background. You want to just\u201d \u2013 she clicks her fingers \u2013 \u201cgo-go-go. You don\u2019t wanna miss out on anything, you don\u2019t wanna let anyone down.\u201d She is a grafter. Early on in her career, while appearing in Fast Girls, a 2012 film about rival track athletes, and a 2015 stage production of Educating Rita, she worked day jobs to pay her rent. While temping as an NHS receptionist, she was cast as Rosaline Capulet in Still Star-Crossed, executive-producer Shonda Rhimes\u2019s 2016 period drama about what happened next to the families of Romeo and Juliet. Without the safety net of a wealthy background, Lynch had to be strategic. \u201cI got the pilot. Shot the pilot. Came back home, still couldn\u2019t afford my rent or to pay off my credit card, was in the minus in my overdraft,\u201d she says. In the months-long gap between the pilot and shooting the rest of the series, \u201cI took my per diems from the show,\u201d as in the living-expenses allowance paid to cast and crew on location. \u201cI was shooting so much that I hadn\u2019t been able to spend them, and I brought them back to London, exchanged them into pounds, then bought groceries and things. Yeah, it was bad.\u201d She laughs drily. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta decide: am I buying eggs, or putting money on my Oyster card? And I had to make that decision many a time.\u201d This month, actor Peter Capaldi spoke out about the lack of opportunities for working-class actors these days, saying \u201cthere\u2019s less and less of my lot in the arts\u201d, and blaming \u201cgatekeepers\u201d who have left the industry full of \u201ctedious\u201d actors who \u201care not the real thing\u201d. The share of working-class actors, musicians and writers has halved since 1970, according to social mobility research from 2022. Meanwhile, a 2021 study found that actors from middle-class backgrounds were often found to self-identify as working class in order to build up a kind of mythology about their origins. But, for Lynch, growing up in a loving home that wasn\u2019t wealthy is no fiction. \u201cClass is always important to discuss, as the rise in an artist\u2019s career can make it appear as though they came from said level and just moved across \u2013 when that\u2019s absolutely not my experience. My working-class background has always kept me prepped with tools that have protected me in the industry,\u201d she says, tools such as resilience, drive and an ability to push forward after being told no. Until things change, says Lynch, \u201cin true working-class fashion, [rejection can] drive so much hunger that I\u2019ve seen projects from people that have come out of the many nos they were told. That sometimes sends out a louder message to the decision-makers.\u201d Lynch is the youngest of three children, and the only daughter. \u201cI want to say I naturally grew up as a tomboy, but, of course, with the influence of two older brothers, nurture had to have played its part,\u201d she says. \u201cI was outspoken in different ways, not so much in others. Being the younger sister, I felt protected. But I didn\u2019t feel like my brothers needed to protect me.\u201d Her mother worked in housing and her dad in social care. Lynch spent a lot of time with her maternal grandmother, too, and credits the strong women around her for shaping her personality. She tosses out casual assessments of self-belief as we chat \u2013 \u201cI deal with my stuff instantly\u201d or \u201cI know I can always find a solution to a problem very quickly\u201d. And so her early years seem a good place to start to figure out how she got this grounded. Would she barrel into the first day of school, or hang back? \u201cOh, it was anxiety-y-y. For the first day of anything,\u201d she chuckles. \u201cI always feel like I\u2019m at the first day of school when I enter new environments. I\u2019m like, \u2018This is what it felt like when I was four, at nursery, and they weren\u2019t listening to me.\u2019\u201d Lynch had eczema, and special provisions needed to be made to avoid flare-ups. \u201cLike soy milk instead of cow\u2019s milk, when soy milk wasn\u2019t so great in the 90s.\u201d This meant she had to describe the skin condition to sceptical adults. \u201cI learned how to use my voice to protect myself early on, though I wasn\u2019t the outspoken, confident person I am today. Definitely not.\u201d Her own Miss Honey, a supportive former deputy headteacher whom she still calls Miss Amable, reminded Lynch of how that has changed. \u201cI met up with her off the back of Matilda and she said, \u2018You really wanted to sing, and you really wanted to be on stage but you were so shy! And we had to access that through different ways.\u2019\u201d Amable brought Lynch out of her shell. On the Matilda set, Lynch had to be Amable-like herself. As fearsome headteacher Miss Trunchbull, Emma Thompson stomped around so convincingly that Lynch felt she needed to protect the child actors. \u201cThere were hundreds of children just watching Emma walk around with prosthetics and these teeth and these massive boots, and she was so unbelievably mean as this character,\u201d Lynch told the Wrap in 2022. She tells me her co-star was actually \u201cso warm and motherly towards the children after we cut. Working with so many children in one space, it\u2019s important that they know when we\u2019re playing dress up, so to speak, and when we\u2019re ourselves.\u201d When I ask her whether the big-name actors she has co-starred with, from Daniel Craig to Viola Davis, have taught her anything, she says: \u201cThey have always given me the space to learn and just be in my own way. If there\u2019s anything I have learned from them, it\u2019s that no matter how experienced you are, you\u2019re always having a first-time experience. The first-day-of-school vibes are real for everybody.\u201d She says she was encouraged to hear that they suffered from nerves. \u201cMany of them aren\u2019t too shy to tell you their fears, or the fact that they don\u2019t know something.\u201d Lynch\u2019s family was happy for her to explore singing and acting when she was a child without necessarily lining up a plan-B career. She attended Sylvia Young theatre school at weekends and later the Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick. She noticed then that being of Jamaican descent shaped her sense of home in particular ways. \u201cA lovely, plush kitchen with a Dutch pot in it,\u201d she says chuckling, or a bowl filled with plantain on the counter at all times. And, of course, Bob Marley\u2019s music was present; his global success personally significant. Lynch\u2019s earliest memories of the Marleys are of her doing chores while listening to Bob Marley and the Wailers on full blast. \u201cWhich is why I like cleaning now. Literally,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cCleaning is not a chore to me. Because on the weekends, playing their music \u2013 along with many other reggae legends, of course \u2013 was a spiritual experience.\u201d How does it feel to have taken on Rita Marley, such a well-known public figure from Jamaica? Daunting? \u201cMad, mad, mad, mad. So mad. And I\u2019ll probably say that for ever.\u201d A pause. \u201cA lot of people ask you, \u2018Are there any roles you\u2019d love to play? What\u2019s your dream role? What\u2019s your dream genre?\u2019 And there are certain things I don\u2019t think about, that I don\u2019t consider.\u201d One of which was the Marley family. \u201cI never imagined, ever, ever, ever imagined, playing Rita. I just \u2026 as you can tell, I\u2019m still trying to put my finger on how I feel, beyond honoured and grateful.\u201d Rita and two of her children with Bob, Cedella and Ziggy, and Ziggy\u2019s wife, Orly, are among the film\u2019s producers. As soon as Lynch got the part, she says: \u201cMy first question was: where is Rita and when can I fly to her? I had to make that happen.\u201d Rita welcomed Lynch into her home, twice, joined at points by Cedella, and Rita\u2019s daughter Sharon (Bob was her adoptive father), who brokered the meeting. \u201cAnd when I came in, it was like \u2013 I don\u2019t know, this is very dramatic but \u2013 a version of heaven,\u201d she laughs, \u201cwhere there\u2019s a god-like, queen-like ethereal figure sitting way in the distance, with their back to you.\u201d Lynch put down her things, and went to freshen up before going to greet Rita, \u201cand Sharon said, \u2018Mum said she can already see that you have the energy. She\u2019s so glad that you\u2019re here.\u2019\u201d Lynch puts her hand to her throat, and recreates her stage-whispered, wide-eyed \u201cThank you\u201d in response. They ate home-cooked meals and talked for hours. \u201cWe laughed about young love and reminisced about memories that seemed to be incredibly vivid and visceral,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cThere are obviously a lot of interviews with her. There\u2019s her book, which I\u2019ve read, but there\u2019s nothing like feeling the connection with her.\u201d Lynch wasn\u2019t so much sitting down and taking notes on, say, the way Rita speaks or sits; she was looking for something a bit looser on which to build her interpretation. In the film, the Marley matriarch is the backbone of the story, Lynch tells me. \u201cAgainst all odds, she was able to withstand while remaining graceful. Not an easy thing to do.\u201d Later, when shooting, Lynch used their time together to dig into her character; Ziggy and Cedella were also on hand to give her and the cast on-set advice. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that they were by our sides to answer all our questions. Things like, \u2018What should her bangle look like?\u2019 and, \u2018Is the head-wrap OK?\u2019 All of those things. But also whenever I questioned myself, I just tapped into Rita\u2019s energy that I\u2019d been able to sit with for hours at a time. Sometimes I don\u2019t even know if I made the right decision, but I know that it felt like the right decision.\u201d A couple of weeks after wrapping One Love in early 2023, Lynch shaved her head. It felt like a positive way to shed the role, for which she had worn a wig. A head shave is one thing, but what else does she do to decompress after a tough gig? \u201cUsually I don\u2019t speak to anybody,\u201d she says, deadpan. \u201cUsually I just go quiet. Not \u2018phone off\u2019, but less phone time, and I give myself as much time as I think I need. When the stuff is out, and I can just sit in myself again.\u201d Mostly, she\u2019s just learning to give herself a break between jobs. \u201cIn my 20s, I didn\u2019t believe I needed much time \u2013 maybe a few days? And now I\u2019m like, \u2018I need six months,\u2019\u201d she says, pursing her lips. \u201cGive me six months, and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d It sounds as if she toggles between extremes: intense work, then powering down rather than blowing off steam. To get to this point, she had to figure out how to fight her own corner. Lynch remembers a ballet teacher who thought she had bad posture because of the curve of her back into her bum. \u201cI was so aware of my Blackness, or my melanated-ness, because of how different my body was. Which a lot of older Caucasian women wouldn\u2019t consider when just telling you to \u2018stand up straight\u2019. And I mean, look, I have very great posture,\u201d she smiles, adjusting in her chair. Her teacher wasn\u2019t impressed, and Lynch didn\u2019t challenge her. \u201cThat was one example of me not learning early on how to utilise me, instead of being used. I was used, in that moment, because this white teacher didn\u2019t understand, and took it out on me.\u201d Lynch quit ballet not long after, when she was about seven, moving to track and field and netball. Being an active child and teen primed Lynch for physically taxing roles. She did her own stunts in The Woman King. She flings her arms out while telling me about the move that most challenged her. \u201cI had to run in a line \u2013 like, what\u2019s the event? A long jumper or a high jumper, I guess \u2013 then jump on a man\u2019s back like a bear, roll on my back with him still intact, land on my feet and then land with a strong pose at the end.\u201d She pulls her arms into an angular X. \u201cAnd I laughed my freaking head off. How \u2026 do you think it\u2019s possible for me to jump, like a bear, on a man? And stay there!\u201d But she did \u2013 and it made the opening scene of the film. \u201cIt\u2019s actually mad. I\u2019m reliving it now as I\u2019m speaking to you,\u201d and she chuckles to herself. \u201cI mean, Gina [the director] is one of the most wonderful humans on this Earth, but I still won\u2019t really forgive her for asking me to do that.\u201d A proper cackle now. Undergoing ninja training for No Time to Die, doing live stunts in The Woman King \u2013 they all initially sounded impossible. Lynch says directors seem to see her and think, \u201cGo on \u2013 I bet you can do this.\u201d When she was asked to skid along a balcony floor on her shoulder while being shot at, in No Time to Die, \u201cmy life flashed before my eyes. So it\u2019s not a challenge in that I don\u2019t believe I can do it. It was more, \u2018How do you trust me to do it? It did not make any sense to me, it did not compute in any way. Until I did it. And I thought, \u2018Wow, that was actually a much easier barrier to break than I\u2019d anticipated.\u2019 Really easy.\u201d Looking back on the girl she was, Lynch realises she dragged herself towards this confidence rather than seeing her introversion as an asset. \u201cI\u2019d taken it as: fight through the shyness, fight through the anxiety, so I can get to the point where I\u2019m confident.\u201d She was told by the No Time to Die stunt team that she was the only person who didn\u2019t get injured during training and filming. Her tendency to fight through both physical strain and niggling self-doubt seems to have paid off. \u201cI utilise so much from my childhood now, because it\u2019s literally in my bones to move in an athletic way,\u201d she says, before returning to ballet. \u201cAlso, thank God for that teacher. She\u2019s there probably doing the same thing, and I\u2019m out here like, \u2018Cheers for that.\u2019\u201d She raises her cup, an imaginary clink made. She smiles, pausing for a beat. \u201cCos now I get to kick people in the face on screen.\u201d \u2022 Bob Marley: One Love is released in the UK on 14 February",

        "body": "The Academy award nominations on Tuesday contained, among the plethora of announcements, intriguing evidence of the strength of familial connections underpinning major Oscar bids, with a number of the 10 films nominated for best picture containing both members of high profile relationships, working together on the same film. Barbie, the doll-inspired blockbuster that, to the chagrin of many including Ryan Gosling, appeared to be snubbed in the best actress and best director categories, even contains two of them. Star Margot Robbie and husband Tom Ackerley are co-founders of LuckyChap Entertainment, the company that produced the film, while director Greta Gerwig is up for best adapted screenplay alongside her husband Noah Baumbach. The 2024 Oscar crop appears to have been particularly favourable to these kind of partnerships: the director-producer team behind best picture nominee Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, are also married, while Anatomy of a Fall director Justine Triet is up for a best original screenplay Oscar along with Arthur Hariri, with whom she is in a long-term relationship and has two children. Elsewhere on the list is May December writer Samy Burch, who shares a \u201cstory by\u201d credit with husband Alex Mechanik, and Napoleon Dynamite director Jared Hess, who has co-directed and co-written best animated short film nominee Ninety Five Senses with wife Jerusha. All these are film industry veterans, working together (and not) on multiple projects over the years; it is no doubt a coincidence, albeit a noticeable one, that so many find themselves up for Oscars together. Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls on Film podcast, says she has a positive view of the phenomenon. \u201cI think these are examples of real life partners working very well together with a shared vision, or at least visions that complement each other. Baumbach and Ackerley strike me as feminist allies and Baumbach doubtless brought a helpful and witty male perspective to the Barbie script, which he and Gerwig wrote living together in lockdown \u2013 handy!\u201d It is a form of creative collaboration that is by no means new: back in 1919, Mary Pickford, then one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars, co-founded the studio United Artists with her future husband Douglas Fairbanks (as well as Charlie Chaplin and Birth of a Nation director DW Griffith). Thomas and Nolan met while both were students at University College London, and have worked together since their first short film, the Nolan-directed Doodlebug. Robbie set LuckyChap up with Ackerley in 2014 along with friends Sophia Kerr and Josey McNamara, while Gerwig and Baumbach met while making Baumbach\u2019s 2010 film Greenberg. It is self-evident, though, that the highly pressured environment of film production can pose special difficulties for collaborators also in a relationship. Rebecca Harrell Tickell and Josh Tickell, who have made a string of award-winning environmental documentaries including The Big Fix, Kiss the Ground and its followup Common Ground, say that the all-consuming demands of film-making are hard to manage. Harrell Tickell says: \u201cOur marriage and family are so enmeshed with our films and mission we can sometimes take the successes and failures a little too personally.\u201d Tickell adds: \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a great source of strength. The pitfall is that there is no division between work, family life and love life.\u201d While the risks of making films together are clear, it\u2019s evident that, in this Oscar round at least, we can see the positives. Nolan and Thomas have been making films together since their first short film, while Robbie and Ackerley have capitalised on the former\u2019s acting career to branch out and back the careers of directors such as Emerald Fennell and Megan Park. Despite their distinct authorial voices as high-profile directors, Gerwig and Baumbach collaborated on a script for Barbie that, beforehand, it would have seemed unlikely that either would have produced solo. The problem of how to resolve creative disagreements \u2013 without it destroying personal relationships \u2013 is a definite issue. Harrell Tickell says: \u201cMostly we are aligned, or one of us can be flexible. But if we strongly disagree we usually have to take a moment and hash out our opposing views away from our staff. When we resolve conflicts related to our films, we each get a vote and what the film needs gets a vote.\u201d Tickell suggests this can be a source of strength: \u201cMiscommunications are inevitable and there are of course moments when we don\u2019t see eye to eye. But often the \u2018third path\u2019, something neither of us saw, opens up and that new pathway is where the creative genius lies.\u201d In the end, though, the positives outweigh the negatives, says Harrell Tickell. \u201cEmbracing our partnership makes us exponentially more effective than either of us as an individual.\u201d",

        "body": "Prof Mark Maslin studies climate change and human impacts as professor of Earth system science at University College London (UCL) and the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. He recently partnered with the comedian Jo Brand in an online film to \u201ctranslate\u201d climate science for a wider audience. He is one of the lead organisers of Love Your Planet with Al Gore\u2019s charity, the Climate Reality Project, and the Climate Cafe at UCL on 14 February. We\u2019ve just heard officially that 2023 was the world\u2019s hottest year, and that we are likely to breach the temperature rise limit of 1.5C warming above pre-industrial levels in the next 12 months. What are your thoughts on that? Last year being the hottest on record was something we knew was going to happen at the end of 2023. Two hundred of the 365 days last year were the hottest ever recorded for that particular day, which gives some idea of how huge this was. The temperature is 1.48C above the pre-industrial \u2013 close to the 1.5C limit [for this century] that was set up by the Paris agreement in 2016 \u2013 so we are worryingly close to it. We also know that El Ni\u00f1o [a natural weather pattern] is starting in the Pacific Ocean and always adds some warming. So in 2024, we could break the 1.5C limit temporarily. Last year we saw many extreme weather events: heatwaves, wildfires and floods \u2013 can we expect more of the same in 2024? In 2023, there were over 220 extreme climate events. There was a 30% increase in fatalities caused by climate events on the previous year. We saw massive heatwaves in North America, southern Europe, China and Asia. We also saw wildfires. And lots of underreported events. For example, east Africa had huge long droughts and catastrophic flooding. There was no continent that was not affected by extreme weather events \u2013 and our ability to cope with them is getting less. A lot of people have said to me: \u201cOh it was a rubbish summer in the UK.\u201d We had the hottest July on record. We had a slightly warmer than average August, and it was the second hottest year ever recorded in the UK. But because people are now expecting southern England to be like the French Riviera, if we don\u2019t have 30C weather in August they go: \u201cOoh it\u2019s not a good summer.\u201d No. We shouldn\u2019t be having summers like that. Ever. Two years ago we had a 40C heatwave in London, which had us climatologists with our jaws on the ground. We were predicting [40C] for the 2040s\u2026 The expectation of many climatologists, including myself, is that 2024 could be hotter than 2023, and with more extreme weather events as El Ni\u00f1o really takes hold. You\u2019re a professor of Earth system science at UCL \u2013 tell me about your main research? I study climate change in the past, present and future. My research is incredibly wide ranging: I study early human evolution in east Africa, the evolution of the Anthropocene and how human impact has changed through history, and the impacts of climate change on society now and in the future. I also look at resource crises in the future. You and your colleagues released a study on private jet flights and the carbon footprint estimates of travel to the Cop climate meetings just before Cop28 in Dubai last month. What were your findings? We looked at all private jet flights to Cop26 and 27. We are working on Cop28 now and will be releasing that at the end of this year. What we\u2019re not trying to say is world leaders have to go on commercial jets \u2013 because we want them to turn up to Cop meetings \u2013 but what we are saying is maybe all 100,000 people at Cop28 didn\u2019t need to be there. Please don\u2019t get me wrong: Cops are really important. This is a place where 198 countries come together as equals. So when you have a statement that says we are going to transition away from fossil fuels \u2013 which is signed by everybody \u2013 it has real weight. You recently featured in a short online film for Climate Science Breakthrough with comedian Jo Brand \u2013 who translated your words to get the message across. For example, her interpretation of governments giving subsidies to fossil fuel companies was: \u201cEven the dinosaurs didn\u2019t subsidise their own extinctions; who\u2019s the stupid species now?\u201d Jo Brand is an amazing person. We have very similar views and backgrounds. She worked for the NHS; most of my family work in the NHS\u2026 We have similar political views. When my mother was alive she loved telling the story of when she was pregnant with me and she had to drag the coal home because they couldn\u2019t afford to have it delivered. That tells you, one: that we were poor. And two: we had a coal fire, not central heating. So growing up in that sort of austerity means that Jo and I have a connection. There\u2019s one point in the film where we\u2019d been chatting about how we could make Britain better and Jo turned and said: \u201cOh Mark, I really think you should be prime minister.\u201d And I said: \u201cJo, do I really want that job?\u201d And she went: \u201cYeah, maybe not.\u201d I said: \u201cHow about we do it together?\u201d And she said: \u201cOh that\u2019s a good idea!\u201d And it was that comedy gold, that lovely rapport, which I think comes over. Might you be looking at a career in comedy? No, I\u2019m very happy to be the straight man! This communication of climate change, human impact on the world etc is incredibly depressing and can make people feel powerless. So there is always a little bit of humour running through everything I do. Also I try to talk about positives. Because in climate change there are so many solutions: things that we should be doing anyway. So renewable energy, guess what? We get much cleaner air, which means that we have less loss of life due to things like asthma and chest infections. Yes, tick, tick, tick. We have energy security because it\u2019s our own energy so we don\u2019t have all these incredible price rises. Fossil fuels are 19th- and 20th-century technologies. We have incredible technology now. Therefore, why don\u2019t we move into the 21st century and make things better? Is there room for climate optimism then? We have all the technology we need to move to a cleaner, renewable world. All the stats are showing incredible growth: we have exponential growth in solar, wind, EV batteries, which is all fantastic. We also have politics \u2013 90% of the world\u2019s economy says it will be net zero some time this century. That\u2019s huge. We are transitioning away from fossil fuels. It should have been 30 years ago, but it\u2019s now. The signalling is great, but we have to do it faster. You\u2019re organising a \u201cLove Your Planet\u201d event at UCL next month. What does it involve? The Climate Reality Project has got together with UCL to produce a day of panels, talks and networking on the green transition. How do we get business, politicians, academics and activists all working together to make this happen quicker? We also have hopefully a few positive words from Al Gore himself, in a short video introduction. It\u2019s on Valentine\u2019s Day. If you have a loved one and you\u2019ve forgotten, I will be reminding you that you should at least text \u2013 even without Jo Brand, I\u2019m using humour to try to engage people, and to think about their relationship with their loved ones, but also with their planet, which is their home. And it\u2019s the only one we have. Just like we nurture our relationships with other people, we really should be nurturing our relationship with our own planet. Love Your Planet is at Logan Hall, London WC1 on 14 Feb, 10am-6pm \u2022 This article was amended on 30 January 2024 to clarify that Mark Maslin is one of the lead organisers of Love Your Planet, rather than \u201cthe lead organiser\u201d as an earlier version said.",

        "body": "A man training for the London Marathon while carrying a fridge on his back has told of how he was stopped by police who thought he had stolen the appliance. Daniel Fairbrother was brought to a halt by officers in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, during training for his attempt to break the world record for the \u201cfastest marathon carrying a household appliance (white goods)\u201d. He told the BBC that the officers quickly realised he was not stealing anything and the exchange ended in a handshake. Fairbrother said he was on his second run carrying the fridge, which he hopes will help him raise money for Diabetes UK in April, when he noticed a police car turning around. He said: \u201cThey put their blue lights on, held up the traffic and stopped me to find out what on earth was going on. Understandably they had not seen anything like it before. \u201cOne police officer wound down his window and said: \u2018You understand we\u2019ve got to stop you. Is that a fridge on your back?\u2019\u201d After Fairbrother explained his 26-mile challenge, he said the officer joked: \u201cYou do know if you order from Currys, they will deliver it for you?\u201d The fridge-carrying runner added that although it was embarrassing, he did not mind at all. He continued: \u201cI would expect the police to do their job and check on someone running about with a fridge. If I got pulled over another 10 times I wouldn\u2019t be annoyed.\u201d Fairbrother is aiming to raise money for Diabetes UK in support of his best friend, Sam, who has type 1 diabetes. \u201cI tried to undertake a challenge last year, which didn\u2019t go as planned, and I promised to come back bigger and stronger,\u201d he said. A Hertfordshire constabulary spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cWe would like to wish Daniel all the best with training for the marathon.\u201d Fairbrother has named the fridge Tallulah after the bobsleigh in the film Cool Runnings.",

        "body": "Saturday 20 January 10am Over a hundred days have passed. Is anyone but us counting? In the past, I have always wondered about that moment when medical workers, especially doctors, lose that part of themselves where they start dealing with sick people as work and not as humans. Right now, I ask myself whether people around the world witnessing and watching our misery have reached the stage where they think of us as merely news instead of children with dreams for the future; mothers and fathers who wanted a better life for their kids; teachers who wanted to inspire the coming generations; and workers and farmers and musicians who wanted to follow their passion. For the first time since this whole nightmare started, I went to the sea. I forgot how vast and blue it is. It was like meeting an old friend. Everywhere around was packed; people are everywhere. I bet if you take a photo from a bird\u2019s view, all you are going to see is big numbers of heads in the shape of dots, with few spaces available. I sat on the sand and saw a big family by the shore. The women were filling buckets of water, and washing dishes and dirty clothes, while the men went shirtless into the sea with their trousers rolled up above the knees to wash. I saw a man and his son sleeping on a piece of cloth right under the burning sun. I felt sorry for them that they had nothing to cover their faces with. I remembered a discussion I had with Ahmad, the middle son of our host family, about his continuous back pain from sleeping on the ground. He told me that having a roof over his head when he sleeps is a thousand times better than sleeping in a tent or being displaced in schools. He said that we are really blessed. Ahmad keeps surprising me with his acts of kindness. A couple of days ago, he went out and gathered all the children and gave them balloons. He knows all the children, even the ones of the displaced families. And they, and their parents, know him. When he went up, his niece knocked on the door several times to tell him that children who did not get balloons have showed up. He gave her some to give to them. On the shore, there were many people walking. I saw a couple holding hands. I think they are really strong. The fact that they have the ability to express their affection to each other during these horrible times is impressive. There were also children playing with kites, but not normal ones. They were kites made of sewing thread and, instead of pieces of cloth, they had actual notebook papers with homework written on them. They say it is always about the perspective you have when you look or observe a certain situation. At that moment, I looked at the whole scene from the perspective of an exhausted guy crushed by the cruelty of life. I couldn\u2019t see the beauty of the children playing, nor the couple of lovers walking or the acts of survival of displaced people to maintain the bare minimum standards of hygiene, nutrition or shelter. I only saw the empty gazes of people towards the nowhere; I saw sadness all over the place. I saw people with eyes full of tears, I saw those who are desperate for a moment of peace during these chaotic times. I stayed for around two hours. Then I stood up and left. 12.30pm On my way to the house of the hosting family I passed by a pharmacy. I make sure to enter every pharmacy I find and ask for my medicine, and the different types of medicine that my friends or their families take. You never know when a pharmacy might get a couple of pills of any medicine from time to time. I ask the pharmacist about my medicine and expect that he would tell me that he does not have it, but I was wrong. He had one strip of it. I was very happy. I buy it, but on my way out, I go back and tell him that I still have some pills with me. I suggest that he cuts the strip in half and keeps the other half with him in case someone else asks for it. He smiles and says: \u201cThink only of yourself. In these times, it is all about survival.\u201d I don\u2019t agree with him. I insist that he takes half of it in case someone else asks for it. I pass by a huge line of people waiting for bread. I guess the number on the men\u2019s side was over 300 and on the women\u2019s, 200. A guy I know told me that if he could get bread for his family within five hours, he would be lucky. 2pm I arrived at the house of my host family to find four of my friends waiting for me. During the past couple of weeks we all ran into each other on different occasions, and since then, we have started to meet and sit together. None of us had a strong relationship before with each other (except for a married couple), but our relationship strengthened during these times. We chit-chatted for a while, until one guy said: \u201cLook at my shirt! Look at how wrinkled it is. One thing I wish to wear is an ironed shirt. I wish I could go back to the days when I used to take my clothes to the dry cleaner.\u201d I remember my own dry cleaner, and how trusted he was. Several times, he would give me money I forgot in the pockets of my shirts or pants. I wonder where he and his family are now and whether they are still alive. The words of the guy kept repeating in my head; I really wanted to do something nice for him. So, I got an idea. I went quickly and bought some coal. Coal is very expensive these days. It is the \u201cluxurious\u201d alternative, rather than wood, to generate heat. I bought a few pieces, and when I got back, I asked the grandmother if she could help me heat them. She generously agreed. After that, I asked her to give me the smallest frying pan she has. The frying pan was big enough for one egg. I put the coal on the frying pan and then went back. They all looked at me wondering where I went. I said to the guy \u201cTake off your shirt, I think we can make your dream of having an ironed shirt come true.\u201d I laid the shirt on the couch, and I started passing the heated frying pan over the shirt. After a long time and several trials, the shirt was \u201cironed\u201d. If you saw it in a normal context, you would never wear it, but compared to its old state, it was excellent. They were all laughing, encouraging me and, most importantly, asking me to be careful and not drop any coal on the shirt and ruin it. When I finished, he wore the shirt and was very happy. One of the women shared a situation about how scarce clothes are. She looked for days for a hoodie. Finally, she entered a shop and found one \u2013 only one. \u201cThe price was impossible. I refused to buy it. But then, only few minutes later, I decided to get it, since I am afraid I won\u2019t find anything else. I went back, and it was sold!\u201d After a while, one guy turned on a song by Umm Kulthoum on his mobile. Umm Kulthoum is an Egyptian singer who was given the title Star of the East. She had such a strong voice, she sang to big audiences without a microphone. The surprising thing is that, even in times where people look only for the quick songs and TV shows that you could binge watch during the weekend, many of the young generation still love listening to her hour-long songs without feeling bored. We were six people. When the song started, we started singing along and swaying to the music. For a moment, we forgot what is going on around us. We were just a group of friends, from all roads of life, enjoying some music. On their way out, my sister hugged the women and thanked all of them for the fun time we had. 8pm My stomach aches, my back hurts, my knees are killing me. I cannot stop thinking, and reminding myself, that right now I am living the best scenario anyone in Gaza is living. I am privileged to be under a roof, have access to some food and water, be around some nice people \u2013 and staying alive. Other people in Gaza dream of having half of what I do. Still, I am not OK, I am not OK at all. I am the complete opposite of OK. I am sad, broken, hurt, humiliated and displaced. I close my eyes, try to focus on the blue sea I saw today, and I pray for a better tomorrow.",

        "body": "People turning to fertility treatments such as IVF can now access an online tool to compare NHS funding in their area with the rest of the UK. The dashboard, launched by the regulator Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA), is thought to be a world first, and allows those looking to undergo processes such as IVF and ICSI, as well as researchers, to explore data from 1991 onwards, covering 665,690 patients. Among other features, users of the dashboard can filter the 34,725 new egg or 14,665 new sperm donors by year, by ethnicity, and by country of origin; explore the number of patients freezing or thawing their eggs each year \u2013 and the average age of doing so; look at trends for multiple birthrate per year; and explore how IVF success rates differ by age. The dashboard also highlights key statistics revealing, for example, that the percentage of cycles receiving NHS funding has changed from 38% in 2009 to 26% in 2021, while the birthrate per embryo transferred has risen from 7% in 1991 to 23% in 2021. Peter Thompson, the chief executive of the HFEA, said there were more than 70,000 fertility treatments a year in the UK. He said: \u201cAs the fertility sector has progressed over the past 30 years, so too has the opportunity to improve how we present and share data. Our new data dashboards mark the next step in even greater information transparency. \u201cFor researchers, finding out vital data about fertility treatment in the UK previously meant submitting inquiries one by one. The launch of the dashboard will ensure our wealth of data can be used to gain further insight, which could, in turn, improve outcomes for all.\u201d Prof Adam Balen, consultant in reproductive medicine at Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust, welcomed the availability of the data and the transparent approach of the HFEA, noting the HFEA\u2019s data is the greatest repository of information about IVF in the world. He said: \u201cThe new dashboard enables researchers to access data for study and patients to access information to better inform them on their fertility journey and thereby demystify some of the complexities behind the statistics of treatment outcomes.\u201d Stuart Lavery, consultant in reproductive medicine at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: \u201cThis new dashboard from the UK regulator should be welcomed by patients and clinics. Its graphical and table format presents very complex information in a straightforward and simple to understand manner. \u201cIt is a good demonstration of how we can use information from the world\u2019s most comprehensive IVF database for the benefit of patients seeking fertility treatment today. \u201cAlthough I would recommend my patients to use this, I would also advise that the best way to understand your own personal situation and chances of success would be through an individualised consultation with your fertility doctor.\u201d",

        "body": "The first reviews of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, from publications with early access to the company\u2019s attempt to create the next computing platform, talk of a big leap forward for face-mounted computers, for better or worse. The US-only headset, first announced in June last year, aims to move \u201cspatial computing\u201d beyond the limited mixed-reality offered by rivals from Meta, Microsoft and others. It is packed with cutting-edge technology including 3D cameras on the front to capture videos, the ability to blend the real and virtual worlds with hand and eye tracking, plus a display on the front that shows a simulacrum of the wearer\u2019s eyes. But at a cost of $3,499 (about \u00a32,760) in the US it has a lot of work to do to convince consumers and developers alike that it can be anything other than a super-expensive niche toy for tech enthusiasts. The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel called the Vision Pro an \u201castounding product\u201d but one with a lot of big trade-offs, including messing up your hair each time you put it on: \u201cApple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason \u2013 they represent a huge leap forward in display technology,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey also look generally incredible \u2013 sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for colour at the factory so they are also vibrant and colour-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge.\u201d But he said that while the passthrough view of the real world is the very best yet, \u201cthe field of view isn\u2019t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won\u2019t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro\u2019s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3\u2019s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you\u2019re seeing, a bit like you\u2019re looking through binoculars.\u201d CNBC\u2019s Todd Haselton was impressed by the hardware and experience: \u201cI loved watching movies with the headset. I lounged on my couch and put up a huge screen across the wall of my living room and watched an hour of Barbie and the two first episodes of Masters of the Air before the battery was at about 5%. Another night I watched Greyhound. I used the NBA app, which was updated to work on the Vision Pro, to stream four games at once, with the main game in the middle and others pinned to the sides. It\u2019s wild,\u201d he wrote. But he encountered the dreaded app gap problem that plagues new devices. \u201cThe Vision Pro supports more than a million iPhone and iPad apps. But you need to search for each app individually and some of them aren\u2019t available. Netflix and Spotify haven\u2019t been shy about not supporting the Vision Pro, though you can easily access either using the browser. Still, there are lots of others that I couldn\u2019t find: 1Password isn\u2019t there, which made logging into some apps a bit of a pain. You won\u2019t find Uber, DoorDash (but there\u2019s GrubHub!) or Amazon. None of Google\u2019s apps are here, including YouTube TV, though it works fine in the browser. \u201cPopular games like Diablo Immortal and Genshin Impact aren\u2019t available. Facebook\u2019s apps aren\u2019t here, so no Instagram. These are just a few I noticed.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joanna Stern found the Vision Pro was actually good for getting work done, with virtual windows dotted across your view or replicating a Mac\u2019s display, as long as you have other bits of hardware: \u201cThere is a built-in virtual keyboard so you can type in thin air. But it will drive you mad for anything longer than a short message. And selecting smaller buttons with a pinch should be a carnival game. I started getting real work done once I paired the Vision Pro with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. \u201cI levelled up again by connecting my MacBook Pro, which let me write this review on a giant virtual monitor hovering over my desk.\u201d But was it heavy? \u201cOh yes. The metal and glass build gives it a premium look and a weighty feel. One included band has a top strap to lessen the face crush; the other wraps around your head like a comfy tube sock. The Light Seal (not a breed of sea mammal) acts as a cushion and light blocker. Mine is now covered with makeup.\u201d Weight is one of the reasons the headset has an external battery pack tethered to it by a cable, but even then Patel found the magnesium, carbon fibre and aluminium headset a daunting prospect: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it\u2019s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it\u2019s an iPad for your face.\u201d Mark Spoonauer, of Tom\u2019s Guide, found the battery pack to be one of the most annoying things: \u201cThe aluminum battery on the Vision Pro always needs to be with you to use the headset, which is not great. So you\u2019ll need to put it in your pocket while standing or next to you while sitting. It\u2019s 12.4 ounces, which is heavier than an iPhone 15 Pro Max (7.8 ounces). And while the cord is long enough most of the time, if you\u2019re really immersed in a game or other experience and you move suddenly, you could accidentally tug the battery off a table or couch on to the floor.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m also not a fan of how the cord to the battery can sometimes get a bit tangled. A couple of times I had to disconnect the cable so it would straighten out.\u201d Cnet\u2019s Scott Stein said the Vision Pro was \u201ca stunning look at the future\u201d, including ones envisioned in sci-fi: \u201cApple is also expecting the Vision Pro to be a place to see all your own life moments, reliving them like a scene out of Minority Report. I tried watching recorded \u2018spatial videos\u2019, which are 3D videos that I previously shot on an iPhone 15 Pro. I also played back 3D videos and photos recorded directly with Vision Pro, which has its own cameras. \u201cThe photo and video quality in 3D isn\u2019t as good as Apple\u2019s stunning 180-degree immersive video format, not even close. But when expanded to a fuzzy-bordered viewing mode, it starts to feel like a replayed memory. I went back to the holidays, to the Museum of Natural History, to a hotpot dinner with a friend in San Francisco, to a snowball fight with my kid. I started to forget where I was and imagined I could just walk into the moment.\u201d Stein said the Vision Pro was the best wearable display he had ever put on, but still a tough sell in its current form. \u201cAt its price, and with so few VisionOS apps at launch, the Vision Pro isn\u2019t a device I\u2019d recommend to any of my friends or family. If you\u2019re in the immersive industry and can afford one then that\u2019s another story. But for anyone else, I\u2019d recommend you get a free demo at an Apple Store, marvel at its features and wait and see.\u201d",

        "body": "The high bar raised by last year\u2019s Sundance film festival had caused many to feel a little underwhelmed by this year\u2019s edition, a commonly tweeted and spoken concern over just whether this year could truly boast a major breakout movie. Twelve months prior, the workplace thriller Fair Play, erotic drama Passages, nifty horror Talk to Me, romcom Rye Lane, timely documentary 20 Days in Mariupol, mother-son music tale Flora and Son and decade-spanning romance Past Lives caused waves that continued for the next year, an unusually robust lineup, fittingly given that it was Sundance\u2019s big in-person comeback. It was a slightly more muted affair over in Utah this year, some attributing a weaker lineup to 2023\u2019s dual strikes, which prevented many productions from going ahead, but there were still enough gems amid the murk and a promising raft of major multimillion deals. Because while the strikes may have allegedly affected the roster, they also had a definite impact on the thirst of buyers, in frantic need of films to help repair lighter-than-usual release schedules. There might not have been anything as buzzy as Past Lives but this year\u2019s crop of films continued to edge away from a reliance on A-listers to draw attention, a relief after a period of limp, star-led projects taking slots away from smaller, more deserving fare. One of the biggest audience hits of the festival was led by an A-lister but it was a chance to see a major star do something we really hadn\u2019t seen them do before: truly be themselves. Will Ferrell, a chameleonic comedian whose last Sundance offering \u2013 the misjudged remake Downfall \u2013 sank without trace, heads on a crowd-pleasing cross-country road trip in Will &amp; Harper, the twist being that he\u2019s playing himself. In the glossy yet at times deeply emotive documentary, Ferrell goes on the road with Harper, an old friend who has recently transitioned and the two grapple with a new update of an old dynamic as well as a country that actively tries to suppress trans rights. There\u2019s discomfort, tears, laughter as well as a depressingly necessary education to be had, the film perfectly pitched to allow others into an experience they may know very little about. It\u2019s yet to be purchased yet but rumours suggest that a number of major buyers are fighting it out (with Netflix reportedly out in front), the sort of documentary that could become a box office hit and an awards contender. Stay tuned. Another documentary that had people talking, as well as cheering and crying, was Super/Man, a revealing and at times devastating look at the life and death of Christopher Reeve. Packed with A-list friends and intimate, unseen footage, it\u2019s a blockbuster doc that was quickly, wisely snapped by Warner Bros, the studio reportedly planning a release that would involve repromoting old Superman films. With other docs hitting such as Union (focused on Amazon\u2019s growing labor union), Girls State (a sequel to hit Boys State), Skywalkers (a daredevil romance picked up by Netflix) and the audience prize-winning Daughters (centered on a program that brings girls together with their incarcerated fathers), it felt like a strong year for the US, coming just after a rather weak one, with all five Oscar documentary noms coming from international film-makers. The biggest sale of the festival to date was the gimmicky thriller It\u2019s What\u2019s Inside, picked up by Netflix for $17m after bidding out other rival studios. The film, about a pre-wedding party that turns into chaos when an unusual game is played, was made with a low budget and no known stars and will probably be the start of a new franchise for the streamer if all goes to plan. Sundance is known for premiering major new genre titles (past years have seen Get Out, Hereditary and The Babadook all take their bow) and while critical opinion was more divided on that one, there was almost universal agreement on another title also featured in the midnight strand. Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun made an impression at 2021\u2019s virtual Sundance with haunting digi-horror We\u2019re All Going to the World\u2019s Fair and their follow-up I Saw the TV Glow has now cemented their name as one of the most exciting, and daring, new voices we have right now. A sad, troubling story about identity, representation and obsession told through the connection two teenagers have to a Buffy-esque TV show, it\u2019s being positioned as A24\u2019s next genre crossover hit but might face an uphill struggle with more mainstream audiences, pushing more boundaries than the company\u2019s previous attempts Midsommar, Talk to Me or even The Witch. An unusual genre film that might also pose a challenge for audiences is Steven Soderbergh\u2019s experimental ghost story Presence, bought at the festival by Neon. It\u2019s a loosely familiar tale \u2013 family moves into new house, new house is haunted \u2013 but told from a unique perspective. While it comes from the writer of the director\u2019s last genre exercise \u2013 HBO\u2019s excellent thriller Kimi \u2013 it may go the way of Unsane, the 2018 iPhone-shot shocker that struggled to find an audience after a bizarrely bullish wide release. Presence, for all of its technical prowess, might not deliver enough horror or drama to spark with the majority but with Neon forking out just $5m, modest returns might not be a big problem. One of the more surefire commercial hits of the fest came with a name that might not be quite as easy to sell: the coming-of-age comedy My Old Ass. A mostly star-free cast, save for a brief Aubrey Plaza appearance, it sells the kind of slick yet sensitive audience hit that used to make genuine money after premiering at Sundance and it\u2019s no surprise that Amazon-MGM bought it for a major $15m with a wide release planned. The recent sleeper success of Anyone But You, a far weaker film yet with a similarly glossy 00s studio feel, suggests that with the right marketing this could also scratch a similar commercial itch. Searchlight is hoping for another old-fashioned Sundance hit, paying $10m for buddy comedy A Real Pain, one of the more popular on-the-ground premieres of the festival. It\u2019s the second film from Jesse Eisenberg as writer and director, also starring here alongside Kieran Culkin as cousins paying respects to their late grandmother on a guided tour through Poland. After Culkin picked up a Globe and an Emmy for the last season of Succession, expect a supporting actor Oscar campaign for this one. It\u2019s yet to be purchased but artist Titus Kaphar\u2019s stirring family drama Exhibiting Forgiveness, about a painter reconnecting with his addict father, could also be well-positioned for awards with a knockout central performance from Moonlight\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Holland. Saoirse Ronan, who already has four Oscar nominations under her belt, might be on the way to her fifth with knotty recovery drama The Outrun, an every-scene showcase that impressed critics here. It\u2019s also yet to find a US distributor. Kristen Stewart did double-duty at the festival with two wildly different offerings which had wildly different responses. Her first was Love Me, an unusual high-concept romance set in the future between two machines powered by artificial intelligence. Also starring Steven Yeun, who broke out at the festival with Minari back in 2020, the film was dismissed by most as a big bet that didn\u2019t pay off and is yet to be sold. Her other film, gory midnight thriller Love Lies Bleeding, had a far more positive response and with A24 behind it, its mix of in-your-face 80s nostalgia and gory crime theatrics should lead to a decent spring hit when it comes out in cinemas. On the ground, film-makers expressed uncertainty over the future of independent film with many using interviews and Q&amp;As as reminders that the road to the festival is rocky and that even after premiering, nothing is certain. \u201cIndependent film in America becomes more about training people to become Marvel directors and less about creating a viable alternative where more radical visions can be seen and appreciated,\u201d said Schoenbrun, the director of I Saw the TV Glow. Sean Wang, director of the audience award winner D\u00ecdi, added that the industry \u201cis in a very uncertain place\u201d. The festival itself is facing an uncertain future with rumours suggesting that it might move from its Park City home. Locals have long complained about the pressure the festival puts on such a small town while visitors have stressed the difficulties that come with traveling so far out to attend. \u201cThere are challenges,\u201d the Sundance Institute CEO, Joanna Vicente, said. \u201cI mean, accessibility is a challenge. Cost is a challenge.\u201d She added that \u201cthere is a negotiation coming up\u201d.",

        "body": "It has been 10 years since Jane Land and Matthew Glover started a plant-based revolution. In the last decade, the number of vegans in the UK has quadrupled to one million. Here, five readers share how they fared with Veganuary since it launched a decade ago. \u2018The only thing I regret is not doing it sooner\u2019 I tried veganism in January 2014, which coincided with the first Veganuary. I only committed for six weeks, thinking it would be too difficult to go without cheese. I still remember taking a couple of hours to do my first food shop, reading all the labels. Now I\u2019ve been vegan for 10 years, the only thing I regret is not doing it sooner. I don\u2019t even think of meat as food any more. It\u2019s like eating a dead body, which I know sounds a bit extreme. Veganuary is just about trying something for the month to see if it suits you or not. If you\u2019re going to change your intake of food, you do need to do research. But I do think it\u2019s just as easy to be an unhealthy person who isn\u2019t a vegan as it is to be a healthy vegan. Grace Fielder, 44, Milton Keynes \u2018I found a kindred spirit through veganism\u2019 I started Veganuary in 2020, before the world descended into Covid chaos. I\u2019d been leaning that way already, eating less meat, when a friend said: \u201cGive it a go, you love animals\u201d \u2013 so I did. Little did I know this would change my life. I started following social media accounts for vegan recipes and came across a vegan guy in Scotland. I liked his food pictures and he grew vegetables like me. One night, he opened his DMs for those finding Covid hard. We were soon talking daily about vegan food, failed marriages, politics, our love for the Guardian cryptic crossword and of course life during the pandemic. We graduated to phone calls, video chats and watching Gardeners\u2019 World together over a livestream. We found a kindred spirit in the chaos. At the time he lived in Scotland and I lived in Ireland. But in Christmas 2020, you could travel with a negative Covid test \u2013 so I visited him and we were engaged at Edinburgh Castle. When I had to go home, the staff at the airport were very kind to the woman sobbing in departures. In January 2021, there was a similar let-up of Covid restrictions and my Scottish vegan man packed up his life and moved to Ireland. We married in September of that year with a vegan cake. Amber McKay, 52, Roscommon, Ireland \u2018My wife and kids withdrew from our vegan expedition\u2019 For me, [doing Veganuary] this year was all about making a small, positive change for the sake of the environment. I have learned that good vegan food needs to be thought out. The key is having the right ingredients in the cupboard: miso, good pastes, coconut milk, nuts, dried fruit, dried mushrooms. You should treat each ingredient individually to make the flavour. Dry roasting veg helps add depth to the food. To hit the creamy notes, the vegan cheese is just a no for me. However, the vegan coconut-based yoghurts are so nice for a chilli burrito or making a raita. It has been fun and enlightening and I had some shocking periods in the kitchen making vegan mozzarella for our weekly \u201cpizza Fridays\u201d. This was the point at which my wife and kids fully withdrew from our vegan expedition. I\u2019m not going to be fully vegan now. Not having chocolate and cakes is really good, and I don\u2019t miss it. I\u2019m going to be vegan in the working week and then do whatever I wish on the weekend. Matt Haley, 37, Bramhall \u2018I\u2019m not being strict\u2019 I\u2019ve done \u201chalf-arsed Veganuary\u201d, where I try to reduce my dairy and egg intake as much as I can, but I\u2019m not being strict. I\u2019ve been vegetarian for years so the meat part isn\u2019t hard. I\u2019m a massive chocoholic, though, so I\u2019ve missed milk chocolate, but I\u2019ve had dark chocolate instead. The hardest parts have been avoiding ultra-processed food, which so much vegan shop-bought food is, and when I\u2019ve had less choice \u2013 such as when visiting motorway services or attending a family funeral where the spread at the wake was all meat and cheese-based and my vegan option was ready salted crisps. I am not going to start checking through all my beauty products, for instance, to see if they\u2019re vegan. I already check to see if they\u2019re tested on animals. I will make changes to reduce dairy and egg content from now on, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to go fully vegan. Claire, 32, Birmingham \u2018I am still vegan \u2026 What\u2019s not to like?\u2019 I registered for Veganuary in January 2018. Previously, I had been a vegetarian for a long time, but had started buying organic meat. I was under some misapprehension that this was friendly to other species. I remember slicing some organic chicken during 2017 and I had what felt like an epiphany. This was a living, breathing, sentient being and I decided I didn\u2019t want to be part of this anymore. However, I believed that being vegan was quite extreme, so I wasn\u2019t sure where to start. That\u2019s when my friend suggested Veganuary. The experience was fascinating and challenging. I had told my family that I wouldn\u2019t be buying or cooking anything that wasn\u2019t vegan, and they agreed to join me, which helped. I subscribed to a vegan magazine which helped with the meal planning and I bought the Veganuary book which has encouraging advice as well as reminding me why going vegan is important. I watched the recommended films and read widely. All of this made the month really easy. There have been some bumps along the way \u2013 eating dairy by mistake \u2013 but I am still vegan and love it! I\u2019m much more confident with cooking vegan dishes and feel healthy, physically and mentally. What\u2019s not to like? Claire Hardman, 57, Leicester",

        "body": "Academic researchers play an essential role in society and in higher education. By developing specialist knowledge of a subject and creating and disseminating new knowledge, they contribute to society\u2019s development, improve the reputation of a university and make an institution more desirable for students. Technology can be transformative for researchers, giving them the tools to eliminate time-consuming tasks, collaborate with others around the world, and ensure their work is shared \u2013 and challenged and understood \u2013 as widely as possible. Despite this, digital transformation has so far largely focused on teaching and the student experience and has at times overlooked how technology can help researchers to produce and disseminate world-class research more easily. A recent report by the professional services firm EY \u2013 based on a survey of more than 3,000 undergraduate and post-graduate students, group discussions with teaching faculty and professional staff as well as interviews with university leaders around the world \u2013 found that researchers face a number of academic and administrative burdens that can impede their work. The report found that researchers need the equipment, technologies and computing power to support their work and also want tools that will allow them to spend more time on conducting groundbreaking research in new areas. Avantika Tomar, a partner at the consulting firm EY-Parthenon, who focuses on higher education strategy, says researchers want to identify research gaps, foster collaborations and minimise administrative tasks. While universities have often invested in technical equipment and computing power to enable leading-edge research, they have sometimes neglected to focus on other ways in which technology can help researchers succeed. So how can tech free up researchers\u2019 valuable time to better focus on the work they love? Increasing researchers\u2019 bandwidth One of the most time-consuming tasks for researchers is sifting through information and identifying gaps in research that could be further explored. Tomar says: \u201cI did a PhD myself and I remember that everything I would come up with as a potential research topic, someone somewhere in the world had either already done or was currently working on. There\u2019s an overwhelming amount of data available, published in all its forms \u2013 some as articles, some as book chapters, some as books themselves, some as blogs.\u201d However, digital tools such as ResearchGate and academia.edu can ease these burdens. Using the right keywords and themes, researchers can sift through information more efficiently to identify what data they are looking for and find research gaps to explore. \u201cWhat it helps [researchers] do is to save time,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cTime that they can spend on the analytical or insightful part of the research, as opposed to the mundane data-related part. I think time-saving is the biggest thing. You can innovate more when you have the time, headspace and bandwidth.\u201d Spending time on research \u2013 not admin A key frustration for researchers is the amount of time spent on administrative work, EY\u2019s research found. There are a great many administrative tasks associated with conducting academic research, many of which are still paper-based, or require academics to access multiple systems and enter the same data numerous times. Universities can make a real difference to their research communities by improving these processes through technology \u2013 ideally with an end-to-end digital system for the entire research lifecycle and across institution. \u201cIn the future, we aim to realise an environment in which researchers can focus on their research and are not troubled by management tasks,\u201d says Prof Atsushi Kanai, professor at Hosei University in Tokyo. \u201cA good number of procedures require teams to input identical sets of information across multiple documents,\u201d says Prof Yasushi Asami, professor at the University of Tokyo. \u201cWe intend to extend our use of digital transformation to end that type of duplication.\u201d Technology can help to streamline mundane and time-consuming administrative tasks that distract from more meaningful parts of research. Administrative tasks such as grant applications, risk assessments, progress reporting, budget management, reviews and publication could all be made easier by using technology. Building relationships with research partners Technology can also help researchers to connect with each other to share data and ideas, another key priority for research academics, according to EY\u2019s report. Researchers need effective collaboration platforms, tools to share sensitive data securely, and opportunities for face-to-face networking, they said. \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cBuilding relationships with researchers globally takes time and effort; but if you don\u2019t, you will find it difficult to get your paper published or to have a network to attend the right conferences with.\u201d Digital communication tools such as social media, podcasts and video calls help foster collaboration, making it faster, more efficient and easier to connect with others around the world and to share data and ideas, improving the quality of research and widening the pool of potential collaborators, which is particularly helpful for those working in niche fields. Institutions that have embraced technology are already feeling the benefits. As one research academic in Singapore highlighted: \u201cI work so effectively with other researchers all over the world. Our research is being done in different labs in different parts of the world, my co-researchers are able to track results from far away, work with the data, speak to me, speak to my colleagues. It\u2019s a totally different world now, thanks to digital technology.\u201d However, it\u2019s important to not forget the value of face-to-face collaboration \u2013 the sort of water cooler moments that happen naturally in the offline world. To maximise research effectiveness, online and offline collaboration must be championed and nurtured. Universities also need to manage their collaborative tools and information systems carefully and implement robust cybersecurity measures and processes to protect sensitive research data, the report found. Helping research reach a wider audience The impact of even world-class research will be limited if no one has access to it. Digital tools enable researchers to share their work more widely and help people outside of academia to understand it. \u201cSometimes I feel academic research is only meant for academics,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cBut data visualisation tools can help make it more readable for lay audiences, allowing you to showcase your research to policymakers and the corporate world and increase its impact,\u201d Tomar says. Digital tools have the potential to transform the world of research for the better and increase the chances of finding real world application for scientific advancement. However, researchers need access to the right equipment, technologies, and computing power. Digital technologies and sophisticated online resources, such as libraries, large databases, statistical packages and modelling tools, will need to be accessible to all. \u201cA lot of these technologies are not accessible or affordable for every researcher,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cTo get to the point where we are meaningfully using technology, it needs to be more accessible to a wider audience as opposed to a select few.\u201d With the right commitment and tools in place, academics would be able to focus their energies purely on the subjects they\u2019re passionate about and produce world-leading research with fewer obstacles in the way. \u201cWe\u2019ve started moving in the right direction,\u201d Tomar says. \u201cThe tenacity of academic researchers and the implementation of the right technology is transforming research to achieve superior outcomes.\u201d To find out more about harnessing tech to transform research, EY\u2019s latest report into higher education",

        "body": "A digital revolution centred on human experiences could provide teaching and administrative staff working in higher education with more of a valuable resource: time. This is one of the key findings from recent research by the professional services firm EY, based on focus group discussions among 116 teaching faculty and 147 professional staff, as well as interviews with 28 leaders from universities across the world to discover what they want from digital transformation. What the report reveals can help university leaders develop more effective and efficient operations that are built for the people who use them, improving job effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. By automating key processes, implementing joined-up systems that allow for better data sharing and analytics, and utilising new intelligent technology, universities can enhance the experience for their teaching and administrative colleagues. Freeing up time for university staff Sean Jackson, a managing director at EY US specialising in higher education, says technology can help to minimise and eliminate the \u201cwaste\u201d in teachers\u2019 and administrators\u2019 workloads. He believes that \u201chigher education is a system co-created by students and faculty members. Anything that gets in the way of that is subject to legitimate scrutiny,\u201d he says. Digital tools can help reduce mundane and repetitive tasks, he argues, leaving more time and energy for teaching and other core elements. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at what people really value and how technology can be leveraged to maximise that,\u201d Jackson says. As one UK teaching faculty focus group participant asserted: \u201cWe are trying to give back time to pedagogy and teaching by making things quicker. It is now easier to design timetables and organise assessments.\u201d That\u2019s where a digital revolution comes in. Technology can help to eliminate waste, and free up time for staff in higher education to focus on tasks that will deliver more value. Crucially, technology must be built around their needs so they can deliver more efficiently and effectively for students and the university as a whole. Teaching faculty and administrators alike could utilise automated tools that can remove mundane or repetitive tasks such as answering routine student questions, collecting class feedback, and processing applications. Digital tools can also help to automate timetabling and scheduling, while marking tests could be reduced by using digital online assessment and grading tools. This is already a reality in some parts of the world. A faculty focus group participant from Singapore said: \u201cDigitalisation has improved the day-to-day services we need to do and save us time \u2013 even though initially we might take time to familiarise ourselves with the system.\u201d Overstretched administrative staff are still bogged down by low-value, manual tasks, such as processing applications or data entry \u2013 all of which can be automated. \u201cIt\u2019s about increasing the amount of time staff can spend making a difference to the students versus satisfying the system,\u201d says Paul LeBlanc, president of Southern New Hampshire University in the US. Looking ahead, embedded generative AI could soon further lift the administrative burden by creating progress reports, sending emails, and suggesting opportunities for automating other processes. The University of Virginia, also in the US, is one institution that has begun using technology to free up administrators\u2019 time. EY helped the university to develop and deploy an AI-driven virtual HR assistant, CavBot, to provide new staff with a warm and personalised welcome. CavBot answers employee queries and helps new hires to complete onboarding tasks, including filling in forms and applying for security badges or parking permits. Improving the student experience EY research also highlighted staff\u2019s hunger to generate insights that can improve learning experiences and student outcomes as well as support leadership decision-making. Digital processes generate a wealth of data that can be used to create dashboards, reports and trackers, but decentralised and siloed systems mean staff spend an inordinate amount of time looking for different data on different systems. Unifying disparate systems and creating greater cohesion between them enables greater exchange of data and helps intelligent tools to analyse data from different sources, flagging issues and even prompting actions based on insights. With the right systems in place, universities can harness data and analytics to gain more holistic insights into student and staff engagement and proactively offer interventions to improve their experience. For example, at the University of Canterbury, in New Zealand, data is collected on class attendance, assignment submissions and assessment completions. When problems with student engagement are detected, a text is sent automatically, meaning the issue is caught and corrected early and support provided if needed. Their colleagues from across the Australian and New Zealand higher education sector are excited by the opportunities data and automation present. In a focus group, they enthused that it could \u201cbe a huge help for teaching staff and students alike, providing better outcomes for students \u2013 and it\u2019s also positive for staff who can dedicate more time to teaching and research\u201d. Empowering staff There are many potential benefits of a digital transformation. But teaching and non-teaching staff alike need support in using new tools and adapting to digital workflows. In some parts of the world, there is a systematic focus on upskilling staff: in Ireland, the technological university sector is investing heavily in digital transformation, including upskilling staff, developing digital skills training materials, creating a sustainable HE curriculum framework, and implementing shared assessment systems. Helping staff of all kinds to feel empowered will be crucial to the success of any digital transformation, and there are already institutions developing strategies to do this. Some universities have digital champions in each department who act as early adopters and work cross-departmentally to solve common issues. Others have incorporated digital learning into their performance and promotions processes, creating career incentives for those who embrace technology, or build digital skills programmes into their faculty onboarding processes. All of this should be underpinned by ensuring systems and tools are easy to use, and providing accessible, empathetic training and incentives. Overall, better use of technology can save teachers and administrators time and energy, rid them of repetitive tasks, and help them to focus more on students. \u201cBy using technology to help focus the time and attention of faculty and student on what matters most, we see the outlines of a compelling and exciting future begin to emerge,\u201d says Jackson. And as EY\u2019s report outlines, this future could transform the lives of teaching and administrative staff.

In a poll of 2,000 British adults, more than half of those surveyed (56%) said they regretted not spending more time with grandparents and 54% said they hoped to bring them on future holidays. EasyJet\u2019s holiday wing is now offering \u201cgrans go free\u201d places on trips to Europe, after research found half of UK families had never holidayed abroad with their grandparents. Clark says that these holidays can be illuminating. She went to Cornwall with her three children, their partners and her three grandchildren for her birthday and learned a lot about her relatives. \u201cWe got to spend more time with my daughter\u2019s girlfriend. When they met, they lived in Amsterdam, and we had never spent a whole week with her. It was so lovely,\u201d Clark says. \u201cBeing with her was revealing. We learned more about our children\u2019s partners\u2019 politics, the books they had read and their feelings about climate change and the world. We had lively discussions and also boring nights where we sat and chilled out with wine and the TV. We watched some great films. I never realised what a massive fan of Harry Potter my daughter\u2019s partner was.\u201d Clark and her family rented out a big house with four bathrooms, one big lounge and a large dining room. \u201cWe could spread out as well \u2026 it was a treat as it was for my 60th birthday,\u201d she says. One downside, Clark says, however, is the cost. They had to travel in school holidays because of the children, which is much more expensive, so saving up for another big family trip will take time. To keep harmony, Clark suggests ensuring each guest has their own bathroom. \u201cWe also ate together every day and then planned what we would do the following day during dinner. I recommend daily communal eating,\u201d she says, adding that each couple cooked for everyone one night of the week. Annalisa Barbieri, who offers relationship advice in her Guardian column, says her main advice on multigenerational holidays is \u201cdon\u2019t go unless you\u2019re sure\u201d. She adds: \u201cThere\u2019s also nothing like finding out about family when you go on holiday, because seeing someone over a 24-hour period is very illuminating. \u201cIf you tend to be the responsible one, then the chances are you will end up organising everything as people look to you. If you are the only one who speaks a foreign language you will be the de facto translator (this happens to me). Ditto if you are the only driver or the one who doesn\u2019t drink \u2013 you will end up doing the driving after meals out.\u201d Barbieri suggests thinking about what you want to achieve on holiday. \u201cAre some of you late risers? If so, then maybe you need to split the groups so that some of you go out early. I am an early riser and it drives me nuts waiting for everyone to get ready and by the time we get out, everything is super busy.\u201d She adds that she \u201cwould always suggest a separate space if possible so you can retreat to your own space\u201d. This includes staying in a hotel \u201cso that someone else is \u2018in charge\u2019 \u2013 someone else decides when breakfast for example, ie the hotel does! Or adjoining villas or Airbnbs.\u201d She says sharing one big space can lead to tensions. \u201cOne person inevitably does the cooking or cleaning if that hasn\u2019t been decided. So set boundaries early.\u201d Perrin Debock, 52, from Paris, said her parents divorced when she was two. For almost a decade she has taken a big trip with either her mother and her partner, or her father and his wife. She says: \u201cFor me, my daughter, now 15 years old, and my husband, these holidays \u2018en famille\u2019 are special because we bond and share the everyday little surprises of travelling.\u201d Last Christmas they went to Egypt for 10 days with her mother\u2019s side. Their next planned holiday will be to Mexico with the other side of the family. \u201cMy daughter is growing up. It is a precious time to share things and moments with her. I know my parents treasure those. Of course, after a week or 10 days, we are happy to each go back home and not hear about them for some time, but those shared transgenerational holidays are great moments to learn from each other. It is a lot of money and planning to please everyone, of course, but definitely worth it. She adds: \u201cThe preparation before, and the pictures after, offer tons of opportunity to bond over things. I know my daughter will always remember those shared holidays. When my parents disappear, I will have no regrets of not sharing enough with them.\u201d",

        "body": "Becky Lawrence (Letters, 26 January) incorrectly says that faith schools must give highest priority for admission to all looked-after and previously looked-after children (LAC). Paragraph 1.37 of the school admissions code is clear that while they \u201cmay\u201d do this (and I believe many choose to do the decent thing), the legal obligation applies only to LAC \u201cof the faith\u201d. Other LAC can be left until every applicant of the faith has been admitted. It is true that they would be at the front of the queue of all those who are \u201cnot of the faith\u201d; but in many cases this would still not be enough to secure admission. Alan Parker Former schools adjudicator \u2022 Clifford Longley is correct that many of the UK\u2019s 2,200 Catholic schools are owned by that church, and that some may well have been bought from congregation collection money in the distant past (Letters, 26 January). However, they have for many decades been maintained, refurbished and in some cases replaced wholly at the expense of UK taxpayers, most of whom are not religious at all. Longley claims a government buyout of these and other publicly funded religious schools would be prohibitively expensive. I\u2019d suggest therefore that the government compulsorily purchase them at their economic value for educational use, net of the public capital contributions already made. Who knows, the Catholic church and other religions may in fact owe us something. Damian Murray Leeds \u2022 I am not sure what Juliet Chaplin thinks we should learn from reflecting on the large number of people who have died for their faith (Letters, 26 January), but she might like to also consider the equally large numbers who have been more than happy to kill for their faith.

        "body": "A remarkable generation of hyper-astute young female musicians, spanning pop to R&amp;B, indie-rock and beyond, are set to be celebrated at Sunday night\u2019s Grammy awards \u2013 though the biggest prizes could end up being swept by just one of them, Taylor Swift. The top categories are unprecedentedly dominated by women, with only one male artist, Jon Batiste, up for record, album or song of the year. In a week where major research studies in both the US and UK acknowledged progress around representation in a historically male-dominated and often sexist music industry \u2013 while also finding numerous examples of misogyny \u2013 the Grammys are a sign that at female artists, at least, are being celebrated at the highest level. Top of the nominations is the 34-year-old vocalist SZA with nine, following the release of her second studio album, SOS, which topped the US chart, as did its lead single Kill Bill, a deceptively sweet tune carrying a murderous revenge fantasy. Critics thralled to the album\u2019s range \u2013 her core R&amp;B sits alongside hip-hop, folk instrumentation, rowdy rock and more \u2013 and to her often self-lacerating examination of love\u2019s complexity. But the night\u2019s big winner could be Taylor Swift. There\u2019s a sense that industry admiration is behind her following a year in which she dominated pop culture with her album Midnights and the subsequent career-spanning Eras tour \u2013 analysts expect it to make at least $2bn in revenue, over twice as much as the previous highest-grossing tour, by Elton John. Swift is looking to become the first artist to win album of the year four times \u2013 she\u2019s currently tied on three with Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon \u2013 and her track Anti-Hero could earn her first wins in the record and song of the year categories. R&amp;B singer Victoria Mon\u00e9t has seven nominations in her breakthrough year as a solo artist, having previously been nominated as a songwriter for Ariana Grande and Chloe x Halle \u2013 and her two-year-old daughter Hazel, delivering delighted giggles as a featured artist on the song Hollywood, becomes the awards\u2019 youngest ever nominee. Other women with multiple nominations in the top categories are Lana Del Rey, Olivia Rodrigo, Miley Cyrus, Billie Eilish and Boygenius, each with their own particular flavour of heartache and existential angst. If Eilish wins record of the year \u2013 for a third time in five years \u2013 she would have the joint highest number of wins for an artist in that category, alongside Paul Simon and Bruno Mars. Boygenius, the supergroup of indie-rockers Phoebe Bridgers (also up for best pop/duo group performance with SZA), Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus, are up for six awards. They co-produced their debut album with Catherine Marks who has three nominations herself \u2013 but she is the only female producer other than Boygenius, Swift, Eilish and Del Rey listed in the record and album categories, versus 22 men. Marks said the group\u2019s nominations were \u201ckind of mindblowing\u201d, and explained how she tried to create a \u201creally tactile\u201d sound for the album, entitled The Record, made at Rick Rubin\u2019s Shangri-La studio in Malibu. \u201cIt was a beautiful, warm, rich room, which gives the drum tones a lot of power and depth \u2013 we used the room as the fourth identity of The Record,\u201d she said. Marks\u2019s career began 20 years ago when she moved from Australia to London. \u201cI know of stories that are horrendous, but I was lucky with mentors,\u201d she says of being a rare female producer at that time. \u201cThe misogyny I experienced was from other women in the industry, but back then there was a culture of women being pitted against other women, whether consciously or subconsciously. But we now live in a culture where women support other women.\u201d Despite men still dominating production for now \u2013 all five producers in the non-classical category are male \u2013 Marks is heartened by the number of women coming through: \u201cEven in the past year so much has happened.\u201d That diversity, she says, will particularly help young female artists who have otherwise been \u201cworking with old white men \u2013 understandably, their experiences are not shared. Communication could be difficult or they might not feel comfortable enough to express their ideas. So the environment is really important. But there are so many more [producers] to choose from now.\u201d To keep the momentum going, she called for government grants for interns in recording studios: \u201cWe need the next generation to come through, and we want that to be more diverse \u2013 not just gender, but economic, and racial. I hope other people\u2019s road to success is a little more speedy than mine.\u201d She has already got one prize so far this week: the Powerhouse prize at the Resonator awards, celebrating female producers and engineers. It is that ceremony\u2019s debut year \u2013 another sign of a rapidly diversifying industry. The Grammys ceremony, hosted by Trevor Noah at the Crypto.com arena in Los Angeles, will have performances from nominees including SZA, Rodrigo, Eilish and Travis Scott, though two returning legends will probably get the heartiest welcome. Having quit touring and with no new music since 2007, it was once feared that Joni Mitchell\u2019s career was over, especially after she suffered an aneurysm in 2015 that meant she had to learn to walk again. But as she recovered she began a regular series of private jam sessions at her home with luminaries such as Elton John, Paul McCartney and Harry Styles. In July 2022 she took the concept public with an unannounced set at the Newport folk festival, followed in June 2023 by a full return to live performance at the spectacular Gorge Amphitheater in Washington state. She is now performing at the Grammys for the first time, having won nine awards over the years \u2013 though a number of her classic albums such as Blue, Hejira and Ladies of the Canyon were overlooked entirely by the Academy. Billy Joel is also set to perform, likely giving a first public performance of Turn the Lights Back On \u2013 only his second new solo single since 1993. British artists did well at 2023\u2019s awards, with Harry Styles getting album of the year and winning pop categories alongside Adele and Sam Smith, while Wet Leg and Ozzy Osbourne dominated the rock and alternative awards with two wins apiece. This year could be a step down, with Dua Lipa and Fred Again the only British nominees in the \u201cbig four\u201d categories of record, song, album and best new artist, though Fred Again leads a strong showing from the UK\u2019s dance and electronic community: Aphex Twin, the Chemical Brothers, James Blake, Romy and Calvin Harris are nominated alongside him in the genre categories. British producer Mark Ronson has four nominations after he helmed the Barbie soundtrack, which produced a number of hit singles including Dance the Night \u2013 earning Lipa a song of the year nod \u2013 and I\u2019m Just Ken, the ludicrously impassioned power ballad performed by Ryan Gosling. With four nominations, Fred Again \u2013 AKA 30-year-old London-born producer Frederick Gibson \u2013 joins Ronson as the most successful Brit this year, underlining his increasing US fame. An impromptu headline DJ set at California\u2019s Coachella festival last year, with Gibson alongside Skrillex and Four Tet, gobsmacked the crowd and went viral, showcasing his skill for high-intensity emotion and even poignancy amid the banging tempos. Also in 2023 he showcased the quieter end of his craft in a collaborative album with early mentor Brian Eno, and has previously worked behind the scenes with various pop stars including Ed Sheeran, sharing in a song of the year Grammy nomination for Sheeran\u2019s Bad Habits in 2022. This summer he steps up to solo headline status at US festival Bonnaroo and Reading &amp; Leeds in the UK. If Swift wins album of the year the focus will rightly be on her record-breaking achievement, but it will mean her studio engineer Serban Ghenea will actually beat her for the highest number of wins in the category, with five. Ghenea, a Romanian who moved with his family to Canada as a child in 1976, has previously won for Swift\u2019s 1989 and Folklore, plus Adele\u2019s 25 and Bruno Mars\u2019s 24K Magic, and has won 15 Grammys in other categories thanks to work dating back to Justin Timberlake\u2019s 2002 debut album. His work on another album of the year nominee, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Guts, gives him another chance to claim the all-time record.",

        "body": "I have spent much of my adult life moving around. I\u2019ve always worked remotely so have been flexible around my husband\u2019s career. We left the last place after less than a year, because he was made redundant shortly after starting his job. I loved it there and made some great friends, but we left in a rush. I hoped we\u2019d stay permanently in the place we moved to next, but I\u2019ve felt miserable living here and made it my mission to move back to our previous place. Now, after five years \u2013 the longest we have lived anywhere \u2013 we have an opportunity to move back. Initially I was excited, but now I am looking around \u2013 the kids are happily settled in school and I\u2019ve made local friends \u2013 and wondering whether this place might be good enough after all. Or should I take one last leap of faith? I\u2019m worried that perhaps I\u2019m repeating a pattern by leaving again, but equally, I worry that it\u2019s foolish not to move back to the place I love. You titled your letter \u201cAm I repeating a pattern by leaving again?\u201d and it\u2019s interesting you\u2019ve seen there is one. Patterns can be useful pathfinders, or they can be grooves we get stuck in and don\u2019t have the knowledge or confidence to get out of. There were a few unknowns and you didn\u2019t mention any actual places, thus I don\u2019t know if the place you\u2019re in now offers more long-term possibilities than the last one, or how permanent either of those places is. I contacted UKCP psychotherapist Mark Vahrmeyer, no stranger to moving around a lot himself in a previous life (we did a podcast on belonging which you may find interesting). What struck us is how you hoped where you live now would become permanent but then you disliked it so much you made it your \u201cmission to leave\u201d but now having a chance to leave, you\u2019re not sure. Vahrmeyer picked up on how leaving the place you were before, in such a rush, must have been a shock for you. \u201cAlso,\u201d said Vahrmeyer, \u201cI didn\u2019t get much of a sense of your desire, your appetite, what you wanted. Perhaps following your husband\u2019s career provided the excitement, the purveyor of all the adventure?\u201d Was the place you\u2019re in now where you had children, or did you have them before the move? I wonder if either having children, or them getting older and perhaps their needs becoming more obvious, has given you a chance to re-evaluate what\u2019s important to you all as a family. You mention this place being \u201cgood enough\u201d. Being good enough is rather undervalued as a benchmark in the search for the perfect. That said, no one should remain unhappy if they have a chance to change it. \u201cYou say your children are settled,\u201d said Vahrmeyer \u201cand that\u2019s a really good thing, children need stability. Perhaps that\u2019s something to think about alongside what you and your husband want. Maybe you\u2019ve changed and you\u2019re settled [more than you realise?].\u201d \u201cI wonder if the last place,\u201d suggested Vahrmeyer, has become slightly idealised? You were there for such a short time. Was life in general more exciting then?\u201d Are you able to go back to the place you were for a visit, to see how you feel in reality and not fantasy? Nowhere is perfect but it\u2019s about \u201cbeing able to accept disappointment and limitations but still find substance in a place or a person,\u201d said Vahrmeyer. He also wanted you to think about if it\u2019s the \u201cplace that\u2019s making you miserable or the permanence? Is it where you\u2019re living now you find miserable or is it something around the idea of putting down roots?\u201d I also want you to practise an exercise I tried myself over Christmas. I was feeling a little overwhelmed by life, and looked back at my bachelor girl flat with some sentiment. So I really imagined myself there, but as I am now. I went through all the things I like to do now and imagined myself doing them back there. And I realised that neither my parents nor my friends would be round the corner any longer. So much has changed, internally for me, and externally in the place. I saw that what I had now was not only really appealing but I realised I\u2019d made my life the way it was on purpose. I wonder if you could do such an exercise? This may help you really zone in on what actually matters to you now. \u2022 Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

        "body": "It\u2019s not the famous sands of Bondi, the surf mecca of Bells, or the pristine white stretches along the Great Barrier Reef \u2013 but Squeaky beach in Victoria has been named the best in Australia. Named for the under-foot sound of its quartz sand, the Wilson\u2019s Promontory beach is close to the most southerly point of mainland Australia. It becomes the first Victorian beach to top Tourism Australia\u2019s annual list, which celebrates the country\u2019s diversity and some of its lesser-known coastal spots, with The Farm \u2013 also known as Killalea beach \u2013 in Shellharbour, New South Wales, taking second place. Tasmania\u2019s Cockle Creek, Australia\u2019s southernmost beach, was third. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Coastal veteran and former beach ambassador, Brad Farmer, had the \u201ctough, sometimes controversial job\u201d of selecting the final 10 from all 11,761 Australian beaches. Adjunct fellow in tourism and management at the University of Technology of Sydney, David Beirman, said he did not envy the judge, given Australia\u2019s plethora of beaches. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to pick a winner. Whether it\u2019s the longest beach or the best beach or the softest beach or the cleanest beach, we\u2019re embarrassed for choice in that area,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Squeaky beach \u2013 albeit many years ago \u2013 and it did squeak. It\u2019s a fantastic beach. I guess one could argue whether it\u2019s Australia\u2019s best beach. \u201cAs a tourism body, you try and encourage dispersion. This fits the bill, it\u2019s in relatively easy reach from Melbourne and yet it\u2019s very pristine. There are places outside St Kilda beach or Bondi or Manly that are terrific.\u201d He said that accessibility, cleanliness, wildlife, safety and beauty were only some of a range of factors that Farmer would have considered in his selection process. Farmer said the Tourism Australia list was a \u201cchance to uncover some of those destinations that might not be well known but are home to some of Australia\u2019s, and in my opinion the world\u2019s, best beaches\u201d. Madfish Bay in Western Australia was fourth on the list and in fifth place was Cocos Islands\u2019 Pulu Blan Madar island, a crescent of palm-fringed sand surrounded by a 467,054km-square marine sanctuary and part of Australia\u2019s most remote territory. \u201cThe year\u2019s list includes at least one beach from each state, the Northern Territory and even an Australian external territory, which is well off the coast of Australia, but the search for best beaches extends far and wide and one island on the far-flung archipelago caught my eye,\u201d Farmer said. The federal tourism minister, Don Farrell, said \u201cAustralia\u2019s beaches are the best in the world,\u201d while Tourism Australia managing director, Phillipa Harrison, said that the \u201cmajority\u201d of visitors to Australia spend time in the aquatic environment while travelling. Farmer said Australian beaches were \u201cmuch more than just a place to lay a towel and get wet\u201d. \u201cOur coasts have the potential to become this nation\u2019s greatest sustainable resource for generations to come\u201d. Stokes Bay on Kangaroo Island in South Australia took last year\u2019s top spot, while Misery Beach in Western Australia was the 2022 winner.",

        "body": "Edwin on Marjo What were you hoping for? Nice conversation and lots of laughs over delicious food and drinks. First impressions? Friendly, funny, interesting. What did you talk about? Being single parents. Places we\u2019ve been. How our jobs keep us passionate. What we read. Living in Australia as expats. How many best friends she has! Most awkward moment? Maybe when she joked that she was leaving because I haven\u2019t taught my daughter to speak Spanish. Good table manners? Great \u2013 she dealt with the potentially tricky (and gigantic) lobster. Best thing about Marjo? How easy it was talking to her about any topic. No awkward moments. Definitely a people person. Would you introduce Marjo to your friends? 100% yes. Describe Marjo in three words. Friendly, smart, fun. What do you think Marjo made of you? That I was funny (I hope!), a good listener and a good dad. Did you go on anywhere? To the train station. And \u2026 did you kiss? On the cheek, when we met. Hopefully that didn\u2019t seem too forward. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? Not much. Maybe going out on a Saturday would have been slightly more relaxing for both of us. Marks out of 10? 9. Only because of the assumption that 10 is a date that leads to something after. Otherwise: beautiful person, excellent date. Would you meet again? Of course, I\u2019m very happy to keep in touch with the kind, fun and interesting people of this world. Marjo on Edwin What were you hoping for? To meet someone interesting in a new way, a tasty meal and good conversation. First impressions? Laughs from the start. We made some jokes with the waiting staff about our accents, and whether we could all understand each other. What did you talk about? A bit of everything. Changing jobs. Moving to Australia. Kids. The menu. Most awkward moment? It was getting late and I had to collect my son, so I may have rushed the dessert course a bit. Good table manners? Excellent. Best thing about Edwin? Really friendly and easy to chat with. The time passed quickly. Would you introduce Edwin to your friends? It\u2019d be fun to do a Latin dance night with him and the mates \u2013 he could no doubt teach us a thing or two. Describe Edwin in three words. Thoughtful, warm, worldly. What do you think Edwin made of you? Hopefully friendly and talkative. I\u2019d accidentally skipped lunch, so hungry, too \u2013 I was quick to order for the both of us. Did you go on somewhere? We walked to the station together and then I hailed a taxi \u2013 it was quite late. And \u2026 did you kiss? On the cheek. If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? Not having to rush dessert. Marks out of 10? This is tough one. We had a great time and Edwin was lovely, but there was no romantic connection, so I\u2019m going to say 8. Would you meet again? As friends, for sure. Marjo and Edwin ate at Restaurant Hubert, Sydney. Fancy a blind date? Complete this form (Australia only) or email blind.date@theguardian.com",

        "body": "In a cost of living crisis every penny counts, so it\u2019s never been more important to check you are getting everything that is rightfully yours. Last year, retirement advisers at Just Group found that eight in 10 pensioner households eligible to claim benefits were failing to do so \u2013 and missing out on an average of \u00a31,231 a year as a result. Pension credit and council tax reductions were among the unclaimed benefits on its list. Other organisations such as the charity Turn2us say benefits such as the personal independence payment are also overlooked. Then there are tax perks you may be entitled to, prizes you never claimed, and cash in accounts that may have gone astray. So what money may have your name on it? Unclaimed premium bond prizes A total of \u00a381m in premium bond prizes is waiting to be collected. The 2,358,553 unclaimed prizes include six \u00a3100,000 wins, one of which is registered to a bondholder with an Australian address, says the website Savings Champion. They include what could well be the UK\u2019s oldest unclaimed prizes: some \u00a325 wins dating back to 1957. A prize that remains uncashed for 18 months is classed as unclaimed. There is no time limit for claiming a premium bond win \u2013 each prize is held until the rightful owner can be tracked down. Some of these winners may be dead, though. If someone has died, the prize would go to their estate. In many cases the unclaimed prizes have been left sitting in National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I)\u2019s system because the winners have moved house and failed to provide their new address. Some people may have forgotten they even had premium bonds. You can easily check if you have an unclaimed win by using NS&amp;I\u2019s online prize checker or its prize checker app. You will need to know your numbers \u2013 they will be on any letter you have about your account. To trace any lost bonds that you do not have numbers for, you will need to contact NS&amp;I. It has a tracing service you can use. Once you are reunited with your holdings, you can set up to receive prizes directly into your bank account. Lost savings accounts There are more than 150m bank and building society accounts in the UK, and inevitably, some end up getting lost and becoming dormant. This is where an account has been inactive for a long time \u2013 often 15 years \u2013 and the bank, building society or NS&amp;I writes to the customer but no response is received. Luckily, there is a free service called My Lost Account \u2013 at mylostaccount.org.uk \u2013 that can help you trace this money. It brings together the tracing schemes of the banking body UK Finance, the Building Societies Association and NS&amp;I into a single website, so you only need to fill in one application form. The service is aimed at people who are unsure which institution holds their account \u2013 including instances where the bank or building society may have closed or merged with another. Information provided via the online application form is passed to the institutions that may be holding the lost account. They will then carry out a search of their lost accounts. If you know the name of the bank or building society with which you held the account, and that institution still exists, then it\u2019s best to start by contacting them directly. The marriage allowance This is an often-overlooked tax break that applies to couples where one earns less than the personal allowance \u2013 normally \u00a312,570. The lower earner can transfer up to \u00a31,260 of their personal allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner who is earning more than that and therefore paying tax. It only applies if the higher earner is not a higher-rate taxpayer. The transfer reduces the recipient\u2019s tax by up to \u00a3252 a year currently. This is typically done by changing their tax code. The person with the lower income can apply online. It\u2019s free, and they will get an email confirming their application within 24 hours. They can also do it via the self-assessment system (assuming they are already registered and send in a tax return) or by filling in the form MATCF and sending it to the address on the form. Individuals can backdate their claim to include any tax year since 5 April 2019 that they were eligible. Their partner\u2019s tax bill will be reduced depending on the personal allowance rate for the relevant years. Child trust fund cash Child trust funds (CTFs) \u2013 dubbed \u201cbaby bonds\u201d \u2013 were a big deal: more than 6.3m were opened between their launch in 2005 and 2011 when they were scrapped, and billions of pounds are locked up in them. But a lot of these accounts have been forgotten about, which means that for many young people, there is a pot of cash out there that they are unaware of. When children turn 18, they can access their money. The first payouts were made in 2020, and the windfalls will run all the way through until January 2029. If a child\u2019s parents or guardian failed to open a CTF account within a year, HM Revenue and Customs opened one on their behalf. At least 1.7m \u201cRevenue-allocated\u201d accounts were opened. On top of that, some parents will have forgotten about their child\u2019s fund and maybe moved house. Last year MPs were told there may be more than 900,000 unclaimed CTFs with in excess of \u00a31.7bn in them. The Share Foundation, a charity, has been working with the government to help young people find their accounts, and runs a free-to-use search service. Go to findctf.sharefound.org and you will find a simple form you can fill in. HMRC has also created an online tool to help young people find out where their account is held. Attendance allowance The name of this benefit probably doesn\u2019t help take-up \u2013 it\u2019s not clear at first glance who or what it is for. In a nutshell, it is money to help you pay for care if you have reached state pension age and you have an illness or disability that means you need that support. An award of attendance allowance can be worth up to \u00a35,306 a year. In December, a report by the company Policy in Practice and MoneySavingExpert.com claimed that 1.1 million pension-age households could be missing out on \u00a35.2bn of attendance allowance each year. To qualify, you must have needed help or supervision for at least six months \u2013 unless you are terminally ill, in which case you do not have to wait. It is not means-tested, it doesn\u2019t matter if you live alone or with other people and no one checks what you spend it on. It is also tax-free. You can still get it if you live in a care home and pay the home costs yourself. It\u2019s paid weekly, and there are two rates: one if you need help during either the daytime or at night, and one if you need help in both. These rates are currently \u00a368.10 and \u00a3101.75 respectively. You can claim by printing off and filling in a form, or phone the dedicated helpline (0800 731 0122) to request a copy. Citizens Advice says it is best to phone because your payments will be backdated to the date you phoned. You may have to undergo an assessment to check your eligibility if it\u2019s unclear how your illness or disability affects you. Child benefit The high income child benefit charge \u2013 a tax penalty that hits parents earning more than \u00a350,000 a year \u2013 has been around for more than 10 years now. As of August 2022, more than 680,000 families with one or more higher earners had opted out of receiving child benefit in order to avoid being hit by the charge. However, some of those affected will have subsequently lost their job, reduced their hours or taken a pay cut, and as a result are no longer earning \u00a350,000-plus. If you have previously opted out but now earn less, make sure you restart your child benefit payments (assuming you still qualify). Child benefit is worth \u00a324 a week \u2013 or \u00a31,248 a year \u2013 for the oldest or only child. The rate for each additional child is \u00a315.90 a week, or almost \u00a3827 a year. You can reapply by filling in an online form (you need a Government Gateway user ID and password), or by contacting the child benefit office. You can do this online, by phone (0300 200 3100) or by post. Incidentally, new parents can now claim child benefit online for the first time since it was launched, and no longer have to wait up to 16 weeks for their first payment. The new claims process on Gov.uk takes about 10 minutes, with payments made in as little as three days. Council tax discount There are several reasons why you may qualify for a discount on your council tax: it could be that you are on a low income, or that you live alone, or that you share the property with someone who does not have to pay. If you are the only adult in your home, you will get a 25% discount on your council tax bill. When working out how many people live in a property, some aren\u2019t counted \u2013 they are called \u201cdisregarded\u201d people, explains Citizens Advice. That may include a young person, a student or a live-in carer. You may also get a discount if your partner is in a care home long term. The charity\u2019s website has full details. If you are on a low income or claim benefits, you may be eligible for council tax reduction. Contact your council to apply for a reduction. Pension credit One benefit that a lot of people don\u2019t claim is pension credit. This gives people extra money to help with living costs if they are over state pension age and on a low income. It can also help with some housing costs. It tops up your weekly income to \u00a3201.05 if you are single, or your joint weekly income to \u00a3306.85 if you have a partner, and you may be able to get extra sums on top if you have other responsibilities or costs. The government\u2019s figures show that in the 2019-20 financial year up to \u00a31.7bn of available pension credit went unclaimed. On average that added up to about \u00a31,900 a year for each of the up to 850,000 families entitled to receive it who \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 didn\u2019t claim. To find out if you are eligible and how much you could get, use the government\u2019s pension credit calculator. You can apply online, by phone (0800 99 1234) or by post. Bereavement support You may be able to get bereavement support payment if you have lost a partner. The Gov.uk website outlines the eligibility, how much you might be able to get and how to apply (you can do it online, by phone or by post). If this does apply to you, a crucial date is only a few days away. Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, says that if you are unmarried, have children and your partner died between 9 April 2001 and 8 February 2023, you can possibly claim up to \u00a340,000 of backdated bereavement support, but only until 8 February this year. (The deadline relates to a law change after a court ruling.) Lewis says that if you are unsure if you qualify, \u201cjust do it! The deadline\u2019s so close, cross [your] fingers and apply.\u201d Help that is available \u2022 Entitledto: the website entitledto.co.uk has a calculator you can use to see if you qualify for any state benefits. You need to answer questions about your household situation and your income, and it presents a list of any payments you may be entitled to. For each one it offers information and details of how to make a claim. \u2022 Turn2us: the charity also offers a calculator, at benefits-calculator.turn2us.org.uk. You will need the same details to answer its questions. At the end it also presents a list of benefits you may qualify for, plus links to the sites you will need to go to if you want to start a claim. Turn2us also has a \u201cgrants search\u201d tool where you can find out if you could get help from charitable grants. \u2022 Citizens Advice: the website citizensadvice.org.uk has information on benefits and a calculator. The charity also offers help via the phone or in person. You can search for your local office online, or call the adviceline on 0800 144 8848 in England or 0800 702 2020 in Wales. \u2022 Age UK: the charity offers various services including an advice line (0800 678 1602) that can help with things such as finding out about benefits you could claim and how to go about doing that.",

        "body": "Born and raised in Cork, in the south-west of Ireland, the theatre, film and television actor Sarah Greene was just six years old when she first stepped on stage, performing in local musical theatre and pantomimes. She later attended Cada Performing Arts school in Cork and then the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin, from which she graduated in 2006. Greene\u2019s interpretation of Helen in Martin McDonagh\u2019s The Cripple of Inishmaan in 2013 earned her Olivier and Tony award nominations, while her screen credits include Bad Sisters, Normal People, Vikings and Dublin Murders. Now 39, she lives in London and Belfast with her partner and son. Greene is currently starring in Sexy Beast on Paramount+. When I was five years old, I was cast as the Virgin Mary in the infants\u2019 school nativity play. With my blue cape and stern expression, I took the role incredibly seriously. I was very much in character as a committed mother. I actually still have that Tiny Tears doll at my family home in Cork, although she\u2019s missing a lot of hair. When I wasn\u2019t performing, I liked to give her locks a chop. Particularly the fringe. The following year, it was decided that the school would give another child a chance at Mary. The teachers thought it would be a good idea to pull the name of the next girl to play the role out of a hat. When they did that, it was Sarah Greene, yet again. I was Mary two years in a row, much to the disdain of some of the other girls\u2019 mothers. It was a real drama, a proper controversy. Even though I was young, I had already realised that acting was my ambition. Around this time, my parents had got me tickets in the dress circle to see Cinderella at Cork opera house, and while I was watching it, all I could think about was how I longed to be with the actors on stage. You wouldn\u2019t have guessed it to meet me back then; I was very quiet and super shy, far from an extrovert. I found interactions with people I didn\u2019t know agonising. I have memories of my mum asking me to go into the supermarket on my own and absolutely hating it. Acting helped my confidence grow. What I loved most was putting on masks and being able to express myself through other characters. At the age of six, I entered a talent competition. My solo performance was Miss Hannigan in Annie and I really threw myself into it \u2013 walking around the stage holding an empty bottle of vodka and wearing my mum\u2019s high heels. Everyone was terrified I would trip up and break my ankles, but I adored pretending to be this drunk woman singing Little Girls. I came second and it was all the encouragement I needed to know this was the life for me. Being on stage was where I felt my best self. My childhood was very outdoorsy: running around the fields and woods that surrounded the old farmhouse I grew up in. When my parents originally bought it they had no intention of becoming farmers, but they inherited lots of potbellied pigs, cats and dogs from the previous owner \u2013 chickens, too. We didn\u2019t even eat their eggs as we considered them our pets. It was all very wholesome. My mum was a stay-at-home mother and my dad worked in telecommunications, and still does. Even though acting was an unknown profession to them, they were unbelievably supportive, especially as there were a few teachers who would complain because I was missing so much school \u2013 although I wasn\u2019t lagging behind. From a very young age I was driven, and my parents encouraged me at every step because they were so relieved I\u2019d found something I was passionate about. I\u2019ve made sure they have always come along for the ride \u2013 they have joined me at awards shows and when I\u2019ve been performing in New York and filming in France. They have been there for the less glamorous jobs, too. I remember my dad coming to see me when I was in a not very good play in Dublin. At the end, he was the only person giving a standing ovation. Afterwards, I said: \u201cOh no! Dad, you didn\u2019t need to stand.\u201d He said: \u201cI\u2019ve always stood, and I always will stand for you.\u201d I had worked for years in Irish theatre, and had done a couple of films along the way, but it wasn\u2019t until The Cripple of Inishmaan that film and TV really opened their doors to me. The Tony nomination put me on the map. I was up against some phenomenal talent, so I wasn\u2019t worried that I would have to get up on the platform and give a speech, but it was a brilliant and surreal night \u2013 and something that totally changed the course of my career. It wasn\u2019t always easy. The first time I remember being rejected by a production and feeling hurt was when I was 10. I had auditioned for the Cork Operatic Society\u2019s production of The Sound of Music, and had to sing Happy Birthday \u2013 which is actually a really hard song to sing. I didn\u2019t get it, and was heartbroken. Devastated. My parents said: \u201cIf this is the job you want to do, you\u2019re going to have to get used to that.\u201d There are still times when I\u2019m quite sad about not getting a role, but I\u2019ve since come to realise that it\u2019s often nothing to do with your talent \u2013 it\u2019s what you look like, your height or something fundamental that is completely out of your hands. When it comes to surviving the entertainment industry as a woman today, it certainly feels like the landscape is changing for the better. I\u2019ve been fortunate to be consistently surrounded by inspirational women throughout my career: when I was doing panto and plays as a child, I was performing with a lot of female actors from different generations, who taught me so many skills and opened me up socially. I became a mum a few years ago and it has definitely exposed me to new emotions. However, before I had my son, I\u2019d already explored maternal roles: first as Rosie in the 2018 film of the same name; and then as Lorraine in Normal People. I was on set on the first day of filming Normal People, and from the opening scene I realised that Paul [Mescal] and Daisy [Edgar-Jones] were electric and that we were in the presence of something great. Quite rightly, they have since become superstars, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want their level of fame. I like to be able to sit in a restaurant, eat some food, and for no one to look at me. I want to be able to have a conversation and not feel like I am being eavesdropped on. The older I get, the more I just want to do my job, come home, see my little boy and try to get him to bed. I don\u2019t put up with crap any more. I\u2019m very capable of speaking my mind if I think something\u2019s not right, which I didn\u2019t do so much when I was younger, as I was scared to rock the boat and lose the job. Not that I have much cause to speak out at the moment \u2013 I\u2019m in the middle of shooting the new series of Bad Sisters, so I\u2019m surrounded by incredibly powerful, smart, supportive women every day on set. From our lord and saviour Sharon Horgan, the genius that she is, to its directors and producers, the whole show is female-led, which I find really sexy and exciting. While I care less what people think of me, I am, and always have been, a bit of a people-pleaser. When I look at this photo, I see a little girl who wants to be someone\u2019s best friend. I\u2019d love to go back and give her a hug, and tell her life\u2019s going to be cool and that even though it sometimes feels like she\u2019s the shyest kid in the room, she\u2019s not so quiet any more.",

        "body": "Wayne Kramer used to tell a remarkable story about the first time he realised how influential his music had become. It was 1976, and he read an article in Billboard magazine about the Ramones and the burgeoning New York punk scene, which \u201ckept saying that these kind of bands were inspired by the MC5\u201d. Kramer was so horrified, he tore the magazine up and flushed it down the nearest toilet. He was in a federal prison in Kentucky, serving a four-year sentence for drug offences and, as he put it, \u201cfrom where I was sat, \u2018punk\u2019 did not have a good ring to it\u201d. \u201cIn jail, a punk is somebody that they knock down and make their girlfriend, you know: \u2018I\u2019m gonna make you my punk\u2019,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThat kind of talk could get you killed, right?\u201d It\u2019s a story that tells you a great deal, both about the MC5\u2019s importance and the lucklessness that dogged their career. The three albums they made between 1969 and 1971 were indeed set texts for aspiring punk bands and continued to reverberate through rock music. When Kramer reconvened the three surviving members of the MC5 in the 21st century, he was swamped by musicians wanting to fill in for their late vocalist Rob Tyner and guitarist Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith: Lemmy, Don Was, the Cult\u2019s Ian Astbury and Dave Vanian of the Damned all performed, as did members of Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Fugazi, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Faith No More, Pearl Jam and progressive metal pioneers King\u2019s X. But for all the undoubted brilliance of their albums, the MC5\u2019s actual career often resembled a band lurching from one disaster to the next \u2013 hype, mediocre sales, wounding battles with record companies, retailers and gig promoters, hard drugs \u2013 and, by the time of their split, Kramer was more or less destitute: broke and addicted to heroin, he became a petty criminal and drug dealer, hence the prison sentence. A number of the band\u2019s problems stemmed from a revolutionary political stance, which it wasn\u2019t even clear that the members actually believed in. Kramer claimed the band only glommed on to political activist John Sinclair, who became their manager, \u201cbecause we started to see the hippy thing was gonna be big \u2026 we figured the way to get hippies to like us was to get the chief hippy to like us, who was John Sinclair\u201d, and that their own politics extended little further than \u201cnot wanting to get up in the morning and have a real job\u201d. But if their commitment to actually overthrowing The Man was questionable at best, the MC5\u2019s music brooked little argument. Kramer liked to note that the first gig he ever saw was Del Shannon performing at a Detroit drag strip, and that he felt there was little difference between rock\u2019n\u2019roll and the sound of drag racers: \u201cloud and fast, just like the music\u201d. That kind of thinking certainly informed one aspect of his playing \u2013 on the MC5\u2019s legendary debut album Kick Out the Jams, Kramer\u2019s guitar is frantic and distorted and stinging: as one critic noted, he often seems to be flaying the guitar as much as playing it \u2013 but Kramer was always a more complex musician than the proto-punk tag allows for. He was a jazz fan, alive to the startling developments that were taking place in the music of John Coltrane and Sun Ra in the mid-60s. The MC5 might have initially presented themselves as the archetypical American garage rock band \u2013 their debut single was a cover of Them\u2019s I Can Only Give You Everything, a staple of garage bands the country over \u2013 but Kramer was already attempting to work his love of free jazz into their music: there was an edge of atonality and barely controlled chaos to his playing on their second single Looking At You; the early MC5 were as likely to hit audiences with the lengthy Black to Comm, on which a tough riff shades into free improvisation, as they were to play covers of I\u2019m a Man or Baby Please Don\u2019t Go. By the time Kick Out the Jams was recorded, live at Detroit\u2019s Grande Ballroom in December 1968, their sound had become denser and heavier \u2013 the title track boasts one of the all-time-great hard rock riffs; the sludgy I Want You Right Now sounds like the MC5 are engaged in inventing grunge 20 years too early \u2013 but the free jazz influence remained, most obviously on the closing Starship, based on a poem by Sun Ra, strafed by bursts of improvised noise. It was an extraordinary, incendiary debut, but its release was scuppered both by battles with retailers over the word \u201cmotherfucker\u201d appearing in the lyrics and John Sinclair\u2019s liner notes \u2013 which ultimately led to them being dropped by their label \u2013 and by what you might call the MC5\u2019s strained relationship with the revolutionary stance the album occasionally espoused. The MC5 had got a lot of countercultural kudos for being the only band to play for the demonstrators outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, but when they arrived at a 1969 New York gig in a limousine, the radical hippy audience denounced them as traitors, rioted and smashed their equipment up, leading promoter Bill Graham to blackball the band. By the time of their second album, 1970\u2019s Back in the USA, they had been expelled from Sinclair\u2019s White Panther party for \u201ccounter-revolutionary ideals\u201d \u2013 the band members had spent part of their advance from their new label Atlantic on a sports car each \u2013 which you rather got the impression came as a relief. Certainly, the album significantly dialled down the lyrical politicking, as well as trying to make the band sound more approachable: shorter songs, less improvisation, a couple of old rock\u2019n\u2019roll covers, a ballad. The material was often great \u2013 Shakin\u2019 Street, Tonight, Let Me Try \u2013 as was Kramer\u2019s guitar playing, which was particularly fantastic on The Human Being Lawnmower, and it might have worked were it not for an abysmal production job, which left them sounding tinny and weedy, as if the whole thing were coming out of a tiny transistor radio. The following year\u2019s High Time was a vast improvement. Kramer often opined that it was the MC5\u2019s best album; certainly it was their broadest in scope, balancing hard-driving rock\u2019n\u2019roll, as on Sister Anne, with anarchic experimentation \u2013 the closing Skunk (Sonically Speaking) was their most clearly jazz-indebted piece yet, complete with a horn section \u2013 and Kramer\u2019s Miss X, a kind of epic rock ballad that potentially pointed towards a fresh musical direction in the future. But, as it turned out, there was no future. The album flopped, the drug problems increased and the MC5 broke up in 1972: only a few dozen people turned up to their farewell gig at the Grande Ballroom, the same venue they had packed out for the recording of Kick Out the Jams, and Kramer fled the stage, distraught, before the end. You might have expected punk to reinvigorate Wayne Kramer\u2019s career, but it didn\u2019t quite work out that way. He liked to suggest that his time in prison improved his guitar playing \u2013 he encountered jazz trumpeter, former Charlie Parker sideman and fellow junkie Red Rodney behind bars, who gave him lessons in improvisation \u2013 and he played an integral role on Was (Not Was)\u2019s eponymous 1981 debut album, his guitar sprawling magnificently over the dancefloor rhythms of Wheel Me Out and Tell Me I\u2019m Dreaming, but he was still struggling with drugs. Under the circumstances, attempting to form a band with rock\u2019s most unrepentant junkie Johnny Thunders probably wasn\u2019t such a hot idea: the rough live recordings that exist of Gang War have their adherents, and the Kramer-sung cover of Jimmy Cliff\u2019s The Harder They Come is genuinely impressive, imbued with a rueful power, but the whole thing fell apart before they recorded a single original song. Kramer spent the rest of the 80s working as a carpenter, playing only intermittently. His solo career only really kicked off with 1995\u2019s The Hard Stuff, the first of a series of impressive, but overlooked albums he recorded for punk label Epitaph: they offered a more straightforward brand of hard rock than the MC5 had at their peak, but the songs were strong, the lyrics unflinching in their portrayal of addiction \u2013 listen to Junkie Romance or It\u2019s Never Enough, from 1996\u2019s Dangerous Madness \u2013 and Kramer\u2019s guitar never failed to wail thrillingly. Citizen Wayne released in 1997 is probably the best of the lot: produced by Don Was, it offered an autobiographical suite of songs that shifted him out of his latter-day comfort zone into more experimental electronic territory, a brave gamble that paid off on the idiosyncratic Dope For Democracy and Count Time. He spent most of the 21st century consumed by various warmly received MC5 reunions and, increasingly, advocacy: he became involved with charities that dealt with drug addiction and fronted the American wing of Billy Bragg\u2019s Jail Guitar Doors, which provided musical equipment to prisoners as a means of rehabilitation. He published a brutally honest autobiography and, catalysed by the Trump presidency \u2013 \u201che gave permission for every asshole in the world to be assholes\u201d \u2013 started work on a new MC5 album. He could be winningly indifferent about the band\u2019s legacy, finding fault with every album they released (even Kick Out the Jams, he suggested, \u201cdidn\u2019t catch us on a particularly great night\u201d) and dismissive of the music they continued to inspire, claiming most of it missed their experimental side that he \u201ccould hear more original things in hip-hop\u201d. But you suspected that Wayne Kramer knew exactly how powerful the MC5 had been, and that their music would always be a galvanising force for anyone interested in making raucous, exploratory, righteously pissed-off but euphoric rock\u2019n\u2019roll, whatever he thought of the results. \u201cThe band always represented an unlimited sense of possibilities and action,\u201d he told an interviewer in 2022. \u201cWe were talking about kicking out the jams, not handing out the jams or thinking about the jams. We were talking about taking action.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 February 2024. Rob Tyner was the vocalist, not bassist, for MC5, while Fred \u201cSonic\u201d Smith was the guitarist, not vocalist.",

        "body": "It was 1971 and I was standing on a dusty road on the Costa Blanca, Spain. I was with three travel-weary friends who were hitchhiking to a small fishing village for an epic reunion of travellers who had met at Oktoberfest in Munich the month before and had agreed to meet up again in Calpe. As we stood under the Spanish sun, a black car pulled up. Inside was this strangely dressed guy in a beach hat with a charming smile. He asked where we were headed and when we mentioned the reunion, he said: \u201cHi, I\u2019m Philip. Hop in, I\u2019m heading there too.\u201d There were three villas where all the travellers were staying \u2013 an American villa (where I was lodged with my London friends), a Canadian villa and an Australian villa. Needless to say the Aussie villa was the wildest and most fun. Life in Calpe was picnic excursions to the countryside, beach volleyball, dinners at various villas and some very wild parties. I remember at one such gathering, Philip and a friend went to the local bodega and spent all our contributions on as much alcohol as they could find. That evening, they mixed up a giant tub of sangria with every form of alcohol imaginable, topped off with some chunks of fruit. I remember remarking that it looked potent; they said it was \u201cjust a fruit drink\u201d. By dawn, there were bodies collapsed on the lawn, people honking into bushes and heaving out of windows. Some fruit drink! At first I thought Philip was an unusual guy. He wore shoes that were too big and flipped open at the end so his toes hung out, and a long, oversized coat. One night at a party at the Australian villa, I was reading palms when Philip flicked his open hand over my shoulder and said, \u201cRead mine, Rhodesiac\u201d (I was from Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe.) He was wearing his striped towelling hat and flamboyant pink board shorts covered in fish (his mum made them from old curtains). As I held his hand in mine, it felt strong but gentle and safe. He was stunned by what I sensed on his palm \u2013 a few skeletons in the closet from his past. He anxiously asked me if his best friend had divulged something; to which I replied: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d While holding his hand, I had this sixth sense that this would be the hand that would hold my babies. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time and only brought it up a few years later when we were married. I have never forgotten it. It was Franco\u2019s Spain, and the beautiful young people were warned not to go on the beach at night for fear of being shot. So at night we stuck to our villas and partied on. Some days I felt the need to be alone and escape from all the madness and personalities and would head off to a small beach hotel for afternoon tea. Philip would often sing out, \u201cRhodesiac, can I come too?\u201d We would sit and drink tea, gazing at the Mediterranean. I was getting fonder and fonder of this guy who seemed to understand my black moods. Friends said there was electricity between us. Every time I turned around his big green eyes were riveted on mine. It was the happiest I have ever felt. Then, Philip headed to Italy and Greece with his friends, and life in Calpe became dull. The next time we met was at a party in London, and this was where we really fell in love. Sadly, I had to return to war-torn Rhodesia and my family. A couple of months later, Philip arrived and we were married beneath a southern African sky. More than 50 years and four beautiful children later, we are now travelling the globe together in our golden years. The one thing we\u2019ve always had in common is our passion for travel. I believe meeting Philip was kismet. Destiny. I\u2019m so grateful our two stars crossed paths. *** Is there a moment you knew?",

        "body": "It\u2019s been four years, a pandemic and two seasons of his US show Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay since Josh Thomas last toured Australian stages, with 2019\u2019s Whoopsie Daisy. Though he started in standup as a teen (winning Melbourne international comedy festival\u2019s Raw Comedy competition at 17), Thomas jettisoned that part of his practice once he\u2019d made the move to TV in 2013, with his sweet, spiky, deliciously awkward and surprisingly touching series Please Like Me. Thomas has been fairly candid over the years about preferring the small screen as a vehicle for his material, saying that he\u2019ll only put together a new standup show if he has something to say. Whoopsie Daisy was mostly about the culture shock of moving to Los Angeles in the wake of Please Like Me\u2019s surprise US success; he\u2019d done the twink pool parties and the Hollywood meetings, and had a swag of loopy anecdotes to prove it \u2013 but he was also characteristically candid about his discomfort, and even unhappiness, in his new social milieu. In his new show, Let\u2019s Tidy Up, which lands at Sydney Opera House off the back of a US tour and before an Australian one, Thomas takes stock of his life in the wake of two significant diagnoses. The first was ADHD. \u201cWhen I got diagnosed nine years ago it was still on the cusp of being quite interesting,\u201d he says self-consciously in the show\u2019s opening stretch. \u201cEveryone has it now.\u201d Then two years ago, while making Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay \u2013 an LA-set show in which a thinly veiled version of himself takes legal guardianship over his two teenage half-sisters, one of them on the autism spectrum \u2013 he was diagnosed with autism: \u201cAnd that\u2019s got an edge, that\u2019s drama \u2013 that\u2019s a show!\u201d he jokes on stage. Let\u2019s Tidy Up pivots off an episode roughly two years ago in which Thomas tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to tidy his house, and the attendant fallout. It\u2019s a disarmingly relatable tale, told in that hyperactive Josh Thomas style; it starts with him buying a sous vide and needing a place to store it, and proceeds as he unspools a hoarder\u2019s-house worth of \u201cstuff\u201d from every nook and cranny. This episode is the loose spine of a show in which Thomas interrogates whether he should, or even can, change \u2013 and the slightly chilling effect that being formally diagnosed has had on his perspective. As he remarks in the show\u2019s opening, having a psychiatrist confirm that the world is indeed more challenging for him was unambiguously reassuring; being told that there was nothing he could do about it \u2013 that his behaviours are \u201cincurable\u201d \u2013 triggers more ambivalent feelings. It\u2019s a solid premise for a show, and Thomas takes satisfying aim at the self-improvement culture that is endemic to America, Instagram, capitalism and celebrity culture. The meat of the show, however, is personal anecdote, covering territory familiar to fans of his TV shows: childhood ignominies, adult faux pas, awkward social situations and dates; there are jokes about anal sex, herpes and Tinder. Some of the material perhaps feels overly familiar (there\u2019s a bit about his struggles with small talk that seems lifted from his 2019 show, and covered in his TV work: \u201cMy friends said I need to ask questions and then listen to the answers,\u201d he marvels. \u201cDo you know about this?\u201d) For better or worse, there are no real surprises to this show for those familiar with Thomas\u2019s work. Curiously, he co-wrote it with LA-based Australian expat Lally Katz, whom local theatre nerds may remember as the writer of oddball treats such as Atlantis and The Cat as well as her own brilliant one-woman show, Stories I Want to Tell You in Person. There are kooky flourishes that feel quintessentially Katz, and her authorial hand is referenced in the show (she also appears as a vivid, charismatic character in several anecdotes). But for a show with this kind of theatre pedigree, you might expect more of a narrative arc. Instead, the show feels chaotic in energy and structure, unfolding as a series of anecdotes within anecdotes; there\u2019s no real sense of the stakes. Thomas starts the show on a stage covered in confetti, in front of a table loaded with junk, with the declaration that he\u2019s never been to therapy and he\u2019s never going to, \u201cbecause I think that I\u2019m fine\u201d. 70-odd minutes later, there\u2019s more confetti \u2013 but less revelation than one might hope. Josh Thomas\u2019s standup show Let\u2019s Tidy Up runs at Sydney Opera House until 18 February, before touring Australia until May. Find out more",

        "body": "West Point, the US\u2019s academy for army officers, can still consider race in its admission process for now after the federal supreme court refused to immediately force a change to the school\u2019s policies. The supreme court\u2019s decision on Friday rebuffed a request by a conservative group to alter West Point\u2019s admissions process, which takes race \u2013 as well as a host of other factors \u2013 when selecting students who aspire to be future army officers. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, argued that the selection process was unconstitutional. It has previously found success in challenging selection criteria, with the supreme court agreeing to end affirmative action in higher education last year by striking down the race-conscious admissions policies at the universities of Harvard and North Carolina. However, while the latest ruling by a supreme court dominated by conservative justices did not fully resolve whether institutions like West Point could use race-based criteria for admissions, it refused to immediately accede to the complaint. \u201cThe record before this court is underdeveloped, and this order should not be construed as expressing any view on the merits of the constitutional question,\u201d the supreme court\u2019s order said. The US military\u2019s academies \u2013 including West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy and the Coast Guard Academy \u2013 have used race as a factor in choosing cadets for several years. Their goal is to reflect in officer positions the diversity of rank-and-file members of the military, as well as to reflect the diversity of the US itself. \u201cOur nation\u2019s military leaders have determined that a diverse army officer corps is a national security imperative and that achieving that diversity requires limited consideration of race in selecting those who join the army as cadets,\u201d Elizabeth Prelogar, the solicitor general, told the supreme court justices in a hearing that followed a decision by a lower court to not block West Point\u2019s admissions process. Students for Fair Admissions, which has also challenged the admissions process for the Naval Academy, criticized the court\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is disappointing that the young men and women who apply to West Point for the foreseeable future will have their race used as a factor to admit or reject them,\u201d said Edward Blum, president of the group. \u201cEvery year this case languishes in discovery, trial and appeals means that our nation\u2019s best and brightest young men and women will be classified, sorted and preferred based on their skin color rather than just on their abilities.\u201d",

        "body": "Labour is facing calls from MPs to back the provision of free school meals for all primary school children in England, after a new study found evidence that it reduces obesity and boosts reading skills. Levels of obesity were reduced by 7% to 11% among reception children in the four London boroughs that have already adopted the policy, according to the study seen by the Observer. For children in year six, who had been given free school meals for their entire time in primary school, there was a 5-8% reduction. The study, by the Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex, found that apart from the cost of living help to parents, there was an associated increase in reading. It suggested that by the age of 11, the impact was equivalent to \u201capproximately two weeks\u2019 additional progress in school\u201d. It also found that making free school meals universal also increased their take-up by those who had already been entitled to them by 8%, possibly because it changed school culture and the stigma around having them. It appeared to lead to one in three children eating a school lunch for the first time. In England, all reception, year one and year two children are entitled to free lunches. Blanket free school meals have now been rolled out by London mayor Sadiq Khan across the capital until next year. All primary school children in Wales and Scotland are due to receive free school meals from this year. Offering free meals to all state primary school pupils would cost about \u00a31bn a year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. A series of Labour MPs called for the national rollout of free meals. Stephen Timms, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said the policy was in place and working within his London borough. \u201cThe policy has been hugely popular among parents, and the research now shows that it is making a real difference to children\u2019s health and learning,\u201d he said. \u201cI welcome the decision by the mayor of London to extend the policy London-wide. It should be rolled out nationally, too.\u201d Kim Johnson, the Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, said that in her city, an average of 11 children in a class of 30 live in poverty. \u201cAccess to healthy, nutritious food is a necessity for children to thrive,\u201d she said. \u201cI have long supported the NEU\u2019s No Child Left Behind campaign to roll out universal free school meals to all primary and secondary pupils ... to ensure that hunger doesn\u2019t prevent children from learning, from reaching their full potential.\u201d Sharon Hodgson, chair of the all-party group on school food, said ministers had had evidence since 2013 on the benefits of such a scheme. \u201cUniversalism breaks the stigma of means-tested free school meals and breaks the cycle of inequalities that exist outside the school gates being reproduced in the dining hall,\u201d she said. \u201cSchool food is the best public health policy we have at our disposal. With it we have the opportunity to reach every child in the UK with hot, healthy, nutritious meals. That is why I have been calling for universal free school meals for over 14 years.\u201d Khan said he had \u201cpersonal experience\u201d of the difference free school meals can make. \u201cDelivering these meals to all state primary schoolchildren in London has been one of my proudest moments as mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has been fantastic to hear from teachers about how much better pupils are performing this year and also how much families have benefited, with parents not having to worry about how to feed their children. As this study shows, providing all children with the offer of a nutritious meal during the school day helps to improve health and enable pupils to focus on their schoolwork, rather than worry about being hungry.\u201d Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, has pledged to have breakfast clubs in every primary school, funded from the abolition of non-dom tax status. However, the party has no plans to expand free school lunches. Researchers examined the impact of expanding the policy to all primary school children by studying four London boroughs \u2013 Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Newham and Islington \u2013 which have their own schemes. \u201cThere are lots of long-term benefits that we\u2019d expect, such as an improvement in reading ability, even at the end of primary school,\u201d said Dr Angus Holford, the study\u2019s co-author. \u201cOther evidence suggests this will persist into a benefit in lifetime earnings. Even if these effects on obesity prevalence don\u2019t fully persist into adulthood, even delaying the onset of obesity, or reducing your total lifetime duration of obesity, still reduces the risk of developing later diseases.\u201d",

        "body": "Before you read on, a word of caution. There are some films \u2013 many of them \u2013 that impress on a first viewing but which start to trickle away, like a handful of sand, the moment you leave the cinema. Then there are others, far fewer in number, that strike like a lightning bolt on a first watch and stay with you, scarring themselves into your psyche and subtly but permanently shifting your movie-viewing paradigm on its axis. Jonathan Glazer\u2019s masterful and chilling The Zone of Interest fell into the second group for me. I left it shaken and stricken; it stayed with me, stubbornly, over the months that followed. As most film fans will agree, that kind of viscerally intense response to a film is the holy grail of cinema viewing. It\u2019s a vanishingly rare experience, and one that is magnified by the sense of discovery that comes from knowing virtually nothing about a film going in (I knew that it was a loose adaptation of the novel of the same title by Martin Amis, but little else). So with that in mind, to any readers who remain in the privileged position of knowing nothing about The Zone of Interest, consider putting aside this review and watching the film first. Otherwise, read on. To describe The Zone of Interest as an adapted screenplay is perhaps misleading (although it has secured an Oscar nomination in that category, along with four others, including best picture and best director). In fact, the film is very much its own brooding, boldly unconventional entity, sharing with Amis\u2019s book a title and a location \u2013 Auschwitz, or more specifically just outside the walls of the camp, in the home of a high-ranking Nazi and his family \u2013 but little else. The walls are a crucial component of this film, which shows the daily details of the life of an upwardly mobile Nazi couple \u2013 the commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf H\u00f6ss (Christian Friedel), and his wife, Hedwig (Sandra H\u00fcller) \u2013 and their five children. The H\u00f6ss family are raised according to the tenets of the Artaman League, a German anti-urban, back-to-the-land movement that advocated an agrarian ideal and respect for the natural world (Rudolf, a man who presides over the murders of thousands of people each week, dictates an aggrieved memo about the lack of respect for his prized lilacs). They enjoy wholesome, halcyon picnics by the river (predominantly captured, like most of the picture, in dispassionate mid and wide shots) and idyllic days in the lush, lovingly tended garden of the H\u00f6ss villa, a source of considerable pride for Hedwig. We never see beyond the walls that separate her cherished roses and dahlias from the industrial death factory on the other side. But through Johnnie Burn\u2019s incredible, immersive sound design, the ambient noise generated by the horrors within the camp is evoked with a suffocating intensity that matches the choking pall of smoke billowing continuously from the Auschwitz furnace chimneys. Burn\u2019s remarkable work is not the only aural element that contributes to the film\u2019s brutal power. Glazer reteams with composer Mica Levi, his collaborator on his previous film, Under the Skin. Levi\u2019s sparsely used score, accompanying eerie night-vision thermal images, jolts us out of the oblivious banality of the H\u00f6ss household. And their compositions bookend the picture, with what sounds like a chorus of tormented souls. A gnawing sense of dread permeates the entire film, created through sound and score, but also through telling details, such as the way the father\u2019s work has polluted his children\u2019s play (the older boy locks his little brother in a greenhouse and then teases him by making the hissing sound of gas). Imagine the stress levels of the chilling baby-on-the-beach sequence from Under the Skin, but stretched out to feature length. It\u2019s a bruising watch. Unshowy but impeccable in the two main roles, both Friedel and H\u00fcller excel. Friedel plays Rudolf as a pedantic, mid-level bureaucrat with a thin, needling voice and a despot\u2019s haircut, whose unquestioning efficiency and commitment to the cause of National Socialism has facilitated his rapid ascent within the SS. And H\u00fcller\u2019s Hedy chortles over her good fortune as she cherrypicks the choicest possessions of murdered Jewish prisoners, parading her newly elevated status like a purloined mink coat. Nowhere is the understated brilliance of H\u00fcller\u2019s performance better demonstrated than in the delivery of a single line of dialogue, said to her housemaid: \u201cI could have my husband spread your ashes across the fields of Babice.\u201d It could be wielded like a deadly weapon, but H\u00fcller says it conversationally, almost pleasantly. The impact all but knocks the breath from your body.",

        "body": "My son doesn\u2019t talk about school at all, and has become so gymnastically adept at evading our interrogations that we get almost all of our information through other means. Some of this is through official channels, not least the emails the school sends us. I say \u2018us\u2019, but the emails all go to his mum, which is unfortunate. Despite her many other admirable qualities, my wife has a tendency to let these pile up in her inbox, whereupon she sends them to me in clumps of five or six, by which time they may date from any time in the past month. This means we are the last to know if there are forms that need to be filled out, any cake sales on the horizon, or cases of West Nile virus ripping through the student population. Our other main resource is other, better parents, especially those who save our lives on a weekly basis in the parents\u2019 WhatsApp group. When Kingdom comes, there shall be a special place in heaven reserved for all those who write things like, \u2018What size ladder do we have to pack on Friday?\u2019 prompting my wife and I to realise that \u2018Bring a Ladder to School Day\u2019 has come round once more. But our number one resource is a visual cue on my son\u2019s person. I discover almost all information about his school days from the stickers he comes home with. Helpfully, they often come branded with text that makes their source immediately obvious. Even the most passive parent can make sense of bright yellow stickers that blare GOOD READING! or MATHS SUPERSTAR. But even more oblique offerings, like GREAT EFFORT, are rendered scrutable by the other marvellous thing about stickers; while my son cannot be bribed or cajoled into telling us about any part of his day from a simple suite of questions, he is positively enthusiastic to explain any sticker he receives. So it was that we discovered the exact text he\u2019d read to attain his first adhesive appliqu\u00e9, and the precise sums he\u2019d managed to get his second. The \u2018good effort\u2019 to which the third applied, was in making his handwriting extra neat in his copy book. He described this feat to us in full sentences \u2013 a first for any school-related activity \u2013 ending with a glorious flourish of garbled self-praise, \u2018I writed as neat as a pie.\u2019 This week\u2019s sticker was a big, bright-red heart with no text on it whatsoever, which he informed us marked him out as a \u2018fair play champion\u2019. This was, he told me, because he and his friend, Elena, had invited another child into their game in the playground. We rejoiced at his kindness, its reward and, moreover, the window it gave us into his daily life. Now, if only he can come home with a sticker that tells us what size ladder he needs to bring on Friday, we\u2019ll be laughing.

        "body": "A series on the lives, hopes and fears of 24-year-olds around the world in a year of election uncertainty, conflict and climate change. Where do you live and who with? I live in an intergenerational home in Auckland with my mum, my younger sister Ele (21), my cousins Anna (14) and Gabby (7), my grandpa, my partner and our family dog Koko. My grandma, also named Taualofa and our matriarch, lived with us too before she died six months ago. What do you do? Exist, lol. Dream daily about a better world. At the moment I\u2019m resting as I\u2019ve endured a lot of illness mentally and physically this year. I use journalism, writing, community activism and making as a form of service to my communities. I am a core member of a Samoan art collective. What apps do you use? Spotify and Netflix. I\u2019m on a social media break at the moment \u2013 except for TikTok. What do you listen to? I like listening to UK drill, Latin club music, Reggaeton, Afrobeats and 70\u2019s RnB. My mum generously passed on her love of 80\u2019s soft rock and 90\u2019s RnB, which are on heavy rotation for me \u2013 artists like Sade, Prince, Bee Gees, Jodeci and Babyface. My absolute favourite artists to listen to are Samoan and Tongan acoustic bands and choirs from the 70\u2019s. What do you eat? I\u2019m fixated on having fruit smoothies and peanut butter on toast, even for dinner sometimes. I eat mostly chicken, fish, rice and veggies. When I\u2019m feeling crap I\u2019ll probably binge eat Whittaker\u2019s Peanut Butter chocolate. I really enjoy cooking for my family but if I\u2019m exhausted I\u2019ll order Chinese. I think it\u2019s important to support our local economy and creative food businesses, if you are in a position to do so \u2013 my family and I do that on the weekends sometimes. How do you socialise? My socialisation levels are minimal and have been since Covid. I usually catch up with my best friend once or twice a month and we do a mix of making a meal together, playing video games, chilling, smoking cigarettes and drinking or watching a movie. We both have had a very turbulent 20s so far. What do you wear? I dress for my own comfort. A lot of brown and green tones. Grandma-style knit cardigans with cool patterns over long maxi dresses; cargo pants and a plain singlet, gold jewellery \u2013 I\u2019m never without my gold locket. For shoes: chunky sandals or my Doc Martin boots. Basketball shorts, slides, baggy tees. Very relaxed and mostly masculine. Tell us about your Saturday My sister, my partner and I go to a market to buy fresh fruits and veggies for our whole family. We have our music on blast while my partner drives us to south Auckland \u2013 vape smoke in the air, windows down. It\u2019s great, probably the highlight of my week. It\u2019s just us, no adults or kids. We like trying to get as much possible, while spending the least we can \u2013 it\u2019s like a game. We usually get a feed after from one of the small stalls \u2013 dumplings or kebabs \u2013 before making our way back to Central Auckland to a Pak\u2019nSave for our big grocery shop for the week. We usually plan our meals for in advance so we get everything we need. How do you relax? Being with my people gives me energy, which helps me to relax. When I do leave the house and am actually outside, I like to support my friends and Pacific creatives doing cool things \u2013 whether it\u2019s a gig, art show, a festival \u2013 events that bring community together,are judgment free, fun and offer a good time and/or good music. Walking, listening to ASMR, listening to music, making art, going for a swim, watching trashy reality TV also help me relax. I\u2019m such a chronic over-thinker, I\u2019m always overloading my brain and searching for deeper meanings, relationships, and reasons for existing \u2013 so, doing things that don\u2019t require much thought is really beneficial. What do you want? For young people to trust themselves and be courageous, loving and hopeful. For older people to listen, learn, to advocate for us and be bold and radical in their actions. For my loved ones to live without struggle or heaviness \u2013 to live full, joyful lives. For myself to welcome radical love and self acceptance and to practise joy daily. To fill my brain and to remain teachable. To achieve all my creative dreams. What do you fear? More loss as a family. To lose myself, or to witness a loved one lose themselves. What do you want to tell us? I believe in indigenous sovereignty in Aotearoa \u2013 what\u2019s good for M\u0101ori is good for us all and there is no room for racism or colonial projects in our future. I support land returned to Indigenous communities globally and for underserved communities to be treated with respect and compassion and tohave the tools to thrive. I want a fossil fuel free future, and no more deep sea drilling. I hope for a world that welcomes and celebrates our differences. What does the world in 2024 look like to you? We are going to see collective solidarity at its strongest, with young Indigenous and Pacific people showing the world how necessary it is for us to lead with empathy, compassion and radical love and joy. We are going to see more and more folk refusing the tools of colonialism and capitalism and leaning into healing alongside one another. Read more from our 24 in 2024 series.",

        "body": "Homegrown experimentalism reigned supreme at the London Critics\u2019 Circle awards, which gave its top honours to Jonathan Glazer\u2019s radical Holocaust film, The Zone of Interest \u2013 and an equal number to Andrew Haigh\u2019s devastating ghost romance, All of Us Strangers. The Zone of Interest, about the domestic idyll constructed by Hedwig and Rudolph H\u00f6ss next door to Auschwitz, where he was camp commandant, won best picture and best director. Glazer thanked critics, audiences, his colleagues, \u201cand most of all my wife, as it\u2019s all about her at the end of the day anyway\u201d. His producer, James Wilson, said he believed the question posed by the film \u201cboils down\u201d to one of \u201cselective empathy: whether we care more about the health and safety and violence against some innocent people than others. It seems so stark in the world [today] that that is not the case.\u201d Wilson continued by saying he hoped it went without saying that people in \u201cUkraine and south Israel\u201d are \u201cas deserving of empathy as those in Gaza or Yemen or anywhere\u201d. The film also took the technical achievement prize for music and sound, awarded to Mica Levi and Johnnie Burn for their extraordinary soundtrack, which seeks to convey the unseen horrors behind the camp walls. Speaking to the audience, Levi also related the film to the current conflict in the Middle East. \u201cWorking on this film continues to be monumental for me, and is starting to be for my friends,\u201d they said. \u201cThe time we are in can\u2019t be ignored. I wish for a ceasefire \u2013 as I\u2019m sure we all do \u2013 and for some change.\u201d Meanwhile, All of Us Strangers, in which Andrew Scott plays a screenwriter who embarks on a new relationship at the same time reuniting with his long-dead parents, took the Attenborough award for British/Irish film of the year, as well as best actor for Scott. Speaking to the audience, Scott said: \u201cThis is completely wonderful \u2026 it just launched our film in the most extraordinary way, and it\u2019s made a difference.\u201d He nodded to the film\u2019s position at the top of the Irish box office, and it also having made No 1 in the UK, too. \u201cFor a gay love story, it ain\u2019t nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t say those films don\u2019t make money.\u201d He went on to thank his co-stars Claire Foy and Jamie Bell, \u201cmy sexy mum and dad\u201d, and the \u201calso sexy\u201d Paul Mescal, before thanking Haigh for allowing him to be part of a film which has elicited such emotional reactions. \u201cNever in my life have I had such heartfelt, raw responses from audiences.\u201d Scott finished by paying tearful tribute to his own mother and father, \u201cwho I\u2019ve thought about every day\u201d. Accepting the film of the year award, Haigh thanked critics for being \u201cso generous with the film\u201d and \u201cconnecting to it in really personal ways\u201d. Mescal won British/Irish Performer for his body of work in 2023; the actor has also appeared over the past 12 months in God\u2019s Creatures, Foe and Carmen. Thanking the voters for having helped \u201cfilms like [Strangers]\u201d which \u201cneed to be seen\u201d, he singled out Scott and Haigh, saying that working on the film \u201cwas one of the privileges of my life\u201d. While The Zone of Interest is in contention for five Oscars next month, All of Us Strangers was not nominated in a single category. And while both films are up for Baftas, All of Us Strangers\u2019 six nominations do not include a nod for Scott \u2013 an omission which met with considerable backlash. Meanwhile, best actress went to Emma Stone for Poor Things, consolidating her narrow lead over Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019s Lily Gladstone in the Oscars\u2019 race. Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph won best supporting actress for The Holdovers, repeating the win she has so far managed in every awards ceremony so far this season. However, there was a surprise in the supporting actor category, which went to Charles Melton for May December. The sweep of honours for Glazer and Haigh\u2019s films meant Oppenheimer \u2013 hotly tipped to sweep the Oscars \u2013 went home without a single award, as did Barbie and Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon. Justine Triet and Arthur Harari took the screenwriting award for Anatomy of a Fall, while Mstyslav Chernov accepted the documentary prize for 20 Days in Mariupol. Speaking to the crowd, Chernov said he believed \u201ccinema has the power to change history and how people will see our time, and maybe make better choices\u201d. Both The Zone of Interest and Anatomy of a Fall lost out to Celine Song\u2019s Past Lives for foreign-language film of the year, while Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s The Boy and the Heron won the animated film prize. Oscar-nominated Jeffrey Wright was presented with the Dilys Powell Award for Excellence in Film by his American Fiction director Cord Jefferson. Meanwhile, Wright\u2019s rival Colman Domingo took the inaugural Derek Malcolm Award for Innovation, named for the late Guardian film critic. How to Have Sex won two awards: international breakthrough performance for Mia McKenna-Bruce and Philip French Award for British/Irish breakthrough film-maker for writer/director Molly Manning Walker. Other winners included Lola Campbell, who won young performer for Scrapper, and Natalie Cubides-Brady, director of short film The Veiled City. The London Critics\u2019 Circle is the UK\u2019s longest-standing critics\u2019 organisation, with 210 members. It is one of the last remaining awards ceremonies before the Baftas in a fortnight. These are followed, three weeks later on 10 March, by this year\u2019s Oscars.",

        "body": "One party claimed \u201cpermanent traumatic brain injury, four broken ribs [and] loss of enjoyment of life\u201d. The other \u201clost half a day of skiing\u201d. Now the unconscious coupling of Gwyneth Paltrow and Terry Sanderson, who collided on a ski slope and faced off last year in a notorious trial, slaloms on to the stage. That should not be taken to suggest that Linus Karp and Joseph Martin \u2013 AKA Awkward Productions \u2013 have identified beneath all the privilege, idiocy and razzmatazz any wider implications or deeper dramatic currents. They have not. They\u2019re here for the idiocy and razzmatazz, and so, dear viewer, must you be. Karp himself, fresh from performing as Princess Di in Diana: The Untold and Untrue Story, stars as Paltrow: serene, superior, and \u2013 Karp being Swedish \u2013 sing-song Scandinavian. Martin is the septuagenarian optometrist who ploughs into her \u2013 or was it vice versa? \u2013 on the piste. The show has them meeting in the Deer Valley, Utah resort before the accident in question, ramping up the contrast between Sanderson\u2019s \u201csad\u201d life and Gwyneth\u2019s glamorous one. It ramps up everything else, too: this is a camp cartoon, delighted by the affair\u2019s every instance of shallowness, star-worship and bad faith. That can be fun. The show is packed with jokes, if often the obvious ones (\u201cI married Coldplay singer, and the colour beige personified, Chris Martin \u2026\u201d), and cheerfully unabashed by its basement-level production values. It co-opts the crowd to play supporting roles, including Paltrow\u2019s husband-to-be and Sanderson\u2019s girlfriend. (His lawyer is played by a muppet.) It shares with its audience a gossipy delight in the trial\u2019s more outre episodes (\u201cShe really did ask her that!\u201d) I\u2019m not sure those limited pleasures sustain for the two-hour duration. There\u2019s plenty that\u2019s extraneous, not least Gwyneth\u2019s encounters with the (cardboard) \u201cdeer of Deer Valley\u201d and its woodland pals. I felt a bit cheated that most of the songs are lip-synced rather than sung, for no clear reason. But Martin and Karp\u2019s commitment to the undertaking, and the latter\u2019s raised-eyebrow charisma, ensure that \u2013 unlike its protagonists \u2013 this arch courtroom drama / winter sports mashup avoids wipeout. At Pleasance theatre, London, until 16 February",

        "body": "President Joe Biden won his first official primary election in a season that has become increasingly predictable with each contest. Biden and the Democratic National Committee had successfully lobbied to thwart tradition and designate South Carolina the first contest for the party\u2019s presidential nomination instead of Iowa and New Hampshire. On Saturday, Biden handily won more than 95% of the vote in the state that had launched his campaign in 2020. The long-shot candidates Dean Phillips, a congressman from Minnesota, and Marianne Williamson, a self-help author, trailed far behind. In two weeks, Donald Trump is expected to capture the win in the Republican primary in the same state, which Biden directly addressed in his statement soon after his victory was confirmed. \u201cIn 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the presidency,\u201d he said. \u201cNow in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the presidency again \u2013 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2013 again.\u201d While Biden\u2019s victory was a foregone conclusion in the state, voter turnout served as a proxy for enthusiasm about his candidacy, especially among the significant Black voting population. Leading up to the primary, there had been some signals he has lost traction among Black voters since 2020: his approval rating among Black adults is 42% in the latest Associated Press-Norc Center for Public Affairs Research poll, a substantial drop from the first year of his presidency. In South Carolina, the results were mixed. Democrats touted early voting numbers: \u201cWith results still coming in, Black voters made up approximately 76% of the early vote \u2013 a significant increase over 2020, where Black voters made up 56% of the primary electorate,\u201d said Michael Tyler, the Biden-Harris campaign\u2019s communications director. But overall voter turnout was on track to be much lower than previous primary years, indicating that even the high stakes of a Biden-Trump rematch might not be enough to mobilize voters for the incumbent. The campaign is hoping that the recent strong economic indicators will bolster Biden\u2019s low approval rating, fueled by voter hesitations about his handling of the Israel-Gaza war, immigration and other domestic issues. But the Phillips campaign, which had just upwards of 2,000 votes, tried to capitalize on the turnout issue anyway. \u201cI congratulate the President for getting the most votes tonight. But the lack of voter enthusiasm for a Trump-Biden rematch is being reflected in each and every Democratic primary result this election,\u201d Phillips said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cVoters are disappointed that they lack options beyond the choice between a threat to the fabric of the nation and a good man who voters want to pass the baton.\u201d While the national picture has yet to play out more fully, poll workers and state Democrats celebrated a successful election process, and South Carolina\u2019s new status, on Saturday. Sam Skardon, chairman of the Charleston county Democratic party, said he was happy volunteers and voters came \u201cto gather and celebrate being first in the nation and all the work that everyone has put in it\u201d. \u201cEveryone here volunteered long and hard to make this primary successful and to keep us in the top of the Democratic election cycle for years to come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means a lot for our party. It means a lot for our state. So thank you all so much.\u201d Jaime Harrison, chair of the DNC and himself a Black South Carolinian, spoke with reporters in Columbia on Saturday night and touted the state\u2019s new significance on Saturday: \u201cFor South Carolina to go first is now a badge of honour and pride for so many folks,\u201d he said.",

        "body": "Psychological scarring from acne can endure long after the lesions themselves. Often there\u2019s a residual fear that the spots might come back, which makes habits such as covering skin with makeup tough to break. My advice is to step down in stages. You could add a little moisturiser to your usual foundation, thinning it out to make a DIY tinted moisturiser. Better still is a BB cream \u2013 a combination of skincare, sun protection and a little pigment for light coverage. BB creams also tend to have more skin-priming ingredients than tinted moisturisers, so they generally last longer on the skin and have a slight \u201cblurring\u201d effect, too. We all deserve to feel confident in our own skin, but having been conditioned to aspire to look perfectly airbrushed, it can be tough to fully embrace it. If you\u2019re feeling brave, you could try a \u201cstep away day\u201d and ditch makeup entirely for one day. This is a reminder that we deserve to be who we are, and that anything we wear is merely an accoutrement. You might find it hard at first, but even trying this once a month could help reduce your anxiety about being in public with bare skin.

        "body": "1. Keep checking the iPlayer, ITVX, etc For smart TV and laptop watchers, arguably the first port of call should be the main on-demand services such as BBC iPlayer, ITVX, Channel 4 (formerly known as All 4), My5 and STV Player. Films sometimes come and go quite quickly, so it\u2019s worth getting into the habit of checking regularly. At the time of writing, the iPlayer was offering Oscar winners The Theory of Everything, the Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga version of A Star Is Born, and Sound of Metal. From 1 March, ITVX is showcasing a selection of Oscar-winning and nominated films, including No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, Drive and Dogtooth (the latter an early film by the Poor Things director, Yorgos Lanthimos), plus all-time classics such as The Apartment, Vertigo and Rear Window. These services typically require you to register and sign in to use them. And, of course, with all the above bar the iPlayer, there are adverts during the films, unless you opt to pay and see fewer ads or go ad-free. 2. Find new channels Scroll through your TV\u2019s main menu and you will probably find channels you have never watched or even heard of. For example, Amazon Freevee is a free, ad-supported streaming service boasting thousands of shows and movies, including A Dangerous Method, starring Keira Knightley, and Darren Aronofsky\u2019s acclaimed drama Requiem for a Dream. Plex is a free-with-ads service with an excellent range of old and new movies. It boasts a particularly good selection of foreign, arthouse and midnight movie gems, including Japanese classics by Akira Kurosawa, Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi, several movies by the Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, and a stack of Bollywood films. Other channels include the vintage movie specialist Talking Pictures TV, Great! Movies, LEGEND, Rakuten TV, Pluto TV and wedotv. How and where to watch these services will vary, depending on your kit and your preference \u2013 it might be via Freeview, Sky or Virgin Media, or via an app on your TV or device, or via another platform. In most cases there is a website that spells this out. 3. Use free trials Many of the streaming services offer free trials, so you could sign up, watch a lot of films and then cancel before you are rolled over into a paid-for subscription (read the terms and conditions very carefully to make sure you are not caught out). Apple TV+ is running a free seven-day trial, giving you the chance to watch Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon, which has been nominated for 10 Oscars. Its other movies include the 2021 film Coda, winner of three Oscars including Best Picture. Amazon Prime has a 30-day free trial, allowing you to check out new movies such as Saltburn and Foe, a sci-fi drama starring Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan. Students can get six months\u2019 free membership when signing up to Prime Student. Other services offering seven-day free trials include Paramount+ (its movies include the Tom Cruise blockbuster Top Gun: Maverick and Babylon, starring Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie), Lionsgate+, StudioCanal Presents, MGM, and four that are particularly good for arthouse fare and classics: BFI Player, Curzon, Mubi and the eastern Europe specialist Klassiki. Netflix does not currently offer free trials. 4. Beware of illegal sites \u201cBe careful when you search online \u2013 many websites will send you to dubious destinations that not only stream illegal content but also slam you with spammy warnings and pop-up windows,\u201d says Or Goren at the website Cord Busters. He says that in general, if it looks too good to be true \u2013 for example, the most recent Hollywood hits being offered \u201cfor free\u201d \u2013 then \u201cthere\u2019s something fishy\u201d. Last autumn Guardian Money highlighted how people in the UK who illegally stream movies, sport and TV shows online were being warned they risked having their bank accounts emptied or their identities stolen. The BeStreamWise campaign also points out that people who watch pirated content can potentially be prosecuted. 5. Scan listings If you want to watch films for free on the big screen, event listings websites can help. For example, Eventbrite lists free screenings around the country, which often take place at libraries and community spaces. In north London, Wood Green library is showing Citizen Kane on 15 February, The Book Thief on 22 February and Vertigo on 29 February, while Laxton Victory Hall in Laxton, East Yorkshire, has a \u201cromcom movie night\u201d (film TBC) on 23 FebruaryThe Plaza cinema in the Liverpool suburb of Waterloo also runs community screenings, with the next ones scheduled for 6 February and 5 March. Museums and galleries sometimes host free film screenings. BFI Southbank in London has the Mediatheque, where you can explore the riches of the British Film Institute\u2019s national archive for free, including classics such as Brief Encounter and Withnail and I. Some cinemas organise free screenings for certain groups. For example, BFI Southbank has screenings that are free for the over-60s. The next ones are the Oscar-nominated 2016 romantic drama Loving on 5 February and the 1992 drama Blue Black Permanent on 1 March. 6. Join a club A number of services discreetly offer free and cheap tickets to movies and other events, often at short notice \u2013 it\u2019s typically about filling empty seats and building a buzz. One of the best for movies is ShowFilmFirst, which occasionally offers free tickets to previews, director Q&amp;As and so on (you have to apply to be a member, and it will let you know if you\u2019ve been successful). Also check out Free Movies UK (FMUK), a non-profit, free-membership organisation and web forum dedicated to getting its members \u201cas many free cinema tickets [typically provided by film distributors] as possible\u201d. 7. More freebies on the way A new BFI-supported multi-year project called Escapes will offer free film screenings in cinemas to almost 1 million people across the UK. Beginning in early 2024, Escapes will offer regular free screenings at up to 400 cinemas and aim \u201cto grow cinema engagement across the UK and break down primary barriers to cinema-going among audiences, particularly those excluded by price\u201d. More details should emerge soon \u2013 keep an eye on the website, escapetothecinema.co.uk.",

        "body": "The energy and climate minister Graham Stuart asked BP about the incentives required to \u201cmaximise\u201d extraction of oil and gas from the North Sea, documents released under freedom of information rules have revealed. Stuart\u2019s meeting with the corporation\u2019s UK boss, Louise Kingham, last year came days after BP had announced a record profit of $28bn (\u00a323bn) for 2022, raised its dividend to shareholders, and rowed back on its aim to cut its carbon emissions by 2030. Households were also enduring very high energy bills. BP will report its profits for 2023 on Tuesday. Stuart also asked for advice from Kingham about winning the argument that UK oil production was \u201cgood\u201d and part of the net zero transition. Experts have repeatedly refuted arguments that new oil and gas production can increase UK energy security or lower prices. The UK\u2019s oil and gas body granted 24 new drilling licences to BP and other companies last Wednesday, following 27 licences in October and with more to follow in the coming months. The chair of the UK\u2019s official climate advisers said in January that \u201cfurther licensing [is] inconsistent with climate goals\u201d. The International Energy Agency said in 2021 that any new fossil fuel developments were incompatible with reaching net zero emissions by 2050. \u201cDrilling for new North Sea oil will undermine the UK\u2019s climate commitments and won\u2019t ensure energy security, yet the minister cynically sought BP\u2019s help to try and \u2018win\u2019 the opposite argument,\u201d said Chris Garrard, of the campaigns and research organisation Culture Unstained, which made the FoI request. \u201cWhat\u2019s more disturbing though, is that days after BP had announced record profits, he seems to assure BP that there are incentives and money to keep its polluting fossil fuels flowing, all while the public struggled to pay their energy bills,\u201d he said. The documents released include a heavily redacted readout of a meeting between Stuart and Kingham on 17 February 2023. Stuart asked: \u201cWhere do you think we are in terms of having the right incentives in place to maximise recovery from [the] North Sea and keep making the case to win the argument why producing it in the UK is good, and is part of the net zero transition, to make sure we minimise our imports?\u201d He said: \u201cThe money is there, making incentives and structures to allow it to flow.\u201d Stuart also asked Kingham for information to use in making the argument for new North Sea production: \u201cWe will be using oil and gas and, if we don\u2019t do it ourselves, we will be spending that money elsewhere. Adding that up I would like a number saying do we really want to spend x billions relying on foreign imports.\u201d Large sections of Kingham\u2019s responses are redacted, with government officials citing \u201ccommercially confidential information\u201d. But she said: \u201cIdeologically, you need to think where to do tax or incentives, because you won\u2019t get the investment.\u201d She also said BP was \u201cproud of [its] work and the jobs it creates and ever cleaner barrels\u201d, adding that the argument would be \u201camplified by some social media and ads\u201d. Tessa Khan, at the campaign group Uplift, said: \u201cBP\u2019s got a nerve telling our government that the industry needs more tax breaks and subsidies or they won\u2019t invest, in the middle of a cost of living crisis driven by energy bills and when it\u2019s just announced $28bn in profit.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s really egregious, though, is the minister responding that \u2018the money is there\u2019 for profiteering oil giants at the same time as it\u2019s just cut off vital support to millions of households who literally can\u2019t afford to heat their homes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question at all about whose side this government is on.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cMinister Stuart is absolutely right to be backing domestic oil and gas, as the UK will still be using oil and gas even when we reach net zero in 2050. It is good for our energy security, supports up to 200,000 jobs and has brought in \u00a3400bn in tax revenue to date [over the past 50 years] which has been used to help families with the cost of living and fund public services. The \u00a36bn raised by our energy profits levy on oil and gas producers alone helped us pay around half a typical household\u2019s energy bill last winter.\u201d \u201cMinisters will continue to meet with energy companies to encourage investment into the UK and end reliance on costly foreign imports of liquefied natural gas with higher emissions,\u201d she said. A spokesperson for BP said: \u201cBP is a major UK-headquartered company with plans to invest significantly in the UK\u2019s energy systems and transition. As such, we have regular meetings with government departments. This discussion focused on how the UK could continue to attract investment and maintain pace after the US Inflation Reduction Act in both today\u2019s oil and gas system and in renewable and low carbon projects.\u201d The act supports renewable energy. Fossil fuel companies have received \u00a380bn in UK government support since 2015. Most of the 24 new drilling licences were granted to foreign companies. On Friday it was revealed that an oil and gas company owned by a major Tory donor, which had previously been fined for illegal flaring, was awarded one of the drilling licences. In January, the former Conservative energy minister Chris Skidmore resigned as an MP in protest at the party\u2019s dash for oil and gas, calling the policy a \u201ctragedy\u201d that is \u201cwrong and will cause future harm\u201d.",

        "body": "Bruce Willis\u2019 wife Emma Heming Willis is set to publish a book about her experience as a caregiver to her husband after he was disagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. The untitled book, which will be published in 2025 by Maria Shriver\u2019s publishing imprint the Open Field, will \u201coffer a thoughtful, inspiring guide for those seeking support while navigating a loved one\u2019s dementia.\u201d \u201cFor many people, their first touch point about this disease is received in their doctor\u2019s office,\u201d Heming Willis said in an interview with Shriver\u2019s newsletter the Sunday Paper. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important how this information from doctor to patient and loved one is relayed. Having resources and information readily available is imperative. I know between my experience and other care partners that I have spoken to; our stories are unfortunately similar. We left that office with close to no resources or support and with a diagnosis that I could hardly pronounce.\u201d Willis\u2019 condition was first made public in March 2022, when his family announced he would be retiring from acting due to aphasia, a disorder that causes difficulty with language or speech. A year later, it was announced that he had been formally diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Symptoms of FTD include emotional problems, trouble communicating, struggles with walking and difficulty working, according to the National Institute on Aging. When his diagnosis was made public, actors and directors who worked with Willis revealed they had been quietly voicing their concerns about his cognitive state for years, as he struggled to remember dialogue, needed lines rewritten to be shorter, expressed confusion at his surroundings and required shortened work days. The Razzie awards, which recognise the worst films and performances and had created a prize just for Willis\u2019 many appearances in films in 2021, withdrew the category after his condition was revealed. In September, Heming Willis revealed she had become Willis main caregiver and said it was \u201chard to know\u201d if the 68-year-old actor fully understood his diagnosis. On Monday, Heming Willis told the Sunday Paper that she has \u201cso much more hope today than I did after Bruce was first diagnosed. I understand this disease more now, and I\u2019m now connected to an incredible community of support. I have hope in having found a new purpose \u2013 admittedly one I never would have gone looking for \u2013 using the spotlight to help and empower others.\u201d She said she hoped her book would help \u201ccare partners, but especially new care partners, who have just received this life-changing news \u2026 they should know they are not alone and there is support, even hope. In a perfect world, I envision this book in that doctor\u2019s office, and he or she, puts it in their hands to bring home.\u201d Heming Willis and Willis married in 2009 and have two daughters together.",

        "body": "Manufacturers of new smart TVs will have to prominently display Australian TV channels to ensure local networks are not crowded out by streamers, under draft legislation released by the Labor government. The so-called prominence legislation has been designed to guarantee local, free-to-air TV services Seven, Nine, Ten, SBS and the ABC are easy for Australian audiences to find on smart TVs. This will ensure the dissemination of local news and emergency information as well as supporting the local creative and communications industries. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup If passed, the law would oblige device manufacturers to include a number of features to reduce the risk of free-to-air broadcasting services being crowded out by the likes of Netflix and Disney+. The minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, revealed the regulations would mean new devices would need to provide access to free-to-air networks, pre-install their video-on-demand apps \u2013 such as iview and 10Play \u2013 and present separate tiles, tabs or links to provide easy access to each service. However, the requirements will not apply retrospectively to existing television sets, and the legislation does not include features sought by the free-to-air industry such as search functions that prioritise free-to-air networks over the streamers. Rowland said the reforms would help ensure free local services remain easily accessible to Australian audiences on their connected television devices, even as technology changes. \u201cLocal, free-to-air television informs and entertains all Australians, contributing to our shared sense of identity and cultural life,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cThe Albanese government\u2019s new prominence framework delivers on our election commitment to modernise media laws and level the playing field, recognising the important role that free-to-air broadcasters continue to play for Australians \u2013 no matter where they live or what they earn.\u201d Last year Astra, the subscription media industry\u2019s lobby group, campaigned against the changes, including through a series of full-page newspaper advertisements that declared: \u201cNow the government wants to control your TV.\u201d Bridget Fair, the chief executive officer of Free TV Australia, said Astra\u2019s campaign was \u201chighly misleading\u201d. Astra advocates on behalf of the likes of Foxtel, Binge, Disney+ and the Australian Christian Channel. Ramon Lobato, an associate professor from RMIT\u2019s school of media and communication, told the Guardian last year that prominence is an existential challenge for Australian public service broadcasters, which do not have the resources to pay market rates for visibility in smart TV interfaces. \u201cThe smart TV testing we\u2019ve done at RMIT suggests that local broadcaster apps are substantially less visible, less frequently preinstalled, and less discoverable through search and recommendations than the major US services \u2013 Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video and Disney+,\u201d he said. Australia is one of several countries going down this legislative pathway. In the UK the bill ensures BBC iPlayer, ITVX, Channel 4 and My5 are easy to find on smart TVs. Foxtel, which is 65% owned by News Corp, is opposed to the legislation, arguing it restricts consumer choice and could distort the market in favour of broadcasters. On 21 February Foxtel will launch its own smart TV technology called Hubbl \u2013 pitched as the \u201cworld\u2019s best user interface\u201d \u2013 which will integrate paid and free TV services in one device. The bill has been referred to a Senate committee for inquiry and report by 26 March 2024.",

        "body": "It\u2019s a quiet morning at London gallery Studio Voltaire and Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley is challenging me to a trial run of her latest artwork. It\u2019s a horror-inspired video game in which players fight to overcome the problems that are holding them back, from fear of failure to addiction. It\u2019s also the centrepiece of her first institutional solo show, which takes on the theme of transformation. I grapple with the game but, by my fourth round, I\u2019m still no good; synthetic screams echo around the empty gallery. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be super hard!\u201d laughs Brathwaite-Shirley. \u201cIt\u2019s all based on things that I\u2019m trying to overcome or have overcome. It didn\u2019t take one turn, it took many.\u201d The Rebirthing Room is the latest of Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s participatory works. The idea came to her after a conversation with a curator about the usefulness of art galleries. \u201cWe were talking about the ways we could use a space to do something more. Rather than just showing a piece, what can it do?\u201d she says. \u201cThen I thought: it would be amazing if you came to a gallery and left as a different person.\u201d The 29-year-old began making interactive art in 2020 after a misguided comment from a visitor left her questioning her work\u2019s purpose. At the time, her portfolio consisted of videos and animations that documented the London burlesque scene she was involved with, as well as her Black transgender peers. Presented in what she describes as a \u201cbeautiful, retro-aesthetic\u201d style, it created alternative realities for members of her community \u2013 an unconventional approach to archiving to remedy the blind spots in historical records. \u201cSomeone said to me: I really like your work because I can bathe in the visuals and ignore what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Brathwaite-Shirley recalls. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s the best feedback I\u2019ve ever had in my life \u2026 because I cannot do that any more!\u201d From then on, she started incorporating choices for audience members to make in order to progress through the work. In 2022, she presented Get Home Safe, an arcade-style game inspired by her own experiences of walking around Berlin at night, where players are tasked with guiding the protagonist through dark streets safely. Meanwhile, last year\u2019s browser-based I Can\u2019t Follow You Anymore asks the audience to navigate a revolution and decide who will be saved or sacrificed. \u201cIn interactive work, you have to put effort in to see anything at all,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the choices people make and the feeling they leave with that I\u2019m fascinated with. I think that\u2019s when the real artwork begins to happen.\u201d Keen to prioritise content over aesthetics, Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s new work draws on the rudimentary pre-rendered graphics of early computer games. It\u2019s deliberately lo-fi, built from 2D animations, iPad drawings and outdated software, with a VHS-style finish. The grass in the on-screen forest is made from edited photographs of her hands, while the sounds are developed from recordings of herself screaming into her phone \u2013 an extension of her archival project. \u201cI never want to get to this super high-glossy thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI like to make people\u2019s brains work a little bit more.\u201d Complete with disorienting sound effects and low lighting, the Rebirthing Room is a fully immersive experience. Surrounding the screens and the handbuilt, audience-operated controller are huge trees draped in fabric and rows of real corn \u2013 a reference to the horror movies she grew up watching. \u201cThe thing I like about horror is that it makes you want to go through experiences and feelings that you would never want to on a typical day,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the film\u2019s really good, something about it keeps you there. It\u2019s a really nice balance of it being super scary but intriguing enough to keep you with it.\u201d Beyond being a nifty device to \u201ctrick\u201d viewers into reckoning with their own values and beliefs, Brathwaite-Shirley\u2019s digital universes filled with demons, villains and gore feel appropriate for the current climate. As well as the hostility from outsider groups, it\u2019s also important to highlight all the \u201cmessy nuances\u201d that exist within one\u2019s own, she says: \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re in such a censored time, [where] even speaking about a view that your particular political group agrees with feels dangerous because it feels like you have to say it in the way that they want to hear it. And so for me, presenting a utopia in the settings we\u2019re currently in is very, very much useless.\u201d Challenging the audience is something she wants to see more of in the art world, which she feels too often favours pleasant, Instagram-friendly experiences. It\u2019s not her aim to make people enjoy her work; she finds a more visceral, emotional reaction more interesting. She tells me that if she leaves a show with only compliments, she feels that her work has done nothing. She\u2019s curious about how the audience will respond to the Rebirthing Room. Will they play until they succeed? Or will they, like me, give up? Only time will tell. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to see how I can push it further next time,\u201d she says. \u2022 Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley: The Rebirthing Room is at Studio Voltaire, London, until 28 April 2024",

One is a backstage comedy, set in the West End in 1800, about the personal and professional life of celebrated actor Sarah Siddons. The Divine Mrs S, which will run at Hampstead theatre from next month, is written by April De Angelis who has had more than 30 plays staged over her career. The other, which opens at the Yard theatre this week, is a debut by Rhianna Ilube. Set in Ghana in 2019, it explores colonialism\u2019s impact on British identity and has the eye-catching title Samuel Takes a Break \u2026 in Male Dungeon No 5 After a Long But Generally Successful Day of Tours. There are eight other plays on the shortlist for the award, chosen from more than 200 submissions. Two of the finalists have already been staged in London. A Woman Walks Into a Bank, Roxy Cook\u2019s tragicomedy about Russia, which features a talking cat, ran at Theatre503 last year. Jasmine Naziha Jones\u2019s Baghdaddy uses clowning to explore global conflict and was performed at the Royal Court in 2022 with its playwright among the cast. Ava Pickett\u2019s play 1536, meanwhile, was submitted to the prize by the Almeida theatre who commissioned it as part of their Genesis Programme. It received a special mention at the 2023 George Devine award for its \u201cinventiveness, playfulness and savage undercurrent\u201d. The other five finalists are North American. The Dowagers is by Justice Hehir, a playwright and doula whose work explores sexuality and resilience. Hannah Moscovitch\u2019s Red Like Fruit examines trauma and consent after #MeToo. K-I-S-S-I-N-G by poet and playwright Lenelle Mo\u00efse is a romantic comedy. a.k. payne\u2019s Love I Awethu Further is a tale of revolt in the antebellum south and was inspired by Julius Caesar. Chinese Republicans is a comedy by Alex Lin who says her work is \u201cpowered by a drive to bridge the gap between the science and entertainment industries\u201d. The winner of the prize, which has run since 1978, will be announced on 11 March and will be awarded $25,000 (\u00a319,900) and a signed print by Willem de Kooning. Last year, the prize was won by US playwright Sarah Mantell for In the Amazon Warehouse Parking Lot, a play about \u201cqueer ageing, capitalism, campfires and falling in love as the world ends\u201d. Mantell is on this year\u2019s judging panel, alongside poet-playwright Inua Ellams, the actors April Matthis and Clare Perkins, and the directors Eric Ting and Lyndsey Turner.",

        "body": "Austerity cuts to the NHS, public health and social care in England have been linked with a sharp increase in frailty, in the first study of its kind. The coalition government\u2019s austerity programme in the early 2010s is associated with steeper increases in frailty with age compared with the pre-austerity years between 2002 and 2010, the study led by the University of Edinburgh shows. The findings were published in the journal Plos One. More people living with frailty means that relatively minor health problems, such as urinary tract infections, are likely to have a greater effect on the population\u2019s long-term health and wellbeing. Frailty is generally characterised by issues such as reduced muscle strength and fatigue. Previous research had found that a slowdown in improvements in life expectancy coincided with the government\u2019s sharp cuts to health and social care funding after David Cameron came to power more than a decade ago. However, the mechanism through which drastic cuts were associated with decreased life expectancy had been unclear until now. In the new study, researchers analysed data on the frailty index, which captures age-related declines in functional ability and physical and mental health. The analysis included more than 16,000 people enrolled in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 2002-2018, with an average age of 67. Researchers found that frailty index scores increased more rapidly with age after the implementation of austerity policies. This was the case for all population groups, across genders and socioeconomic groups, but was particularly so for the oldest people in England. \u201cCompared to the 2000s, we found that older people in England were becoming more frail, more quickly during the 2010s, and that frailty was particularly common in the poorest in society,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cOur work is another warning about the possible impacts of austerity on the health of an ageing nation.\u201d Prof Adam Gordon, the president of the British Geriatrics Society, said the findings showed how the number of people living with frailty had increased sharply since austerity began. \u201cAs frontline healthcare professionals, we see every day how social isolation, the inability to get out, to exercise and to eat well, impact upon health and wellbeing of older people,\u201d he said. \u201cOlder people with frailty are more likely to need the help of health and social care services. In emergency departments, those over the age of 80 have seen their average wait times double, more than for any other age group.\u201d People living with frailty also face the longest waiting lists for elective surgery, and for care in the community, Gordon said. \u201cBesides the suffering experienced by those involved, this is an example of how austerity can end up costing the nation more in the longer term.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are desperately failing our parents and grandparents and this should be a source of national embarrassment. In this election year, it\u2019s essential that all major political parties have clear strategies for investment care and support services, not just for older people who already live with frailty, but for those at risk of developing it in the near future.\u201d Caroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s charity director, said frailty was often the all too visible yet frequently neglected feature of older people\u2019s health. \u201cCharacterised by vulnerability to sudden changes and deterioration in health, frailty is often in the background of pressures across the NHS as older people are made to reach crisis point before getting any help,\u201d she said. \u201cThis includes needing emergency care, and avoidable stays in hospital for want of a decent package of social care or proactive support in the community. \u201cIt is not surprising that when fewer services are available to the public, more older people experience frailty that could have been managed or even avoided. We\u2019ve seen this again with the impact of the pandemic and cost of living crisis that have left older people without the services and support to stay well.\u201d Abrahams said frailty was avoidable and with the right support the condition could be improved or at the very least remain stable. \u201cResponding to that reality is critical for the future success of both NHS and social care and for the wellbeing of our older and ageing population,\u201d she said. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cFourteen years of the Conservatives hollowing out our public services has left our country weaker and less healthy. People\u2019s lives have been cut short and what should be their golden years are increasingly spent in pain and discomfort.\u201d The government said it was providing the NHS and social care with \u00a314.1bn this year and next to improve care for patients across the country. \u201cWe are committed to improving healthy life expectancy by five years by 2035 and reducing regional disparities by 2030 to help people live longer, healthier lives,\u201d a spokesperson added.",

        "body": "This has been a banner year for the sex scene. Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal in All of Us Strangers. Barry Keoghan and a freshly dug grave in Saltburn. Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh and the Bhagavad-Gita in Oppenheimer. Emma Stone and the rest of the cast in Poor Things. Between them, these films have pushed the boundaries of what a cinematic sex scene can be. They\u2019ve been tender, sad, passionate, thought-provoking, gruesome and excruciating in equal measure. But try telling that to Henry Cavill. \u201cI don\u2019t understand them \u2013 I\u2019m not a fan,\u201d Cavill recently said of sex scenes during an interview on Josh Horowitz\u2019s Happy Sad Confused podcast. \u201cI think there are circumstances where a sex scene actually is beneficial to a movie, rather than just the audience, but I think sometimes they\u2019re overused these days.\u201d Which is all very sweet, in that this is the sort of thing your nan would say. But then again the subject did put Cavill in something of a bind. On one hand, maybe he really does mentally switch off from whatever he\u2019s watching during a sex scene, the way that most people do whenever there\u2019s a song in a musical. But, really, what\u2019s the alternative open to him? Going \u201cCOR YEAH I LOVE BOOBS, ME!\u201d? That\u2019s hardly a very edifying thing to hear from Superman, is it? Cavill continued: \u201cSex scenes can be great in a movie and can really help with the storytelling, but most of the time the human imagination is going to trump it. So, it can be a little bit of a cop-out if a TV show or a movie is just filled with gyrating bodies and you\u2019re going, \u2018OK but what is this doing for us apart from the idea of, oh naked person, great\u2019.\u201d From this we can assume two things. The first is that Henry Cavill is not a fan of the television programme Euphoria, the whole point of which is \u201cOh, naked person, great\u201d. The second is that maybe Henry Cavill is really just talking about himself here. Especially in his early years, Cavill starred in several \u201cOh, naked person, great\u201d sex scenes. His first film Laguna is full of narratively superfluous sex scenes, plus it\u2019s also important to remember that he was in The Tudors, which was less a television series and more just a lot of outrageous and barely justified bonking stitched together with the loosest semblance of historical storytelling. Perhaps if you\u2019d spent years of your life joylessly humping away at a colleague in the knowledge that your tender moment of vulnerability would be forever preserved on the internet devoid of all context, you wouldn\u2019t be keen on the idea either. Also it\u2019s worth pointing out that, overall, Cavill is wrong. A 2019 study revealed that only 1.21% of movies made in the 2010s contained nudity, lower than any decade since the 1960s. There are many possible reasons for this. As I just mentioned, fear of ending up naked on a Mr Skin gallery for all eternity might put some actors off. Also, now that the film industry is almost totally reliant on four-quadrant tent-pole blockbusters, there are fewer opportunities to make the sort of sexy mid-budget adult drama that made up a vital chunk of the movie ecosystem in the 1990s. Plus the appetite simply isn\u2019t there any more. In October, research was released indicating that Gen Z is actively turned off by onscreen sex, with almost half of respondents (aged between 13 and 24) saying that sex was not a necessary plot device, and that movies should place more focus on platonic friendships. Also, you know, the internet exists now. There\u2019s such a low barrier to seeing filmed nudity online that it almost seems redundant to put it in an actual film. And yet, done well, there\u2019s still something bracing about movie sex. Especially now, where prestige film-makers seem to be rolling their sleeves up and digging in with more gusto than in recent memory. Viewed in a cluster, Poor Things, Saltburn, All of Us Strangers and Saltburn almost seem like a weird post-Covid celebration. We all spent such a big portion of our lives covered and sterile and distant that there\u2019s something quite joyous about the sight of naked bodies being flung together with total abandon. You know something must be in the air when a figure as musty as Christopher Nolan decides to make his actors whip their clothes off and grind away before the entire United States Atomic Energy Commission. So maybe Henry Cavill just hasn\u2019t worked with the right director yet. Perhaps with the proper encouragement, and a good script, and a decent amount of Oscar buzz, he will finally soften his attitude towards onscreen sex. Maybe one day he\u2019ll even be as cool with it as he is with killing loads and loads of people in films, which he does seem to be perfectly fine with.",

        "body": "Every year there is a two-week period when I become a superstitious Chinese person. I am Chinese year-round but my belief in superstitions ramps up around lunar new year. It is irrational, I know, to believe that I \u2013 a regular person with no magical powers \u2013 can control how much good luck or bad luck I receive, by doing things like not washing my hair or sweeping at particular times. And yet. Am I living with such an abundance of luck right now that I want to risk washing or sweeping it all away? No, which is why I won\u2019t do these things on the first day of the lunar year (that\u2019s this Saturday, in case you feel similarly). Also, bonus: clean hair and a clean home to start the year. Is this \u2026 self-care? A lot of Chinese new year superstitions require no effort. So why not abide by them, just in case? There\u2019s the belief that you shouldn\u2019t give pears or knives as presents, because the word for pears (\u68a8, l\u00ed) sounds like the word for \u201cto leave\u201d (\u96e2, l\u00ed: indicating that you want to leave the relationship), and knives symbolise your wish to sever ties. It is incredibly easy to adhere to this. Pears aren\u2019t in season in Australia anyway, and have you seen the price of knives? Some superstitions do require effort, and that effort mainly involves eating. For example, the idea that the more dumplings you eat, the richer you\u2019ll get. What an imaginative and hopeful culture, to come up with this beautiful fantasy, based on the fact that dumplings are the shape of ingots, an olden-day form of currency. If your family and friends are concerned about the huge number of potstickers you eat in the next few weeks, you can say it\u2019s in your best financial interests to do so. It\u2019s the superstitions surrounding death that I really pay attention to. Superstitions are simply another way to express our preferences if we were given a choice: I prefer to be lucky, I prefer to have good relationships, I prefer to have money. The ultimate preference, of course, is to be alive \u2013 and to wish for the long and happy lives of the people you love. So during the new year I don\u2019t wear black or white, which are the colours of mourning. And I will avoid the number four (\u56db, s\u00ec), which in Chinese sounds like the word for death, or to die (\u6b7b, s\u01d0). I avoid this number when it comes to the number of pieces of fruit I buy or even the number of times I grind salt or pepper. I didn\u2019t realise until recently that lunar new year is not the only time I avoid this number. Six months ago my uncle in Hong Kong became ill with a rare form of cancer. A few days before my mum was about to visit him, knowing it would be for the last time, we were in a cafe together in Sydney. I went up to the counter to order coffees and the waiter gave me a sign for our table: 44. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to take that number back to my mum, even though it was just a number, and it\u2019s not as though a luckier one would change what was to come. But why remind her of the sadness at hand when there were plenty of other numbers on the counter? I asked the waiter if I could change my sign. \u201cI\u2019m Chinese,\u201d I said. He nodded and handed me a 12. It wasn\u2019t an eight \u2013 the luckiest number because it sounds like \u201cto prosper\u201d \u2013 but it would do. After all, you can\u2019t always control what life gives you. Jennifer Wong\u2019s new standup show, The Sweet and Sour of Power, is playing at Adelaide Fringe, Melbourne international comedy festival, Sydney comedy festival, Perth comedy festival and in Brisbane and Canberra",

A union wants to speak for you.\u201d The claim comes as the union prepares to take three days of strike action next week at Amazon\u2019s Coventry warehouse, known as BHX4, as part of an industrial dispute that has been going on for more than a year. Staff are demanding a pay increase to \u00a315 an hour and the right to negotiate with the company over pay and conditions. The Guardian has seen photographs of information boards and company newsletters the GMB said were displayed inside BHX4 and other Amazon warehouses in the region. These show messages including: \u201cThe union wants you to pay \u00a314.37 every month for them to speak for you. We believe having a voice shouldn\u2019t cost you anything,\u201d and: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to join a union to have your voice heard. We\u2019ve got you.\u201d Another says: \u201cBefore you vote or join a union, we encourage you to seek out the facts for yourself. The best relationships are the direct ones.\u201d Gary Smith, the GMB\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cLet\u2019s call this what it is: one of the world\u2019s wealthiest companies engaged in union-busting right here in the UK.\u201d GMB members in Coventry \u201care refusing to be beaten by Amazon\u2019s union-busting and they will win the pay and recognition they deserve\u201d, he added. Kate Bell, assistant general secretary of the TUC, who visited the picket line in Coventry last year, said: \u201cInstead of treating its workforce with the respect it deserves, Amazon is using every trick in the book to stop workers from organising for better pay and conditions.\u201d The GMB\u2019s latest criticism of Amazon comes as it gears up for a fresh battle to achieve formal recognition in Coventry. The union withdrew an application to the independent Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) last year, accusing Amazon of drafting in at least 1,000 additional workers to ensure the GMB could not show it represented a clear majority of staff at the site. The company denied that allegation, saying any new staff were brought in as a result of normal business requirements. With a concerted union recruitment drive continuing at the site, the GMB said it anticipated making a new application to the CAC this spring. An Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cWe respect our employees\u2019 rights to join, or not to join, a union.\u201d",

        "body": "Usher will hit the most-watched music stage of the year this Sunday with his much-anticipated performance during the Super Bowl. The 45-year-old is promising a career-spanning show that will be two minutes longer than the regular 13-minute performances from past years. \u201cI can\u2019t explain why, but it\u2019s a funny thing that I was able to do and craft,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThat was a huge strategic thing that happened between me and my agency.\u201d The singer has still called it \u201cdifficult\u201d to find a way to squeeze his entire career into such a short amount of time. Usher released his first album in 1994 at the age of 16. He has since gone onto sell over 80m records worldwide with major hits including U Make Me Wanna, Good Kisser and Love in This Club. Usher has confirmed that, as is tradition, there will be some surprise guests and told Entertainment Tonight that it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d not to invite his Yeah collaborators Lil Jon and Ludacris up to the stage. He also revealed that he has been getting advice from the previous half-time performer Katy Perry and called it \u201ca moment I\u2019ve prepared for during the last 30 years\u201d which will \u201cdefinitely be an event\u201d. Last year saw Rihanna take the stage with the star making it the most-watched half-time show ever with 121 million viewers. His set will take place during the half-time section of this year\u2019s big game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs, in Las Vegas. It will mark the first time the city has hosted the Super Bowl. Usher recently finished an 18-month Vegas residency. The Chiefs player Travis Kelce has also been making headlines for his much-publicised relationship with Taylor Swift, who has been attending many of his games this past season. The past week has seen speculation that Swift, who picked up the Grammy for album of the year last weekend, would also be at this Sunday\u2019s game. The singer is currently on the Japanese leg of her record-breaking Eras tour which wraps on Saturday. The Embassy of Japan in Washington DC issued a statement on 2 February reassuring fans that she would still have enough time to \u201ccomfortably\u201d make it to the game. Kelce\u2019s mother, Donna, said earlier this week: \u201cWe don\u2019t know until that day if she\u2019ll be coming or not.\u201d Travis has also said of Swift\u2019s attendance: \u201cShe is absolutely the number one fan right now. I love having her at every single game that she can make and we\u2019ll see.\u201d Usher said last November that he would try to involve Swift in his performance is she is there. \u201cI mean, she could be one person that I serenade,\u201d he said. \u201cOr, she could be a special guest.\u201d A recent study showed that American interest in the Super Bowl climbed by 169% from last year. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to have her a part of it,\u201d said the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, this week. \u201cObviously, it creates a buzz. It creates another group of young fans, particularly young women, that are interested in seeing why she is going to this game, why she is interested in this game. Besides [her relationship with] Travis, she is a football fan, and I think that\u2019s great for us.\u201d This Sunday will also see the release of major new movie trailers including first looks at Deadpool 3 and Twisters. Celebrities also set to feature in this year\u2019s big ads include Jennifer Aniston, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ben Affleck. Experts have claimed a 30-second commercial this year will cost around $7m.",

Heads turned late last year when the Royal Court in London announced a season of standup, programmed by big shot comedy producers Avalon, and featuring \u2013 among others \u2013 the co-host of the marital banter podcast Shagged. Married. Annoyed. At one of the UK\u2019s \u2013 the world\u2019s, even \u2013 most respected playhouses, renowned for the purity of its commitment to radical new drama, \u201cit\u2019s grim to see the cupboard looking so bare\u201d tweeted one critic. Grim, maybe. Unique? Far from it. Park theatre in London recently announced a new comedy strand to its programme, becoming the latest of many playhouses responding to trying times by reaching for the nearest comedian. That\u2019s happening for a variety of reasons, says its executive director, Catherine McKinney, although \u201cthere\u2019s no point pretending there isn\u2019t a financial undertone, because there is\u201d. Let\u2019s be clear: theatre is skint. Costs are up, subsidy is down, the old sources of funding are evaporating. This week, a report suggested that the Royal Court\u2019s literary department, responsible for the cultivation of new plays, was under threat. In such a climate, says McKinney, why wouldn\u2019t you turn to standup comedy? \u201cThe outlay is lower than for theatre. There isn\u2019t the need for a period of rehearsal, for complicated sets, all the things that go into making a full-scale theatre production. You can make it happen quickly and easily.\u201d And with attendance at many venues not yet back to pre-Covid levels, standup brings new audiences to theatre too \u2013 including many from sought-after demographics. The Park programmed previews last month of the year\u2019s hippest comedy show, Julia Masli\u2019s ha ha ha ha ha ha ha (before its Soho theatre run), and \u201cwe now know,\u201d says McKinney, \u201cthat 52% of that audience was new to us. We welcome them with open arms.\u201d McKinney worked at Soho before the Park, and acknowledges her ex-employer (as do others I speak to) as a pioneer in the space where comedy and theatre converge. But her key learning from them is that \u201cif a space is ever empty, everybody goes \u2018why? Put something in it, for God\u2019s sake!\u2019 So I\u2019ve come here and gone: we\u2019ve got these beautiful spaces, let\u2019s use them more.\u201d For McKinney, theatre can save itself not just by programming comedy, but by programming more activity full stop. Comedy programming is not happening at the expense of theatre, she insists: \u201cTheatre remains paramount for us.\u201d Comedy will happen in the gaps between, as will more family performances, community use and other ways to wring the most out of a building that\u2019s been under-used until now. Jon Thoday has been trying to get comedy into mainstream theatres for years. He\u2019s the head of Avalon, and the man responsible \u2013 way back when \u2013 for introducing standup to arenas. (That was with David Baddiel and Rob Newman; 30 years later, Baddiel is now part of Avalon\u2019s Royal Court lineup.) \u201cI remember once seeing Robin Williams at the Met,\u201d says Thoday, \u201cand there was something exciting about seeing him playing the opera house.\u201d Is that an anti-establishment excitement? \u201cA bit of that, yeah. I did many years ago contact the Royal Opera House in London to see if I could get that for a [standup] show. And they were very, very uninterested.\u201d So, always, were the Royal Court \u2013 until new artistic director David Byrne took over. Byrne worked with Avalon before on the fringe-turned-West-End hit Operation Mincemeat, and understands, according to Thoday, that standup is a subsection of, and not a threat to, the \u201cnew writing\u201d the Court exists to champion. For Thoday, the argument is simple. Many theatres \u2013 the London Palladium prominent among them \u2013 were built for variety, not exclusively for dramatic performance. It\u2019s a great experience for comedians to perform in them. And it\u2019s a simple case of supply and demand. \u201cTV is less interested in comedy now than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d he says, so he needs different avenues to build audiences for his mid-range acts: your John Kearns, your Pierre Novellies, your Ahir Shahs. \u201cThe Royal Court will have a mailing list, but it may not have people on it you\u2019d expect to go and see standup. But out of that list, some of them will want to come. So this brings our artists to wider audiences as well.\u201d So is this a win-win, for cash-strapped theatres and rising comedy acts? Or is this the thin end of a wedge that could prise theatre out of theatres \u2013 or at least, squeeze the space for the type of theatre that needs big sets, longer-running times, and a quality of attention you arguably don\u2019t get in venues that feel, and operate, like the Edinburgh fringe? The only concession Park theatre has made to accommodate standup, says McKinney, is that, in their Park90 space, \u201cwe\u2019re saying to theatre companies: \u2018Can you make sure your set can go back to the back wall, so we\u2019ve got a playing space [for standups]?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a little thing that everyone\u2019s happy to accommodate \u2013 not least because most of the Park90 companies are already making work in an ecology shaped by Edinburgh, work that has to be short, sharp and light on its feet. Thoday remembers, in the 1990s, \u201cwhen Edinburgh exploded, and there was a whole narrative about comedy killing theatre on the fringe. But I think it\u2019s been completely proved the opposite now.\u201d He points to the West End today, where Operation Mincemeat vies with the musical Six and The Play That Goes Wrong, and sees a theatre world in the fringe\u2019s image, where theatrical and comedic influences and talents rub up and intertwine. \u201cThe boundaries between the different arts are less hard than people think,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an old-fashioned view that it\u2019s the end of days that the Royal Court has got standup comedy in it. I think it\u2019s the beginning of days. It would be great if the Court was more supported by subsidy. But it\u2019s also nice that there\u2019s an artform that can help other artforms survive in difficult times.\u201d",

        "body": "I\u2019d never name names, but last month a senior executive of a global makeup brand told me that while she and her company were focusing their marketing efforts on the desirability of sheer, barely there, glowy makeup, she refused to enter the office without a faceful. I meet lots of women like this. Foundation is a bit like denim: trends can dictate whatever they like, but if you\u2019re someone who feels best in full coverage base and/or skinny jeans, there\u2019s a good chance you always will. Even if you\u2019re curious about the bare-ish makeup trend, unless you\u2019re like Pamela Anderson and look glorious either way, the thought of a make-under can be alarming. If you fall into the former camp, you do you without apology. If you\u2019re in the latter, there are products to make the process less drastic. My favourite launch of the year so far is Chanel\u2019s Les Beiges Healthy Winter Glow Primer (\u00a348). This is, in effect, a light-reflecting skin laminator. It instantly creates a smoother, plumper-looking complexion with the glow of good health. It can be worn alone, but any makeup applied thereafter benefits from a standing start. Weighed down by winter lurgy, I\u2019ve spent much of the past week using this (in the Icy Beige shade \u2013 there are three) to fake better times, and it works. Sculpted By Aimee is an accessible, more affordable brand with ambitions to make makeup less intimidating. Its HydraTint Moisturising Tinted Serum (\u00a323) is a great place for the bare-faced to scale up and for a full-face to pare back. This fluid squeeze-it-out-and-slap-it-on is foolproof and one of my favourite products in recent months. For a skincare-makeup hybrid with a fraction of a foundation\u2019s coverage, it still packs a punch, unifying mildly patchy, uneven skin tone and perking up grey, central heating-parched skin. It doesn\u2019t replace your skincare, but its extra layer of ungreasy moisture is particularly welcome in this frequently foul weather. Makeup By Mario\u2019s Soft Sculpt Transforming Skin Enhancer (\u00a335) is uniquely brilliant and beloved across genders. This solid moisturising balm (in six ultra-sheer shades, all designed to be worn slightly darker than your natural skin tone) can be swept hastily with a fat brush all over the face. It does a fantastic job of making skin appear flawlessly naked when it is really nothing of the sort.",

        "body": "I have a pet peeve that I share with a lot of gardener friends: the social media-driven push to start sowing seeds now, even though it\u2019s simply too early for most of us. Buoyed by the memory of generously warm springs \u2013 like that of 2020 \u2013 we could be forgiven for being optimistic and sow seeds in the hope that this coming spring will be just as ideal for our early crops. But British weather is unpredictable, so why plant seeds now when those sown later will probably fare better? This is true for the vast number of crops that I\u2019ll be sowing when the daffodils are in full bloom. But there are notable exceptions \u2013 and one is the aubergine. This vegetable was at the heart of the Mauritian cooking I grew up on, and so came to associate it with warmer climates, but it\u2019s very possible \u2013 and very satisfying! \u2013 to grow aubergines in the UK. Aubergine seeds ought to be started in February, as this gives them the best chance of reaching the point of harvest before autumn arrives. Like their fellow nightshades, the tomato and the chilli, aubergines need warmth to germinate, so start your seeds in a propagator, on a heated seedling mat or in an airing cupboard. But once they germinate, it\u2019s essential to position your seedlings where they can get as much sunlight as possible. Sadly, my greenhouse is far too cold and my windowsills aren\u2019t bright enough, so I use grow lights to ensure my seedlings don\u2019t become weak and leggy. Since it isn\u2019t possible for every grower to provide these conditions, I\u2019m a big fan of outsourcing this task to the pros and ordering plug plants. Aubergines need generous watering, nutritious soil or compost and warmth to prosper, so once my plants are large enough I give them a coveted spot in my small greenhouse. They can be grown outside, but only if you have a sunny, protected spot for them. And dwarf varieties can be grown in large containers. Come the start of summer, they\u2019ll hit their stride and produce ample leaves, soon followed by pretty lilac flowers heavy with pollen. They need the assistance of pollinators for those flowers to transform into fruit, so, just in case, I mist them and use a small paintbrush to move their pollen from stamen to stigma. Aubergines are ready to harvest when they\u2019re plump and their skin is shiny \u2013 usually from midsummer onwards \u2013 though take care as their spines are surprisingly sharp and tricky to spot. I love to grow the variety \u201cLong Purple\u201d, as they\u2019re most like the ones my parents grew up eating. And last year I had great luck with the \u201cCzech Early\u201d, which cropped abundantly.",

This succulent bulb loves to bask in full sun to partial shade. If the leaves start losing their twist, they need more light. Where should I put it? This South African native thrives in a warm, well-lit spot away from draughts. It\u2019s perfect for brightening up a desk or shelf where its quirky spirals can be fully appreciated. How do I keep it alive? As a succulent it is drought-tolerant, which means it\u2019s forgiving if you forget to water it occasionally. Feed it with a succulent fertiliser in spring to promote growth. Did you know \u2026 The frizzle sizzle has an unusual dormancy period in summer, allowing it to survive the dry climate of its native habitat. It is known to produce a slime when cut or handled\u2013 a feature of plants in the Albuca genus.

        "body": "The Book of Doors by Gareth Brown (Bantam, \u00a316.99) When Cassie receives the gift of a small leatherbound book, her life is transformed. It has the power to make \u201cany door every door\u201d, allowing her to walk out of her New York apartment on to a street in Paris, Venice, Prague \u2013 anywhere she\u2019s been, or seen a picture of. Her best friend, Izzy, worries about how criminals could use it, while Cassie thinks they should just enjoy this amazing freedom. But Izzy was right to worry: the Book of Doors is just one of a small number of magical books, each with a different power, and although not many know they exist, some collectors won\u2019t stop at murder to get what they want. What begins like a joyous daydream soon becomes a suspenseful thriller. It\u2019s a truly magical book: exciting, intricately plotted and emotionally compelling. Shigidi and the Brass Head of Obalufon by Wole Talabi (Gollancz, \u00a322) The first novel from the Nigerian author of award-winning short stories is set in two worlds: ours, and the spirit side, where ancient gods have modernised into corporate board members who employ lesser spirits to deal with prayers and petitions. Shigidi, a minor god of nightmares, falls in love with the sexy, mysterious Nneoma, a succubus who feeds on human souls, and convinces him to be her partner in the freelance life. But his employer, the Orisha Spirit Company, won\u2019t release him unless he steals back a precious sacred object from the British Museum. With their supernatural powers, the partners expect it to be an easy heist \u2013 until they tangle with London\u2019s own spirit guardians. Moving back and forth in time, and between Lagos, London, Singapore and Algeria, this is a vivid, entertaining tale of love, power and revenge. Red Side Story by Jasper Fforde (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320) The long-awaited sequel to 2010\u2019s Shades of Grey continues the story set in a country that used to be Britain \u2013 before Something Happened. Society now operates on a hierarchical, colour-based system, where everyone\u2019s place and role are determined by the range of colours they are able to see. Eddie and Jane belong to hues of red and green: strictly prohibited from marriage, and now awaiting trial for a murder they did not commit. No one is allowed to question the many strict rules, no matter how absurd. But Eddie and Jane are in love, smart and curious, willing to run any risk to find out the truth about their world. Cleverly constructed, with engaging characters and lots of good jokes, this sparkling Wizard of Oz-inspired fantasy is the second book in an intended trilogy, and one of the quirkiest dystopias ever imagined. Past Crimes by Jason Pinter (Severn House, \u00a321.99) The first venture into science fiction by a well-regarded crime writer is set in the 2040s, when Americans are spending most of their waking hours in an immersive virtual reality network known as Earth+. The popularity of true crime as entertainment has grown exponentially, with new tech allowing total sensory engagement. Subscribers to the simulations produced by entertainment company Past Crimes have the option of being not merely observers but players in famous historic crimes. Cassie West, the widow of the man held responsible for an outbreak of mass suicides and murders known as the Blight, is probably the only person in the world who believes the real culprit got away with it. She thinks she\u2019s found evidence that he\u2019s planning to strike again, with a massacre timed to coincide with the release of the highly anticipated Blight simulation. But will anyone believe her? A tense, unputdownable near-future thriller, chillingly believable about some of the drawbacks of life lived increasingly in non-physical spaces. The City of Stardust by Georgia Summers (Hodderscape, \u00a320) The Everly family is cursed: for generations, their youngest has been taken by the terrifying, ageless Penelope in payment of a long-ago debt. Violet is the last of the line, since her mother vanished on a quest to break the curse; unless she returns, Violet will be sacrificed instead. As the deadline approaches, newly adult Violet goes on her own quest. She looks to Penelope\u2019s assistant, Aleksander, for help, knowing she shouldn\u2019t trust him, but tempted by his stories of another world, where he lives in a city of scholar-magicians. Things soon turn very dark in an ambitious debut that doesn\u2019t live up to its initial promise, flawed by an overly complicated, confusing plot and thin characterisations.",

        "body": "Loch and awe in the Highlands Last Easter, to escape the hustle and bustle and stresses of daily life, my partner and I took a few days\u2019 trip to stay in the Highlands of Scotland. At Portsonachan Hotel (doubles from \u00a3106 a night B&amp;B) overlooking the aptly named Loch Awe \u2013 the longest freshwater loch in Scotland \u2013 we found we could mentally and physically unwind. As the mist cleared over the loch each morning, stunning views emerged, creating what my partner would refer to as a \u201csoul spa\u201d. With our holidays usually jam-packed with activities, it was refreshing to change gear and just take relaxing woodland walks amid nature and to recharge the batteries whenever we felt like it. Greg Marshall Bathing \u2013 in a forest and in a tub, Wye Valley Last summer my family and I visited Forest Retreats, near Tintern, overlooking the Wye valley, for three nights\u2019 glamping in one of its luxury yurts. We had an amazing time, relaxing in the outdoor eco spa and taking part in a yoga class. It is a beautiful setting that is a superb base for forest bathing too, but mostly it\u2019s just a really calming place to spend some time in the outdoors. Jo Grim Swimming and nature near York The seasonal Elements mini retreats hosted near York by Laura Fazio were a real highlight of 2023 for me. The retreats combine yoga, breath work, wild swimming and a campfire brunch followed by a guided meditation. The riverside location is perfect for appreciating nature \u2013 I\u2019ll always remember spotting the electric blue streak of a kingfisher after a rather splendid dip. I leave feeling so rejuvenated and full of gratitude. Fern Under the bridge, Bristol You don\u2019t need to spend money for meditation and relaxation. Personally, I like to walk through the forest under the Clifton Suspension Bridge and sit on a rock and meditate. It\u2019s the best therapy out there! Zoe Bliss in Essex It was a real pleasure to stay at the Glass House (rooms from \u00a3240 per person per night) retreat in Essex, in the countryside near Upminster. I enjoyed yoga, walks, swimming and meditation, and brilliant, rich facials, which left my skin glowing. The purpose-built modern spa also offers cryotherapy in its cold therapy chamber, though I didn\u2019t try it. The place offers lovely plant-based food, full of good greens. Best of all, the staff were so helpful and friendly. Caroline G Winning tip: cabin solitude in the Scottish Borders I searched online at Airbnb and booked a stunning and simple log cabin on the edge of the pretty hamlet of Abbey Saint Bathans, in the Scottish Borders, about 40 minutes\u2019 drive from Berwick-upon-Tweed. It felt remarkably remote and peaceful with gorgeous walks on the doorstep, with a mix of forests, hills, meadows, crystal clear rivers clean enough for a dip, and a beautifully simple yet comfortable space for one or two people to unplug and relax. The cabin is big enough for a yoga mat, as is the outside terrace. We went for a break in 2022 there, and for tranquillity and peace nowhere else has come close. Bethan",

        "body": "Pick of the week Aftersun What an utterly lovely, delicately heartbreaking film Charlotte Wells has made. The mysteries of adulthood and the loss of innocence are all wrapped up in a summer holiday in Turkey taken by 11-year-old Sophie (a cheeky, adorable Frankie Corio) and her dad Calum \u2013 a superbly layered performance by Paul Mescal. Amid the lazy days by the hotel pool, all-inclusive buffets, boat trips and excursions to ancient ruins, Calum\u2019s hidden melancholy surfaces. It\u2019s mitigated by the tenderness and comfort of his relationship with his daughter, but there\u2019s something gnawing at him we struggle to fathom, in a superbly made tale with all the warmth of a tightly held memory. Sunday 11 February, 10pm, BBC Two *** The Falling Our cinematic introduction to the great Florence Pugh was in Carol Morley\u2019s dreamlike, sensual 2014 work. She plays charismatic girls\u2019 school pupil Abbie \u2013 an object of envy to her peers and teachers, even best friend Lydia (Maisie Williams). But when Abbie has a sudden and inexplicable seizure, it sets off a chain reaction of mass fits among the other students. Is it rebellion, collective grief or just overactive teen hormones? Edging towards folk horror, and with nods to Picnic at Hanging Rock and the dislocating films of Nicolas Roeg, it\u2019s an unsettling experience. Sunday 11 February, 11.35pm, BBC Two *** Frost/Nixon Adapted from Peter \u201cThe Crown\u201d Morgan\u2019s play, Ron Howard\u2019s film tells the fascinating true story of the 1977 interview British talkshow host David Frost secured with the disgraced former US president Richard Nixon. Michael Sheen plays Frost as an ambitious, self-preening media operator desperate to become a success in the US again. Frank Langella is Nixon, bitter about his downfall and keen to rehabilitate himself. The battle of wits and wills between the performer and the politician makes for sparky drama. Sunday 11 February, 5.55pm, Sky Cinema Greats *** Past Lives Celine Song\u2019s wonderful, wistful movie asks the question: what if your first love was the greatest love of your life? That\u2019s the doubt facing Nora (Greta Lee), who moved from South Korea to Canada when she was 12 and lost touch with the boy she\u2019d got close to, Hae-sung (Teo Yoo). Twelve years later, they reconnect through a series of video calls \u2013 but without being able to meet in person, where can the relationship go? Song\u2019s film sidesteps melodrama to ponder the sometimes painful weight of history on the present, and the decisions we make about who to love. SW Thursday 15 February, Netflix *** This Is Me \u2026 Now: A Love Story As befits someone as practised in the acting world as the pop realm, Jennifer Lopez\u2019s new album is accompanied by an ambitious feature film. Helmed by music video director Dave Myers, it combines tracks from This Is Me \u2026 Now with autobiographical drama and epic scenes of colourful, intricately choreographed fantasy. Cameos from her new spouse Ben Affleck, Post Malone, Sofia Vergara and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson give a flavour of the broad sweep of J-Lo\u2019s interests. Friday 16 February, Prime Video *** Mission: Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part One There is no stopping Tom Cruise. The seventh instalment in the big bucks espionage series is largely identical to the previous six but is almost embarrassingly easy to like. With imaginative action sequences (the train scenes are vertiginous), extreme stuntwork, often by Cruise himself, desirable global locations (Paris, Rome, the Orient Express), convoluted plotting \u2013 he and his rogue agents basically fight the internet \u2013 plus new faces in Hayley Atwell and Pom Klementieff, it\u2019s exhilarating business as usual for the Cruiser. Friday 16 February, 11.15am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** The Thing John Carpenter\u2019s entertainingly gruesome 1982 horror remake has the alien that invades an Antarctic research station able to imitate any life form (rather than just being a lumbering man in a creature suit, as in its predecessor The Thing from Another World). Paranoia reigns as the staff don\u2019t know who\u2019s infected and who\u2019s not \u2013 but Kurt Russell\u2019s helicopter pilot MacReady is certain it isn\u2019t him and tries to make a survival plan. Cold war-style \u201creds under the bed\u201d fears mingle with Agatha Christie\u2019s And Then There Were None as the mutating ET picks the men off one by one. Friday 16 February, 10.50pm, Film4",

        "body": "The lead-up to this week\u2019s Aacta awards seems to have unfolded in the usual way, with industry folk feeling tinges of excitement while the general public remains largely indifferent. But in terms of screen content, 2023 was no ordinary period \u2013 particularly for Australian television. There was the occasional lemon (looking at you, Warnie) but I can\u2019t recall another year since streaming took off that provided so many well-produced shows in such close succession. Let\u2019s start with productions recognised by the Aactas. Among the 12 titles nominated for best drama series and best miniseries, all bar one (Bay of Fires) are good, solid shows and two are excellent. The good and solid include the beautifully shot The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart, the highly ambitious domestic violence drama Safe Home, the doomsday cult thriller The Clearing and the rousing, if a little patchy musical In Our Blood. The excellent ones should be watched post-haste if you haven\u2019t seen them. Revolving around a TV newsroom in the 80s, The Newsreader is a class act: the storylines are engaging, the characters well-drawn, the performances top-notch \u2013 including Anna Torv and Sam Reid as romantically attached news anchors. Also up there with the best is Love Me, about a middle-class Melbourne family navigating a series of romantic and personal challenges. It too features a rock-solid cast including Hugo Weaving, Bojana Novakovic, William Lodder and Heather Mitchell. Moving on to the nominations for best narrative comedy series. Two are absolute gold. One is Deadloch, a wickedly entertaining series created and written by Kates McCartney and McLennan that rightly turned heads, injecting fresh blood into the police procedural. The plot involves a boisterous, decorum-breaking detective (Madeleine Sami) who helps a small town cop (Kate Box) get to the bottom of a grisly murder or two. Another \u2013 which actually arrived in December 2022 \u2013 is Colin From Accounts, a spritzy romcom created, written by and starring Harriet Dyer and Patrick Brammall. It begins with a meet-cute bringing together Dyer and Brammall\u2019s characters: a student doctor and a brewery owner respectively. My colleague Lucy Mangan liked this delightful series even more than I did, dishing out five stars just on the basis of the first two episodes. Another quality series to score an Aacta nod \u2013 for best children\u2019s program \u2013 is the under-appreciated Crazy Fun Park, a sassy young adult production with a memorable central location: a dilapidated amusement park populated by ghosts. But what about the stand-outs that the Aactas didn\u2019t recognise? Top of the list is The Messenger: a surreal, noirish story about a teenage cab driver (William McKenna) who receives mysterious playing cards inscribed with addresses. At each of them there\u2019s some kind of problem for him to solve. And lest we forget the fabulous The Artful Dodger: a zippy Dickensian comedy that relocates the titular character (of Oliver Twist fame) to Australia, now working as a surgeon. Going into 2024, the big question is whether this glut of quality content can continue. Early signs are positive, even if streamers have been spending less on local content. The year got off to a cracking start with the second season of The Tourist, re-uniting Jamie Dorman\u2019s amnesiac protagonist and the affable Constable Helen Chambers (Danielle Macdonald), who are now romantically entwined. As Leila Latif wrote: \u201cThe twists come thick and fast: some funny, some cruel, almost all ludicrous.\u201d Meanwhile, Boy Swallows Universe did a mostly great job adapting Trent Dalton\u2019s acclaimed novel of the same name. But the best of the year so far is the megachurch drama Prosper, which I smashed through in no time, greedily gobbling up its sordid twists and turns. Phew! So many impressive shows; too many, in fact, to squeeze into one article. That\u2019s a pretty good problem to have.",

        "body": "At the end of 2021, Sara* dove headfirst into a decision she would later regret. She had made \u201csome money\u201d buying cryptocurrency and wanted to use it to get into the property market. She felt there were two options she could afford: a studio apartment in the city; or teaming up with a friend to split the cost of a house in a regional area. Desperate for extra space after the pandemic, she chose the latter, and the pair bought a little seaside fixer-upper cottage. They planned to do some light renovations, then live there together. Sara was excited about buying with one of her closest friends, someone she\u2019d known for over a decade \u2013 \u201clonger than any relationship I\u2019ve had\u201d. But things unravelled quickly. The renovations blew out, becoming far more expensive than either had anticipated. Interest rates started their rapid ascent, adding extra financial pressure. Sara began to feel that she was doing more renovation work than her buying partner, creating a sense of imbalance. And they started to clash on decisions, big and small. \u201cWe\u2019re getting into stupid fights about what floorboards we\u2019re going to get because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s always like, \u2018we can\u2019t afford that\u2019,\u201d Sara says. She assumed years of friendship meant they would make a good team. \u201cAnd then you find out through the process of trying to build a house together that maybe you\u2019re not actually that compatible.\u201d At the start of the process the pair paid a lawyer to write out some terms, including what they\u2019d do if one party wanted to sell \u2013 \u201cas a friendship protector,\u201d Sara says. But \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in the clauses that says you can\u2019t be difficult\u201d. They\u2019re now close to finishing the renovations. But after all this, do they even want to live there anymore? \u201cNot really, no,\u201d Sara says. \u201cSo many things have changed.\u201d Sara and her friend aren\u2019t alone in pooling their money to get on the property ladder. Often, those looking to buy with a friend will use a tenants in common agreement \u2013 a legal structure where each party has a defined share of a property they\u2019re purchasing (rather than an automatic 50/50 split). Victoria Divine, a mortgage broker, podcaster and author of Property with She\u2019s on the Money, says lately she puts together a tenants in common agreement \u201cevery two weeks or so\u201d. The incentives for buddying up to buy are obvious. \u201cBuying property is getting harder and harder,\u201d Divine says. She points out that property prices have far outstripped wage growth, putting home ownership out of reach for most people on a single salary. This means those who still want to buy property have to \u201clook for alternate ways of doing it\u201d. \u201cAnd buying property with other people, whether that\u2019s a friend or a family member, can obviously get you into home ownership faster.\u201d When it works well, buying with friends or family can be a foot into the market, or a way to afford something with better capital growth potential, building equity that can be used on a forever home later. And it\u2019s not just young people who are doing it. Divine says she\u2019s seen a number of older women buy together: \u201cSingle mums getting in with another single mum and cohabitating and living their best life.\u201d But it\u2019s \u201cso important to choose the right person,\u201d Divine says \u2013 because there are a raft of ways it can go wrong. While banks are generally happy to lend to those buying as tenants in common, many will require the two parties act as guarantor for each other, which means being on the hook for the other party\u2019s debt if they stop paying. A co-owner defaulting on their mortgage could affect the other\u2019s credit rating, and because all owners need to agree to a sale, co-owners can end up trapped if one party wants to sell but the other refuses. Or, as Sara\u2019s experience shows, it might simply erode a relationship through a thousand smaller squabbles. Some worst-case scenarios can be planned for through a legal document called a cohabitation agreement, Divine says. These stipulate terms for a purchase \u2013 for instance, planning for what might happen if one person can no longer meet their financial commitment, or simply laying out exit strategies. (This is the legally-binding, but not personally effective \u201cfriendship protector\u201d Sara speaks of). Hamish Landreth, a financial consultant at Prosperity Wealth Advisers, says that buying property via a company or a trust is another way to structure co-ownership, and allows for more flexibility to change ownership percentages in the future, if one party wants out. Of course, buying with a partner isn\u2019t foolproof, either \u2013 couples break-up. And many of the legal implications are the same either way. \u201cBut the difference is when you\u2019re with a partner, you\u2019re going through a shared set of circumstances,\u201d Landreth says. \u201cWith someone else, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019re going to have different circumstances. One person might suddenly need to move overseas for work. In a couple, you\u2019re making that decision together.\u201d Or one person might simply want to move out. That\u2019s what happened to Hayley*, who bought a property with her two older sisters when they were all in their 20s. After a few years living together, Hayley\u2019s eldest sister had a baby and wanted her own home, so she sold her share in the property to their middle sister. The structure of their loan meant that Hayley became her middle sister\u2019s guarantor, \u201cfor a huge amount of money\u201d. Hayley later met her own husband. When the couple wanted to buy a house together, Hayley discovered her options were severely restricted by her sister\u2019s debt. Going in, she did not consider this possibility, and it made for a stressful experience. \u201cWe were all just frustrated \u2026 really bound together and financially stuck,\u201d she says. \u201cYou buy in your mid-20s and suddenly everyone changes in different ways \u2013 suddenly one sister is married with kids and doesn\u2019t want to live in that area, and another sister moved overseas.\u201d Their goals no longer aligned, she says. The trio eventually sold. But it remains a family sore spot, especially for Hayley\u2019s middle sister, who took on too much debt to buy the eldest out. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a taboo topic,\u201d Hayley says. \u201cLike, it really hurts.\u201d However, Hayley doesn\u2019t regret the purchase. She and her sisters bought over a decade ago, and getting into the market early eventually benefitted her financially, despite the painful period. It\u2019s also possible to have a perfectly smooth experience buying as tenants in common. Deb* and her best friend bought an apartment together in 2018, and moved from Sydney to Melbourne to live there. Their only contract was a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d around what they would do if one party needed to sell. Five years on, Deb\u2019s friend is planning to move back to Sydney to be closer to her parents; but she has given Deb a couple of years notice. This means Deb has time to prepare for buying her friend out, which she intends to do. \u201cMy story is probably one of the better ones,\u201d Deb says. She and her friend had known each other for years, and travelled together \u2013 \u201ctravelling really does make or break friendships\u201d \u2013 so the communication has been straightforward. Plus, in the current interest rate environment, Deb is relieved to only have half a mortgage to worry about. \u201cI do feel sorry for families on one income that have a million-dollar mortgage.\u201d And would she have been able to buy at all without teaming up with her friend? \u201cGod no,\u201d Deb says. Meanwhile Sara feels bound, emotionally and financially. \u201cMy money is just all tied up in this house,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the thing people don\u2019t realise is we\u2019re effectively de facto in this \u2026 we have our own mortgages, but we\u2019re so tied.\u201d It has been a first-home buyer\u2019s baptism of fire. \u201cI\u2019m someone who didn\u2019t come from money, but I suddenly came into money. In a moment of vulnerability or naivety, I got swept up in this idea of buying a home because it was somewhere for me to put my money at that moment,\u201d she says. \u201cBut \u2026 I put myself in a pretty tricky spot.\u201d The contract the pair signed did lay out an exit strategy \u2013 if one party wants to sell, the other gets first dibs to buy them out. If that isn\u2019t possible, the pair have to sell. Given neither has the funds to buy the other out, Sara thinks they will probably end up selling the property far sooner than they anticipated. She just has to hold out until then. \u201cI guess the benefit is that it\u2019s not forever, and I still have money that\u2019s secure, and we\u2019ll have a nice place eventually,\u201d Sara says. \u201cThat\u2019s more than a lot of people get.\u201d *Names have been changed",

        "body": "Your editorial (2 February) was right to highlight the importance of using churches as \u201clocal anchor institutions\u201d and to praise the National Churches Trust report calling for an expansion of the secular uses of church buildings. In Droxford, a small Hampshire village, we have rescued our Grade I Norman church from the brink of ruin to become a thriving community hub. The church now hosts Wilfrid\u2019s \u2013 a volunteer-run cafe open five days a week, a new bell-ringing team, a computer club, and a growing heritage centre. Thanks to the popularity of the cafe and other activities, more than \u00a310,000 was distributed last year to the local community, with over half going towards church and churchyard projects. We could not have achieved this outcome without investment in the church building, first to make it safe, and second to build an annexe for a kitchen and toilets. Our vision was backed by major grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund and a range of secular bodies, including Hampshire county council, and numerous small donors. Sadly, the NCT was not among them because it insisted that our lead architect had to be \u201cconservation accredited\u201d, despite his relevant experience. An alliance of church officials and architects on the diocesan advisory committee also turned down our project, voting to preserve the status quo rather than adapt the building to serve the needs of the community. The success of our project despite these setbacks shows that there is a way forward to preserve our church heritage for the benefit of all. There is still work to be done to persuade the architectural profession and the church authorities that churches must be permitted to adapt to serve their communities in the 21st century. I hope that the NCT is now ready to lead the way. John Symes Trustee and former chair, Friends of Droxford Church \u2022 I was alarmed to see the Guardian supporting a report published by the National Churches Trust calling for \u201cat least \u00a350 million\u201d a year of public funding to be ringfenced to maintain churches. It is true that some churches have historical, architectural, cultural and social value, and so there may be a public interest in maintaining them. But it should be noted that Church of England, likely to be the main recipient of government funding, holds significant wealth. Church Commissioners for England, the charity that manages the C of E\u2019s funds, has assets valued at \u00a310.3bn. An unnecessary burden on the taxpayer should be avoided where those responsible for maintaining places of worship have the available assets to fund their own maintenance and repairs. Stephen Evans Chief executive officer, National Secular Society \u2022 What a great shame that some of our most magnificent buildings are struggling for life in these times of austerity. Although not a practising Christian, I always love to spend time in churches when I\u2019m visiting places around the nation. Many, of course, have been converted to other uses. If the rot is to stop, they need to diversify, just like farmers. There\u2019s a long tradition of brewing and ale use in our ecclesiastical heritage, and today many churches are benefiting from the support of beer festivals. Last year a York Camra ran one in St Lawrence\u2019s church, second only in size here to York Minster. We paid a significant rent, which is helping to enable improvements and repairs. We need events like this to make wider social use of underutilised buildings. Karl Smith York \u2022 It\u2019s time that the medieval churches in the UK were renationalised. Privatised by the government in the 1530s, they were handed out to the friends and families of the establishment. Once back in state hands, their upkeep can be paid for through the rent raised from any organisation that would like to use them, be it a soft play company, the Post Office or the Church of England.

Is it the melting cheese, the flutter of icing sugar, the drizzle of chocolate, the falling slice of perfectly cooked beef, the crunch of the roast potato?

        "body": "Runner\u2019s knee struck me down at the worst possible time \u2013 in early 2020, right before the pandemic. While everyone around me started lacing up trainers for their \u201cdaily hour of exercise\u201d, I was unable to jog to the end of the road without pain flaring up in both of my knee joints for days. I honestly believed that I would never run again. And after an MRI scan on my knee revealed I had \u201cshallow grooves\u201d in which the patella slipped around, a specialist told me to think about taking up a lower-impact sport like swimming instead. \u201cYou\u2019re not built for running,\u201d a specialist told me. \u201cSo maybe just don\u2019t do it.\u201d \u201cOh really, he told you that?\u201d says physio Uzo Ehiogu. Ehiogu is the founder of Inside Edge physiotherapy in Birmingham, and a specialist in musculoskeletal issues for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, as well as being an accredited strength and conditioning coach. As someone who recognises the benefits of running \u2013 for both physical and mental health \u2013 he is not the kind of person to tell someone to quit an exercise they enjoy unless it really is essential. And the good news is most runners can take simple steps to reduce their chances of being struck down with the dreaded runner\u2019s knee. But what is runner\u2019s knee? Ehiogu admits that it is a bit of a woolly phrase, a catch-all term for any niggles at the front of the knee. \u201cBut broadly speaking, most clinicians are referring to patellofemoral joint pain. This is a condition in which the kneecap and its associated structures become overloaded.\u201d An overload injury is likely to develop slowly over time. Unlike, say, a sprained ankle, there is no sudden moment of trauma where something important tears. This is certainly how it was with me. In 2018, I challenged myself to get my 5km time down to under 20 minutes. That meant a steep incline in intense running. When my knees hurt a little the next day, I viewed it simply as inevitable soreness, and ploughed on with intense interval sessions. I was making a typical mistake. \u201cOften people will feel sore the next day, then get back on it a couple of days later and reinjure the same tissue that is trying to repair itself,\u201d says Ehiogu. \u201cIf you keep doing this injury-repair cycle, eventually what happens is you have a knee that\u2019s persistently annoyed. Things can become quite recalcitrant if you keep doing this. So my first advice is, if you feel pain, back off. Two weeks is probably about the time that you need to calm it down. So rather than running maybe go to the gym and do some upper body weights or cycle. If it settles down, add some sensible progressive increases and you might not need to see a physio.\u201d Just be careful not to start back up where you were at before. \u201cDrop whatever you were doing before it started by about 25% to 30%. Then gradually increase training by about 10% per week,\u201d says Ehiogu. Reader: I didn\u2019t do any of this. Determined to complete my quest, I ignored my pain and, by the time I finally sneaked under the 20-minute mark in the summer of 2019, I was used to hobbling around in pain for 48 hours afterwards. People who do what I did risk permanently damaging their knees, wearing through the cartilage and turning your runner\u2019s knee into a bone stress injury. Luckily I hadn\u2019t gone that far. But I was in a position where simply resting for a few weeks wasn\u2019t helping. I needed physio intervention, which I finally embarked upon 18 months after I was forced off the road, with a fantastic physiotherapist called Fred Manning. It was a slow process, tailored to my individual situation, but it was also a rewarding one. We started with gentle squats performed while supporting my back against a wall, which was about all I could stand pain wise, and moved towards gradually harder tasks until I was performing 20 single-leg squats with virtually no pain at all. What I loved about my physio wasn\u2019t simply that he prescribed the correct treatment path, but that he was able to describe what was going on in my body in a way that made sense and therefore motivated me to put in the time to fix it. \u201cMy athletes say the same to me,\u201d says Ehiogu, who has worked with runners, tennis players and soldiers. \u201cThey want to know, \u2018OK, why am I doing this? How does it work? How long will it take to get better?\u2019 Being able to explain those three things makes a big difference.\u201d What worked for me might not necessarily be the correct path for others suffering from runner\u2019s knee, but Ehiogu says there are some simple exercises we can all do to build lower body strength and keep some of the pressure off our knees. \u201cBasically you want to increase muscle strength around the quadriceps, the glutes and the calf [see examples below]. Those three muscles are really important because they\u2019re your antigravitational muscles.\u201d Flexibility, as well as strength, is important, and Ehiogu also suggests stretching the hip flexors, quads and calves because that will help you move into the best possible position for running \u2013 what\u2019s known as the triple extension: \u201cWhere the hips are in extension, the knees are in extension and they\u2019re pushing off from the toes.\u201d So how often should we stretch? \u201cObviously, the more stretching you do, the better,\u201d he says. \u201cBut most people are time-poor so it\u2019s probably more realistic to say stretch every time you run \u2013 and afterwards, not before. Try to do two or three sets of between 30 and 40 seconds on each one.\u201d Perhaps the most fascinating thing I discovered during my journey back to running was the relationship between pain and tissue damage. Although I was getting burning knee pain whenever I tried to restart training, my physio pointed out that it was unlikely I was doing untold damage to my joints in the space of 500 metres. Rather, my brain had been trained to set off a warning system whenever it felt any significant loading on the knees. Part of my rehabilitation involved teaching my central nervous system to realise that certain movements were safe again \u2013 softly hopping, for instance, or jumping off a step. \u201cPain is essentially a prehistoric alarm system that says: \u2018There\u2019s damage!\u2019\u201d says Ehiogu. \u201cBut if I am seeing you three or four months into an injury, and the scans say that, actually, the cartilage underneath is fine, the bone is fine, then the pain is probably just because your nervous system is hypersensitive. You\u2019ve had ongoing symptoms for such a long period that your brain is now starting to develop a memory of them.\u201d All of which is to say, best not to let things get as bad as I did. Of course, there are some other simple things you can do to help your knees out. Making sure your trainers are in good shape is one. Everyone runs differently, so go on \u201cfeel\u201d rather than mileage, says Ehiogu \u2013 when they start to lose their springy bounce it is probably time to upgrade. Having your gait analysed so you buy the correct trainers will also help. As will running on softer ground, rather than pavement, and not overdoing the steep hills. As for trying to spend your way out of knee pain? Well, I\u2019ve been there and I\u2019ve got the supplements, massage guns and rolls of kinesiology tape to show for it. None of these things are necessarily bad, says Ehiogu, but they should be viewed as complementary therapies alongside the hard work \u2013 they won\u2019t magically fix your problems. There is no getting around the fact that running has a high impact on our joints \u2013 and especially the knees. And because we all have different biomechanics, predicting who is going to get knee pain, and when it will strike, isn\u2019t always possible. \u201cUltimately it\u2019s going to come down to: what is your body willing to tolerate at this moment in time?\u201d says Ehiogu. Four years on from thinking I would never run again, I have achieved things that weren\u2019t possible before thanks to the improved muscle strength supporting my knees. Whereas previously I would have had to stop around the 12km mark due to a tight IT band (another injury that can affect the knees), these days I can run half marathons without so much of a twinge. But I\u2019m not complacent and know that running injuries are always lurking around the corner if we don\u2019t take care of our joints. Nobody is a perfect runner, after all. \u201cIf you look at runners around the world and compare them to what is the textbook, ideal way to run, there\u2019s always a bit of deviation off that,\u201d says Ehiogu. \u201cAs people start to fatigue, that deviation starts to increase. So even the best runners in the world deviate from what is the best way to run.\u201d And, as physios like Ehiogu show, even some of the most middling runners can overcome their knee problems and get back on the track. Stretch this: Uzo Ehiogu\u2019s strengthening exercises Assuming you are not injured, these exercises should help build muscles that support the knees while running. Calf raises \u201cVery simple, just move up on to your toes then slowly back down. Start off with double-leg calf raises \u2013 using both legs at the same time. Once you can do three sets of 10 repetitions with ease then you can progress this exercise to single-leg raises, which places all of your bodyweight on to each leg.\u201d Weighted squats \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have a barbell across your back to do these. A kettlebell or a weight will do. Sometimes I even tell people to put books in a bag and just hold on to it. These will target the quads and the glutes. Again, when you can do three sets of 10 repetitions then it\u2019s time to progress by increasing the weight.\u201d Side-lying leg lifts \u201cLie on your side with your bottom leg slightly bent for balance, then raise the other one slowly up and down. Try to stop the leg that you raise from creeping forward to ensure you target the gluteal muscles. When three sets of 10 repetitions start to feel easy use an elastic exercise band to make it harder.\u201d",

        "body": "Melissa, 64 I have insecurities about my own body, so sex is not as straightforwardly pleasurable for me Don and I love routine. We have had a pre-dinner drink at the exact same time \u2013 6.20pm \u2013 almost every night of our 40-year marriage. Sex is also scheduled: we do it once every three days. I\u2019ve made a playlist called Sexy, which I put on to set the mood. The songs, like our sex positions, rarely vary. We might start with a little foreplay, to the tune of Etta James\u2019s I Just Want to Make Love to You, and finish in missionary, to Madonna\u2019s Hanky Panky. Don would ideally like to do it three times a day, like we did in our 20s; so doing it once every three days is our compromise. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t desire Don: he still has the body of an athlete. But I have insecurities about my own body, so sex is not as straightforwardly pleasurable for me. I am muscular, with slim hips, and have always felt unfeminine. Sometimes I\u2019m unable to orgasm because I become fixated on the marks childbirth has left on my body, or my lack of breasts. For most of our relationship, I\u2019ve made sure every time we have sex I am covered by a sheet. When I feel particularly consumed with body worries, I try to get myself back into the mood by resorting to fantasy: while Don and I are having sex I\u2019ll picture other women in my mind, with more perfect figures, to distract me from my own. If we move swiftly through a series of tried-and-tested positions I stay focused on sensation, and don\u2019t worry so much about the way I look. I think that\u2019s partly why I like scheduling sex, and sticking to our routine. When I know exactly what to expect, I am less likely to become self-conscious. My favourite sort of sex is fast and furious. Don is always very loving and reassuring. He is constantly complimenting my breasts and asking me to do strip-teases, although I usually only relent on anniversaries. Recently though, I\u2019ve started doing things I didn\u2019t think were possible for me. Last summer he did a bit of sunbathing in the garden, naked. I surprised myself by joining him. The other day I caught sight of my bottom in the mirror and thought: not bad for 64. There\u2019s a kind of relief in getting older. To expect perfection at this age would be ridiculous. Letting go of some insecurity has made sex newly carefree: I\u2019m still scheduling, but no longer hiding under the sheet. Don, 64 I will often think to myself: only two more sleeps before sex Melissa and I sleep in separate bedrooms because we are light sleepers, but every morning she comes into my bed for a cuddle. The current rule is that once every three mornings that cuddle will turn sexual. I genuinely enjoy the excitement of counting down the days: I will often think to myself, \u201conly two more sleeps before sex\u201d. What we actually do in bed is fairly unadventurous, but I love it. It\u2019s easiest for Melissa to orgasm if she stimulates herself while we are having sex in the missionary position, so we always end up doing that. I enjoy performing oral sex on Melissa, and would like to bring her to orgasm that way, but she has never orgasmed orally. I deliberately don\u2019t pressure her to try, because expectation tends to make her orgasm more elusive. Melissa actually orgasms more frequently now than she did when we were younger. We\u2019ve had 40 years to try out all the positions, and work out what suits us. Melissa has a great body, but I know she is insecure about it. She doesn\u2019t like her breasts, and I try to reassure her by being very vocal about how much I love them. She used to hide her nakedness from me: she would always turn around any time she took her bra off. But I\u2019ve noticed that since retirement she takes more pleasure in being naked. We both do. We spent the summer in the nude in the garden, which is something we never would have done in previous decades. As a rule, I want to have sex more frequently than Melissa. That doesn\u2019t upset me, because she tells me often how much she loves and desires me. Scheduling also ensures my higher libido isn\u2019t a point of conflict between us: sex happens at a pre-agreed time, so it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m repeatedly asking for it and being turned down. There have of course been times when we were in the garden together and I caught sight of her naked body, and longed for spontaneous sex. But ultimately, I think our system works well. Counting down the days makes sex feel more special. Would you and your partner like to share the story, anonymously, of your sex life?",

The prince resumed regular duties this week having taken time off to support his family after the Princess of Wales had planned abdominal surgery. Prince William hosted an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle on Wednesday before attending the London air ambulance charity gala dinner later that evening, thanking the public for their messages of support for the king. Addressing guests at the dinner, he said: \u201cI\u2019d like to take this opportunity to say thank you, also, for the kind messages of support for Catherine and for my father, especially in recent days.

William was expected to take over some engagements as the king\u2019s diary was hastily rearranged and as Catherine recovers at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor. He had said he would return to work only once the princess\u2019s care and recovery had settled. Catherine, 42, is not expected to resume official duties until after Easter.

Police said McIntyre died at the scene and that two people were taken to hospital. McIntyre\u2019s family said: \u201cOur dad, Derrick McIntyre, was a proud dad, husband, brother, son, uncle, grandfather and friend.

        "body": "Sebastian Barry, 68, is the author of 11 novels and 15 plays. Five of his books have been long- or shortlisted for the Booker prize, and his novels have won numerous awards, including the Costa book of the year (twice) and the Walter Scott prize for historical fiction. He was laureate for Irish fiction from 2018 to 2021. His latest novel, Old God\u2019s Time, is about a retired policeman, Tom Kettle, and his struggles with the legacy of institutional child abuse in Ireland. It has been described as \u201ca tour de force of transcendent power and complexity\u201d. Barry was born in Dublin and lives in a converted rectory in the mountains of County Wicklow, Ireland. Was it good to be back in Ireland with Old God\u2019s Time? Did it feel like coming home? I was in dread of coming home. I had spent two books [Days Without End and A Thousand Moons] in America, quite joyously\u2026 a kind of vast holiday. So, yes, it was coming home, but I was a bit\u2026 It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve been avoiding the whole strange cosmos of what we have done to children in this country, but I was certainly unable to write this book\u2026 until I did. When you get past 60, you do feel a sort of licence finally to write fearlessly about something that essentially is full of fear. The book contains some upsetting scenes. Do you have to be in a certain frame of mind to write those? You do. I had reached that frame of mind. It\u2019s not so much about the fact that there was child abuse in Ireland. It\u2019s, what do you do afterwards? How do you live? Because ultimate despair leads to a desire to leave the world. And I feared, as a person who has struggled with depression from time to time, I didn\u2019t want to do anything that was going to dismay me so much that I was going to be sweltering around in my depressive boots, trying to get through the mud. Despite the very different subject matters, this is your third novel in a row that becomes a bit of a page-turner. Where did that come from? It\u2019s a pardon for being a bit older. You think, OK, I\u2019m 68, I have hopefully 20 years. But which bit of that is going to be me just totally crocked, [and] how many years do you have [for] work? And to be alarmed that way is good for your work because you become less self-conscious. But the compulsive element of a book can\u2019t be put in\u2026 I love [that you call it a] page-turner, because that makes me feel it\u2019s its own self-generating artefact, that I\u2019ve managed to faithfully take it from the air through the medium of my stupefied brain. Do you prefer writing novels to plays these days? The last play was On Blueberry Hill, and it got to the West End, which I\u2019d never been to before. I was so excited! Suddenly, Graham Norton wants to talk to you. I found it pretty ravishing, to be honest. But then three days later, they closed the UK [for Covid lockdown] and that was that. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I\u2019ve found theatre very difficult, and I\u2019ve come a cropper a couple of times. [But] I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve completely given up on it. You\u2019re a great reader of your own work. Are you a frustrated performer? Well, that is my performance! I\u2019m not frustrated any more. I actually love reading to an audience. I will work really hard. I know my song well before I start singing, as Dylan said. I even sing any bits of songs that are connected to a book. And the bar is low, as you may have noticed, for writers performing. If you make the slightest effort, everyone thinks that\u2019s grand. In one of your lectures as laureate for Irish fiction, you talked about the thrill of getting a fan letter from Harold Pinter. Has anything matched that since? Yes. Out of the blue, in [2018] in the New York Review of Books there appeared this long article [about Barry\u2019s work] by Robert Gottlieb, who was the centre of American literature. I mean, he renamed Catch-18 to Catch-22. That is sublime editorial intervention. And we never met, but we emailed long emails. And when I finished Old God\u2019s Time I just thought, fuck it, and I sent [the novel] to him in an email. And he had this thing: always get back to a writer within three days, because the writer\u2019s going to be dying. So a few days later came this email of total magic about the book. And it just felt like travel insurance for the experience of [publishing] the book. What explains the renaissance and success in Irish writing recently? It\u2019s a golden age of writing and reading. There are devoted, vocational readers, and that\u2019s very inspirational. That\u2019s generated an atmosphere where writers feel they\u2019re going to be able to get their fish and chips out of this, because there is a receptive thing. You\u2019re sitting there partly going \u201cJeez, you\u2019re such a good writer, I hate you. Can I poison your soup quietly?\u201d That\u2019s part of it. But the other part is, \u201cAh! This is what it\u2019s for\u201d. Claire [Kilroy]\u2019s book [Soldier Sailor] just made me happy and grateful that I existed. Or Joseph O\u2019Connor\u2019s book about the actors [Shadowplay]. Then you have this occurrence of genius, [such as] Claire-Louise Bennett. Did you read growing up? I couldn\u2019t read until I was eight. My sister was reading from the age of four, which was incredibly irritating. My father had a travelling bookcase, and the spines of the Penguin books were on it, row after row after row. I didn\u2019t know what they were, but I knew they were something important. When I finally got a hook on it, I would go with my pocket money and buy a Puffin book every week or two. Where do you write? I work here, in the old study of the rector. I have a stove in the corner, I have my grandfather\u2019s notebooks and some of his paintings. I have my wife\u2019s theatre photograph when she was starting out, so beautiful I try not to look at it. I have a curtain which for some reason has pineapples on it. And I have the poster for Boss Grady\u2019s Boys, which was the first play that did that miraculous thing \u2013 it paid the rent. We didn\u2019t have to hide under the bed any more when the landlord came. Old God\u2019s Time by Sebastian Barry is published in paperback by Faber (\u00a39.99).

        "body": "Alex Kelly leans back in a worn out, ornate armchair. Found in any yiayia\u2019s house, it\u2019s the kind kept in the special living room, reserved exclusively for guests. The chairs are part of Stubborn House, an art installation in Sydney which evokes a very specific look: the diaspora grandparent home. \u201cI think this aesthetic, whatever you want to call it, is completely underrepresented,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThis was our grandparents\u2019 and parents\u2019 attempts to build a place that reconciles the loss of the motherland with the adoption of the fatherland.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just fucking beautiful. I think the doilies are beautiful, the pillars, the red bricks, the pebbles, the concrete. They are all beautiful and deserve celebrating.\u201d Kelly, through his Sydney restaurant, Baba\u2019s Place, has sponsored the installation. Stubborn House\u2019s style is rooted in Australia\u2019s waves of postwar migration from southern and eastern Europe, as well as the Middle East, south-east Asia and north Africa. Intricate and maximalist, these homes are the bridges between the migrant and the diaspora. They are monuments to memories, with walls covered in black and white photos and cabinets filled with old, delicate glassware. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As much as they can, they resemble homes in Lebanon, Greece, Italy or Egypt. These efforts to create safe spaces in a new country have produced a distinctive aesthetic in Australia. Now, the look is threatened on several fronts: by suburban densification and gentrification resulting in some of these homes being demolished or renovated, and by fast furniture and modern design\u2019s insistent diktat that less is usually more. But the artist behind Stubborn House, Gabriella Lo Presti, says this diaspora aesthetic shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as kitsch, outdated or \u201clowbrow\u201d. She sourced wooden doors with frosted glass, Persian rugs, freestanding Tuscan columns and yards of synthetic lace curtains for the show, the last of which she draped over wrought iron fences. \u201cThere is something really beautiful about people being proud of their homes, of skilled migrants building beautiful houses in their image,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are sanctuaries away from the everyday of Australian life and aesthetics, where these families could be themselves.\u201d Lo Presti says migrant stories and design choices reflect the cultural history of Sydney. \u201cI think it\u2019s about time this look is being valued, and that there are conversations on how to preserve it.\u201d Down in Melbourne, similar efforts are under way to preserve and honour migrant home builders\u2019 contributions. Mete Erdo\u011fan and his partner, Georgia Frances King, are restoring a 70s-style federation house (lovingly nicknamed \u201cShag Manor\u201d) in Melbourne\u2019s north and documenting the process on Instagram. They are making meticulous efforts to ensure the restoration honours the legacy of migrants - preserving a home that was partly inspired by a homeland, and partly very Australian. They call the look \u201cFedeterranean\u201d, a mix of federation and Mediterranean, with Erdo\u011fan saying he is keen to maintain \u201cremnants\u201d of his culture and upbringing. \u201cMy parents are Turkish-Cypriot immigrants, and I grew up visiting aunts, uncles and grandparent homes that look a lot like this.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what gives it that really specific look, that combination of elements. We want to pay respect to the materials and attention to detail that people put into building their homes.\u201d Erdo\u011fan admires his forebears\u2019 sense of quality. \u201cOur grandparents ultimately felt these were beautiful spaces; they brought over so much of themselves, and it\u2019s important we recognise these things.\u201d This process of restoration and production is described by Prof Mirjana Lozanovska, from Deakin University, as an \u201cimmense and profound\u201d act of agency. \u201cThese kinds of interpretations \u2026 really shift the narrative,\u201d she says. Lozanovska says the process of defining a style both produced a new Australian identity, while honouring the efforts and journeys of the migrants that created it. \u201c[These migrants] came and lived together, where rent was cheap, and built a new kind of street aesthetic, with larger windows and grape vines or lemon trees.\u201d Younger generations, however, adopt these design choices out of a sense of nostalgia for their grandparents, rather than memorialising the homeland. Lozanovska says Baba\u2019s Place, Stubborn House and Shag Manor all share and celebrate this specifically Australian aesthetic. \u201cThey are not looking beyond Australia to a homeland, which is very significant. They are writing their own histories, their own backgrounds.\u201d Back in Sydney\u2019s Marrickville, at Baba\u2019s Place there are vitrines filled with trinkets and rugs hung on walls, alongside photographs and maps of eastern European and Middle Eastern countries. \u201cThey are new and inventive,\u201d Kelly says of the homes that inspired his restaurant\u2019s decor. \u201cAnd to us diaspora kids, this look represents something stable and comfortable. These were the homes we grew up in.\u201d The restaurant\u2019s food and setting is cross-diasporic. It is not focused on singular thinking about culinary or cultural heritage, bound to a particular \u201chomeland\u201d. This isn\u2019t a Middle Eastern restaurant or a Balkan restaurant. Nor were the installations in Stubborn House rooted in one community or ethnic identity. Instead, Kelly and his contemporaries recognise that the act of migration forges creation: \u201cWe are trying to show those spaces respect, as well as showing who we are.\u201d",

        "body": "Visual art, oddly, doesn\u2019t always translate that naturally to cinema as a subject. Just as you don\u2019t get the full impact of a painting from a coffee table book, the camera can impose a distance from the art at hand \u2013 a secondary perspective that isn\u2019t really needed. Wim Wenders bucks that trend, however, in his marvellous Anselm Kiefer documentary Anselm (Curzon Home Cinema), which feels fully alive to the angular, nature-based textures of the German painter and sculptor\u2019s work. It\u2019s especially exciting as a study of process \u2013 of the grand-scale action that goes into the art\u2019s own dynamic movement. A large part of its reward came, on the big screen, from Wenders\u2019 continuingly imaginative embrace of 3D technology. Now on VOD, the film loses that element but remains engaging for the connection it draws between Kiefer\u2019s own thorny persona and the work itself, and its elegant bridging of the artist with his dramatised younger selves. As a documentary about an artist that makes clear how their vision emerges from their character, Anselm is not as scrappily candid as Jack Hazan\u2019s 1973 landmark A Bigger Splash (Netflix), but belongs in that league just the same. Hazan\u2019s film intimately traces the breakdown of David Hockney\u2019s relationship with former lover Peter Schlesinger over a three-year period, and its effect on Hockney\u2019s work and perspective. It alternates fly-on-the-wall observation with flights of overtly queer fantasy, serving its subject with a fascination that never feels fawning. Corinna Belz\u2019s plainly titled Gerhard Richter Painting (2011) is a more straightforward documentary that nonetheless feels just as illuminating on its subject\u2019s work and sensibility \u2013 largely because it has the patience to stand by and watch as Richter prepares and layers his canvases (the procedural nature of the film proves rather riveting). It\u2019s a relatively rare portrait, alongside those by Wenders and Hazan, of an artist who is famous in their own time. Halina Ryschka\u2019s 2019 doc Beyond the Visible: Hilma af Klint is instead a dedicated effort to elevate the status of a female artist \u2013 the now celebrated Swedish abstract mystic \u2013 who never got her due by the time of her death in 1944. The documentary lacks Af Klint\u2019s own radicalism, but it persuasively makes its case. Other great artists of yore have to make do with the classic biopic treatment, with the same names surfacing repeatedly. Film-makers simply cannot leave Vincent van Gogh alone, for example. Kirk Douglas gave him a tortured brawniness in Vincente Minnelli\u2019s romanticised but unabashedly gorgeous Lust for Life (1956); Willem Dafoe probably came closer to the mark in the recent At Eternity\u2019s Gate, though fellow artist Julian Schnabel\u2019s film was fussily overworked; and the elaborately animated exercise Loving Vincent (2017) simply lets the pictures do the literal talking. (Robert Altman\u2019s 1990 Vincent &amp; Theo, probably the best of them, alas can\u2019t be streamed anywhere in the UK.) Schnabel\u2019s artist\u2019s eye served his subject to more kinetic effect in his 1996 debut, Basquiat (Apple TV), assisted by Jeffrey Wright\u2019s raw, restless performance as the doomed young postmodernist. I\u2019ve always liked the stripped-down emotional volatility of Ed Harris\u2019s Pollock, which captures Jackson Pollock\u2019s stoic masculinity and his mania, and deservedly won an Oscar for Marcia Gay Harden\u2019s seething Lee Krasner. There may be a National Trust beauty to Mike Leigh\u2019s Mr Turner, but it digs intelligently beneath the English complacency that JMW Turner\u2019s canvases raged against. Julie Taymor\u2019s Frida reflected the reckless visual iridescence of Frida Kahlo\u2019s painting, though dramatically it was stodgier stuff \u2013 in sore need of the unbound sensual experimentalism that Derek Jarman so aptly brought to his gilded erotic ode to Caravaggio. Artist biopics are often best off, however, when they take on less obvious subjects. At the intimate end of that scale, I have great affection for Maudie, Aisling Walsh\u2019s tender, tactile study of arthritis-stricken folk artist Maud Lewis, beautifully played by Sally Hawkins. But the daddy of them all is Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s immense Andrei Rublev, a portrait of a 15th-century Russian icon painter that distils a whole national relationship to art, poetry and faith in its one brooding life story. All titles available to rent on multiple platforms unless specified. Also new on streaming Earth Mama (We Are Parable) Savanah Leaf\u2019s gutsy, Bafta-nominated debut feature rests on a stunning performance by Tia Nomore as a pregnant woman in recovery from drug addiction, trying to reassemble her life and her family in the San Francisco Bay Area. It may sound like standard-issue miserablism, but there\u2019s unusual beauty and humour in its worldview. Manodrome South African director John Trengove got much attention for his visceral queer coming-of-ager The Wound. Far starrier but shuffled straight to VOD, his new film also dwells thoughtfully on matters of toxic masculinity, following a young father-to-be (a fine Jesse Eisenberg) submerged into a male libertarian cult. Its observations on incel culture are blunt, but the film does have shivery impact. Night Swim A nice suburban family finds that their swimming pool is haunted \u2013 sure, why not? The latest Blumhouse horror effort mines some pretty stylish jump scares from its silly sounding premise, helped by the allure of its imagery: there\u2019s something intrinsically cinematic about swimming pools, murderous or otherwise.",

        "body": "After American football team the Kansas City Chiefs knocked out the Baltimore Ravens 17-10 to reach the Super Bowl, Alessandra Madrid began shopping for an outfit. Not that Madrid is a fan of the Chiefs, or the San Francisco 49ers, who they face on Sunday. The 32-year-old didn\u2019t check out the official NFL gear for her upcoming Super Bowl shindig. Instead, she went on the hunt for clothes inspired by her favourite artist: Taylor Swift. Ever since Swift began dating the Chiefs\u2019 star tight end Travis Kelce, Swifties have been showing up for the team. Madrid visited TikTok and Etsy and, after swiping past \u201cSwiftie Super Bowl\u201d and \u201cIn My Super Bowl Era\u201d merchandise, she opted for a $46 (\u00a336) red sweatshirt with \u201cSwiftie\u201d stretched across the front and Kelce\u2019s name and jersey number, 87, on the back. \u201cI wanted something a little bit more long-lasting, just in case they don\u2019t win,\u201d Madrid confesses. The sweatshirt is one of thousands of Swift-inspired Super Bowl items available ahead of this Sunday\u2019s big game. With Swifties like Madrid supporting their idol and the Chiefs, many independent merchants have capitalised on the fandom\u2019s interest in the game. One such entrepreneur is Hayley Williams, an Atlanta-based lawyer, who began selling clothing on Etsy as a side hustle. After a colleague suggested hawking merchandise for football-crazed Swifites, Williams initially resisted. \u201cAt first I thought: that sounds too niche to possibly be successful \u2026 I was very wrong.\u201d Since the Chiefs reached the Super Bowl two weekends ago, she says she has sold eighteen \u201cGo Taylor\u2019s Boyfriend\u201d sweatshirts at $35 each. While the world has seen plenty of celebrity-athlete couples, Swift is in an entirely different stratosphere of fame (her music is streamed in America more than the entire genres of jazz and classical). Many Swifties obsess over her life\u2019s smallest details \u2013 such as whether she fixed a chipped tooth \u2013 and her relationship with Kelce is catnip for devotees. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a parasocial aspect to their relationship because they are heavily invested in Taylor\u2019s romantic life,\u201d Lorynn Divita, an associate professor of apparel design and merchandising at Baylor University, says of the megastar\u2019s fans. \u201cThere\u2019s no element too small for them to chronicle.\u201d Over the years, Taylormania has allowed merchants to peddle apparel nodding to the superstar\u2019s life and music. When the 14-time Grammy winner split from actor Joe Alwyn, shirts went on sale that read \u201cWho\u2019s Joe Alwyn Anyway? Ew.,\u201d a reference to a lyric from her song 22. During the first leg of Swift\u2019s ongoing Eras Tour, many concertgoers wore outfits inspired by the singer, including New York University graduation gowns in honour of the commencement address she gave at the school in 2022. As Kelce replaces Alwyn and Swifties look for new ways to show their allegiance, Etsy and TikTok Shop sellers can react rapidly to to such a cultural moment, in ways traditional manufacturers can\u2019t. \u201cThere is no way that they could have anticipated and created merchandise to accommodate this new fan,\u201d Divita says. But some aren\u2019t as enchanted by the singer\u2019s new lover. A few prominent far-right conservatives have lashed out at Traylor, touting conspiracy theories about the authenticity of the relationship. Others have criticised television networks\u2019 NFL coverage, claiming they\u2019re showing more Swift than football (Swift appeared on television for less than a minute of the AFC championship game). Bradley Thomas, a content creator for NBC Sports, says Swift\u2019s association with the NFL is beneficial for the league because she has introduced the sport to new fans. \u201cWhile my wife is married to an absolute sports maniac, she didn\u2019t have the kind of connection with the NFL that I do,\u201d he says. \u201cNow she\u2019s bringing up things about the Kansas City Chiefs that I didn\u2019t even know.\u201d At his wife\u2019s suggestion, Thomas, who also operates an Etsy store, designed his own spin on the Eras Tour official merchandise, selling a T-shirt that reads, \u201cThe Football Era\u201d with a picture of Kelce in a bow and arrow pose and a collage of Swift at different Chiefs games. He also offers shirts that say \u201cKansas City Swiftie.\u201d The Super Bowl has always been a popular merchandising event, with the NFL moving hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods tied to the game. Thomas\u2019s merchandise, like other unofficial gear, exists in a legal gray zone: copyright holders could ask Etsy to take down listings if they infringe upon intellectual property or trademarks. So far, the NFL and Swift have tolerated it. The popularity of Super Bowl clothing tied to Taylor underscores the buying power of long-neglected female sports fans, according to Divita. \u201cSmart teams will hopefully now learn not to overlook that female demographic, because this shows they were just waiting for someone to open the gates for them,\u201d she says. Next season, the league could introduce more Kelce garb to meet fan demand. But if the couple breaks up, independent merchants could rework their Alwyn designs to read \u201cWho\u2019s Travis Kelce Anyway? Ew.\u201d",

        "body": "Follow Jez Butterworth\u2019s compulsive plays and you can catch the drift of the British theatre over four decades. Mojo (1996): zoot suits and snarls; the urban snap of Pinter. Jerusalem (2009): dark and glorious, a lament for, and celebration of, a fraying countryside. The Ferryman (2017): a tribute to the great lift of Irish dramatic writing. Now The Hills of California: part of the slow female-isation of the stage. Last week, Beth Steel\u2019s rousing Till the Stars Come Down showed \u2013 with a great lash of language and velocity of action \u2013 sisters coming together for a disruptive family wedding in their Nottinghamshire home. In Butterworth\u2019s new play, women gather around their dying mother in the Blackpool boarding house where they spent their 1950s childhoods some 20 years earlier. The resort\u2019s pizazz has faded but illusions linger. Butterworth is ingenious about the way fantasy traps and inspires. The house is called Sea View \u2013 which is not true. The rooms are given the names of American states: \u201cI\u2019m going to Minnesota\u201d may mean going to the room next to the lav. Rob Howell\u2019s crammed design \u2013 dark brown bannisters, many lamps and a bar with a tufty straw roof \u2013 captures a sense of stranded hope, but less realism might have suggested more of the wan beauty of the play\u2019s central conceit. This dying mother dreamed of making her daughters into a mini-version of wartime boogie-woogie trio the Andrews Sisters. The girls\u2019 routine, awkward and impressive, is seen and heard in flashback: Sophia Ally, Nancy Allsop, Lara McDonnell and Nicola Turner sing and elbow wonderfully in their apricot uniforms, with alarming shiny stockings, air-hostess hats and tasselled skirts. The dream of stage success is an illusion, which leads to the drama\u2019s main secret and shock, yet the harmonies are real and implant enduring memories: songs are beautifully envisaged as places in which to dwell and hide. Sam Mendes\u2019s production is motored by fine acting from Leanne Best (ravaging hectically), Ophelia Lovibond and Helena Wilson, and by a gleaming central performance from Laura Donnelly, who manages to be apparently all-too-obvious and yet ultimately mysterious: details of what she actually does would spoil the pivot of the plot. The evening unfolds gradually \u2013 the opening scene could do with some of the musical zip that comes later; its pleasures come not from surprises of form or linguistic intensity, but from unexpected observations, social excavation. I love the idea planted here that there is a male category that is the opposite of trophy wives: lumpy or mildly vacant men who potter around doing hobbies and funny voices and have been selected by their women because they elevate them. I love the promotion of the Andrews Sisters, with their disconcerting mixture of attack and seduction: the dulcet quality of their harmonising undercut by the jagged swing of their jaws and hips. It would be hard to claim a place now for some of their calypso renderings \u2013 but bring on more listens to Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy. Lemn Sissay, poetic champion of the outcast, has written a new adaptation of Franz Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis: man turns into a beetle and finds everyone has turned against him. It is directed by Scott Graham, of the physical theatre company Frantic Assembly, who speed their productions with gesture and movement, abolishing the distinction between walking and dancing, between flesh and furniture: they pass bodies to each other in the air like parcels. The combination of talents should be perfect for Kafka\u2019s 1915 novella, but the result is disappointingly stuck and hectoring. How can a play about change move so little? Metamorphosis poses obvious physical challenges for the theatre, but it is rich in interpretative possibilities. Eighteen years ago at the same theatre, with music by Nick Cave and an elastic performance by G\u00edsli \u00d6rn Gar\u00f0arsson \u2013 a member of the Icelandic national gymnastic team \u2013 it effortlessly became a portrait of fascism. Sissay brings his own particular focus: there are thunderous passages about unremitting labour, poverty and whip-cracking officials, but a new fierce emphasis on the experience of being outcast by family. The main character is turned into an adopted child, less cherished than his sister, with whom he has an incestuous brush. Sissay fills the mouth of his hero with ferociously gibbering descriptions of gargoyles, skeleton-headed storks and his mother becoming a lampshade. Simisola Majekodunmi\u2019s lighting throws giant fractured shadows over the faded room on the verge of squalor designed by Jon Bausor. Though Felipe Pacheco never attains full beetledom, he has a bristling moment with chair legs, and increasingly treats the stage like a series of perches, brilliantly balancing on the iron bedhead, hanging upside down from the ceiling, dangling from the light cord. These strong elements don\u2019t fuse or urge each other on. Pacheco\u2019s extraordinary movements take place in the background while speeches are delivered at full roar, like diatribes. The result is not an embodiment of horror but a self-conscious metaphor. The most revelatory moment in Candace Bushnell\u2019s one-woman show comes when she asks her huge audience of Sex and the City fans to guess which parts of the series were based on her own life. Yes: she did go out with a senator. But, no: he didn\u2019t ask her to pee on him. It\u2019s a rare nugget. On stage with a bright pink sofa, and (knowing winks) a shoe closet, Bushnell delivers two hours of screechingly bland self-promotion in a voice as thin as her Manolo Blahnik stilettos, her face rigid with surprise at her surpriseless script. It seems impossible that the evening will pass without one squeak of irony being heard, but so it proves. The bulk of the weightless occasion is made up of a list of the times Bushnell got on to the New York Times bestseller list, self-help injunctions and the weird view that women will be freed by being told to behave like old-fashioned blokes. Bushnell tells us she has \u201chelped change the way the world looks at women\u201d. Not necessarily for the better. Give me the Andrews Sisters any day.

        "body": "Ten years ago, Candida Doyle spoke publicly for the first time about having lived with arthritis since she was a teenager. In a 2014 film about her band, Pulp, Doyle talked about being in denial. It was acceptable for pop stars to have a drug addiction, but not to be ill. Doyle, who plays keyboard for the band, had kept it so well hidden that when a bandmate watched the documentary, her arthritis was news to him. The condition came on when Doyle was 16, a month after her periods started (there is thought to be a connection between hormones and arthritis, though it isn\u2019t very well understood). \u201cIt was suddenly such an extreme difference,\u201d she says, when we meet at her home in north London. \u201cI was just aching all over, I lost my appetite. Going upstairs was difficult, and bending and kneeling was difficult. Then I lived with that discomfort for 30 years.\u201d When she was 17, she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that affects the joints. She was told that the condition would progress and that she might need to use a wheelchair by the time she was 30, an idea the teenager did not take well. \u201cIt was a dark time,\u201d she says. Music helped \u2013 she was into punk, and got into the Undertones and started following them around, going to their gigs. Doyle dropped out of sixth form. \u201cI think because I was living every day and night with discomfort, and I wasn\u2019t that interested,\u201d she says. \u201cI just wanted to date boys, go dancing and see groups.\u201d Almost everyone she knew was in bands \u2013 her brother Magnus was in an earlier Pulp lineup as the drummer and, when their keyboardist left, he suggested Doyle, who had been having piano lessons since she was seven. It was another 10 years before Pulp became huge. \u201cAs we began to rise, it was really, really exciting,\u201d says Doyle. They were on Top of the Pops \u2013 \u201cThe first time was amazing. I was quite drunk, but we were miming,\u201d \u2013 and headlined Glastonbury in 1995. \u201cThat was mind-blowing, almost traumatic,\u201d says Doyle. She was quite introverted and happy to be in the background. Jarvis Cocker, the magnetic frontman, got almost all the attention. \u201cThank God,\u201d says Doyle. Cocker knew about her arthritis, but she didn\u2019t talk about it with the rest of the band \u2013 \u201cI never wanted it to make me different,\u201d she says \u2013 and it didn\u2019t affect her life too much. But when she started to lose movement in her arm, she had to keep raising the keyboard \u201cbecause my arm couldn\u2019t reach down as much\u201d. At the height of Pulp\u2019s fame, life was relentless. \u201cWe worked a lot, we toured a lot. We didn\u2019t have many days off. It came to a point where I just got overstressed and had a huge panic attack on tour. It just got too much.\u201d In 2002, the band took a break. Doyle, then in her late 30s, went travelling for a year. Sometimes her knees would swell and she would have to stay indoors for several days, wondering if she should come home. \u201cI thought no, I\u2019m going to keep going.\u201d A friend had given her a self-help book \u2013 this was long before they were considered acceptable. Doyle felt embarrassed about needing help. She finally read it when she got to New Zealand, when \u201cyou couldn\u2019t get any further away [from the UK],\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cI was approaching 40 and I knew that [the arthritis] would get worse if I didn\u2019t pay it attention. It was becoming visible as well. Going to a shop and getting the change, having to turn my hand, that was getting difficult. I\u2019d noticed some things were getting harder.\u201d Now, she says, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to have straight arms and fingers that can do everything other people\u2019s hands and fingers and wrists do\u201d. Back in the UK, she was inspired by friends who had become counsellors \u2013 and, as part of it, had therapy themselves \u2013 and Doyle trained to become one, doing that for the next 13 years. \u201cI realised thoughts can affect how you see the world or how you see yourself,\u201d she says. \u201cI discovered denial and I thought, \u2018oh right, yeah\u2019.\u201d When Doyle hit the menopause, the discomfort associated with her arthritis virtually disappeared. \u201cI don\u2019t have that constant ache, which is such an incredible relief,\u201d she says. She still does exercises and takes meloxicam, an anti-inflammatory drug. Playing keyboards helps. \u201cI think if I didn\u2019t, my fingers would probably be worse,\u201d she says. Pulp had some gigs last year, and there are more to come. It\u2019s \u201camazing\u201d she says, to be playing together again. Now if Doyle has to play a lot of fast chords, she samples them so can play them using one note, rather than three. It has only been in the last decade that Doyle, now 60, has been able to talk to friends about her condition. Over the years, she has had to work, she says, on how she felt about her body. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of shame. When I go to put a coat on, I can\u2019t just throw it over, it can take a bit of time and I still find that embarrassing. I still don\u2019t like to do that in front of people.\u201d She remembers doing a course on body image about 15 years ago, where she had to draw herself. She drew her arms \u201clike two bits of wood. I felt my arms were like sticks, they didn\u2019t even feel like part of my body. I look back now and think that\u2019s such an awful way to look at yourself.\u201d Getting to a point of acceptance, and even love, of her body has helped a lot, she says. \u201cThe more that I can accept how my body is, the more enjoyable my life\u2019s going to be.\u201d \u2022 For more information visit Arthritis Action",

        "body": "If you were craving a hit of comedy nostalgia, where would you go? Perhaps you\u2019d start with a streaming platform or \u2013 if you find it especially hard to let go of the past \u2013 your DVD collection. But nowadays somewhere else is ready to slake that thirst for comfortingly, familiarly funny TV: your local theatre. Later this month, era-defining sketch series The Fast Show will begin its nationwide stage tour, reuniting the original cast (Paul Whitehouse, Charlie Higson, John Thomson, Arabella Weir) to perform favourite sketches and discuss their memories of working on the show. It joins Drop the Dead Donkey: The Reawakening!, an updated version of the satirical newsroom-set sitcom that ran during the 1990s, which has already set off on its UK tour with most of the original cast. They\u2019ll soon be joined by John Cleese\u2019s stage production of Fawlty Towers, which is getting a five-month stint at the Apollo theatre from May (other 1970s sitcoms recently adapted for the stage include The Good Life and Some Mothers Do \u2019Ave \u2019Em). This autumn, meanwhile, the musical version of Only Fools and Horses, written by Paul Whitehouse and late creator John Sullivan\u2019s son Jim, is set to follow its West End run with a 30-city tour of the UK. In fact, the West End is becoming a home from home for retro British comedy, with Idiots Assemble: Spitting Image The Musical having had a four-month run last year. The transfer of comedy from stage to screen then back again is nothing new (\u2019Allo \u2019Allo! toured from 1986 to 1992, Bottom staged live shows throughout the 90s), yet the sheer volume of high-profile TV-to-stage adaptations doing surprisingly good business in top theatres makes this very much a modern phenomenon. Only Fools and Horses: The Musical might have received middling reviews, but it was a considerable financial success, earning \u00a38m during the first four weeks of its London run. Demand for tickets to An Evening With The Fast Show and Drop the Dead Donkey: The Reawakening! was such that extra dates have already been added. What is behind the boom in shows based on vintage TV comedy? In one sense, it\u2019s merely part of a much bigger \u2013 overwhelmingly huge, in fact \u2013 trend in contemporary popular culture: intellectual property, or IP. This is the tendency for new theatre productions (or TV programmes or films) to take inspiration from a well-known story, character or fictional world. That familiarity makes shows a safer bet, with theatres finding \u201csecurity in the knowledge these will prove popular\u201d, says Caroline Usher-Fox, marketing and communications manager of the Grand Opera House York, which is preparing to stage The Fast Show and Only Fools and Horses this year. The instant recognition factor is extremely helpful for an industry that is notoriously cash-strapped. As Steve Bennett \u2013 who runs comedy website Chortle and has reviewed many sitcom-to-stage adaptations \u2013 explains, theatres are \u201calways looking for existing IPs so people can go: \u2018I know what that is\u2019, and it shortcuts the marketing.\u201d Yet these productions chime with a more specific subset of the IP craze. At the moment, Usher-Fox is seeing \u201c80s and 90s classics sell incredibly well\u201d, with musical versions of Pretty Woman, Sister Act and An Officer and a Gentleman arriving at the opera house this year (musical takes on IP are particularly popular, a fact the Only Fools and Horses and Spitting Image shows took advantage of). That period of pop culture is proving particularly attractive, with comedy from the 70s, 80s and 90s being \u201can especially valuable bit of intellectual property because it appeals to a slightly older audience who\u2019ve got some money to go to the theatre\u201d, says Bennett. As Usher-Fox says, \u201ca thirst for nostalgia and familiarity\u201d is clearly behind the appeal of these shows. With sitcom, that familiarity can run very deep. Cleese\u2019s Fawlty Towers \u2013 The Play stitches together the plots of three episodes (it is seemingly based on a show staged in Australia in 2016), offering a chance for diehards to relive plot lines and dialogue they know off by heart (\u201cIt\u2019s almost like karaoke,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cYou sing along with them\u201d). While the Fawlty Towers stage show will see a cast of young actors taking on classic characters, Dead Donkey and The Fast Show feature the original players, providing an extra layer of familiarity and yet more \u201creassurance they are in for a good night\u201d, says Usher-Fox. It\u2019s worth pointing out that this cosy legacy is not necessarily at odds with the original tenor of these shows: comedy\u2019s ability to provide comfort and reassurance doesn\u2019t only come via a trip down memory lane. David Stubbs, author of Different Times: A History of British Comedy, explains that the element of familiarity is hardwired into many of these comedy programmes. \u201cIt\u2019s often said that comedy is about surprise, but it is also about the predictable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Fast Show, with its catchphrases, was a brilliant exercise in comedy as predictability.\u201d But why not engage in an even more predictable activity by simply watching old programmes at home? One answer is these shows do something the source material can\u2019t: provide an opportunity for connection with beloved performers and creators, and offer an experience of communal fandom and togetherness. \u201cAudiences know they\u2019ll be laughing in unison with a room full of other fans,\u201d says Usher-Fox. something device-based streaming sorely lacks. That highlights another dimension of nostalgia these shows tap into: a longing for the monoculture of yore. Older audiences miss \u201cbig, unifying pop-cultural television events from the days before multiple channels, streaming and the diffuseness of content\u201d, says Stubbs. Nowadays \u201cno comedy show is going to garner the sort of 20 million-plus audiences a Steptoe or Morecambe &amp; Wise did.\u201d Contemporary comedy \u2013 with its emphasis on \u201cinclusivity, nuance, a sense of compassion, depth of character and a certain kindness\u201d \u2013 is quite different from its forebears, especially in tone. Such programmes aren\u2019t always \u201cuproarious, are more esoteric and liable to alienate older viewers who grumble about comedy not being what it used to be, if indeed they come across these shows at all\u201d, says Stubbs. If the appeal for audiences is clear, the attraction for creatives is less immediately obvious. However, it has some connection to the parlous state of TV comedy \u2013 as Bennett puts it, there\u2019s simply \u201cnot much sitcom being made any more\u201d. In fact, in November Ofcom ruled scripted comedy an \u201cat risk\u201d genre for the sixth year running. Sitcom-to-stage shows could be \u201ca way of getting to write something that they can get commissioned and get a go-ahead quite quickly\u201d, says Bennett. \u201cWhereas TV takes forever and there\u2019s not much of it.\u201d Even writers who have earned their stripes with several hits seem to be struggling: Kate &amp; Koji, the last sitcom from Andy Hamilton and Guy Jenkin \u2013 the writers behind Drop the Dead Donkey and Outnumbered \u2013 got poor reviews, and was dropped after two series. And although John Cleese announced last year that he was working on a new television version of Fawlty Towers with his daughter, no broadcaster is attached (the BBC\u2019s head of comedy expressed doubt about the project\u2019s comic potential when asked), and it is unclear whether the reboot will ever go into production. In artistic terms, then, are these stage productions the poor relatives of TV comedy? Despite their box-office successes, they have tended to attract lukewarm reviews, with critics praising the performances and staging but expressing disappointment in the scripts. Some struggle to outshine the originals, yet Bennett thinks the problem is often related to overly high expectations in the opposite sense. Last year he reviewed Idiots Assemble: Spitting Image the Musical, writing: \u201cYou might expect drum-tight material, but much of Idiots Assemble has a first-draft \u2018will this do?\u2019 quality.\u201d Yet that is probably truer to the original programme than we might like to think. \u201cPeople remember Spitting Image as being brilliant when it probably was pretty patchy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou remember all the best bits.\u201d When it comes to the late 20th-century comedy canon, this shift to the stage seems too lucrative to die any time soon. Could it also be coming for gen X and millennial favourites? The naturalistic, mockumentary style of many of the best 00s comedies (The Office, The Thick of It) would certainly make it harder to translate them into big, ebullient stage shows. Yet comedy characters of the era are increasingly returning to theatres \u2013 Alan Partridge did an arena tour in 2022 and Garth Marenghi is now on the road, while Ali G is reportedly destined to join them \u2013 showing there is potential to mine crowd-pleasing live shows from postmodern comedy. It remains to be seen whether their cast and writers will embrace the trend, but it\u2019s perhaps too early to take Peep Show: The Musical! off the table just yet.",

His best work is 2019\u2019s This Is How You Smile, an astonishing, inimitable collection of indie folk, horizontal dance and chillwave with a Latinx edge, wandering free of structure and genre. Endlessly slippery but always engaging, like hearing Arthur Russell play a MacBook instead of a cello. Lange\u2019s Phasor era began with a visit to a synthesiser in Illinois that generates its own music, but thankfully he hasn\u2019t surrendered his creativity to the machines. Phasor is delicately human, mingling digital and analogue imperceptibly under plaintive vocals, coaxing effects and loops to create undimmable warmth. Especially lush are the introspective romance of I Just Want to Wake Up With You (\u201cfloat miles to see your face\u201d, Lange murmurs) and the mysteriously eerie Best for You and Me. At just 35 minutes, Phasor might not be as all-enveloping as his previous efforts, yet it offers enough scraps of melody and moments of wonder that you won\u2019t feel cheated.",

        "body": "Governments should require landlords to reveal the energy performance of homes put up for sale or lease as part of a policy blitz aimed at helping low-income households cut power bills and improve their comfort, according to a report by the Australian Council of Social Service. The report, released on Monday, also calls for a $2bn federal fund and coordinated policies across all levels of government to assist less-advantaged residents tap emerging technologies. They should also follow Victoria by banning new gas connections. \u201cThere are about 1.8m low-income households in Australia who cannot afford to escape extreme temperatures because they\u2019re stuck in inefficient homes that are expensive to warm or cool,\u201d said Acoss\u2019s energy program director, Kellie Caught. \u201cFunding upgrades to make homes electric, solar and climate resilient will reduce poverty, protect against heat-related illness, bring down the cost of power and create local jobs while turbocharging Australia\u2019s emissions reduction targets.\u201d The report noted so-called split incentives \u2013 where landlords had little incentive to help tenants reduce their energy bills \u2013 were impediments holding back renters from improving the efficiency of their homes. Of the 2.4m private rental properties, more than 270,000 housed people on the lowest 20% of incomes. The average energy performance of Australia\u2019s 8m dwellings was also just 1.7 stars compared with the 7 stars \u2013 out of a possible 10 \u2013 required of new residences. Australian homes contribute more than 11% of national greenhouse emissions. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Energy efficiency is often neglected in policy and media discussions even though it is one of the cheapest ways to cut energy usage and emissions, as recognised by the International Energy Agency, among others. While the Albanese government has set up the $1.3bn Household Energy Upgrades Fund (Heuf), it won\u2019t overcome financial barriers for people on low incomes or lend to Community Housing Providers or First Nations community-controlled housing, Acoss said. Jenny McAllister, the assistant minister for climate change and energy, said \u201cthe community sector worked hard over the last decade of climate denial and delay to bring attention to the importance of energy efficiency\u201d. \u201cSmall changes can make an enormous difference in the comfort and cost of cooling or heating a home,\u201d McAllister said. \u201cA total of $600m of commonwealth and state funding will make an enormous difference to the wellbeing and energy bills of at least 60,000 families living in social housing across the country.\u201d Alan Pears, a senior RMIT industry fellow, said the Acoss report was comprehensive and reasonable. \u201cThe challenge is to mobilise governments to act,\u201d Pears said. \u201cMy review of EU progress in housing retrofits showed they have also struggled to drive \u2018deep\u2019 upgrades, which are really what\u2019s needed to deliver health benefits.\u201d Apartment refits, though, created additional barriers, given the mix of owners and renters. Many blocks also often had one external facade, with a lot of glazing and little or no shading, making summer energy performance \u201ca major issue\u201d, he said. CoreLogic, a property data group that has worked with CSIRO to develop artificial intelligence for improving energy efficiency, said a mandatory performance disclosure \u201cshould not be difficult [to introduce] as this is standard practice in many other parts of the world, such as the UE/UK energy performance certificates\u201d. \u201cFrom a market readiness perspective, however, there are some barriers that impact timing,\u201d a CoreLogic spokesperson said. \u201cThese include: lack of market capacity and a nationally standardised processes to assess existing properties and create energy performance certificates for existing homes at scale.\u201d",

        "body": "Twenty-four in 2024 is a series on the lives, hopes and fears of 24-year-olds around the world in a year of election uncertainty, conflict and climate change. Where do you live? I live in Jeonju, South Korea. It\u2019s famous for its traditional Hanok houses, Korean cuisine including bibimbap and its film festival. I used to live with my family, but for the past two years, I\u2019ve been living alone in a studio near my university. What do you do? I major in industrial and information systems engineering. I did my compulsory 18-months military service around my studies, and I have one year to go. I\u2019m learning about production scheduling, quality management and the growing importance of AI and big data, especially related to South Korea. What apps do you use? \u201cKakaoTalk\u201d is a Korean messaging app that every single person uses. No jokes. And a food delivery app\u2026 which might be making me lazy. I\u2019m always on YouTube and might have a slight addiction to Instagram All these short videos \u2026 it\u2019s hard to take a break. What do you listen to? I\u2019m all about K-pop! I lean more towards tunes that aren\u2019t overly upbeat but still carry a certain charm. Lately, I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of tracks by a singer named Yerin Baek. Also highly recommend Square that\u2019s sung in English. What do you eat? I absolutely love traditional Korean food. I\u2019m almost obsessed with kimchi stew, but no one makes it better than my mum. Living alone now, I try to make the dish at home, but a few months ago, a local man started selling it to broke students for just 3,000 won (\u00a31.80; $2.25) right in front of my house! So my home cooking has \u2026 taken a bit of a backseat shall we say? If you come to Korea, come to Jeonju, you\u2019re in for a culinary treat. How do you socialise? My friends and I usually hang out at restaurants or bars. We also have an unspoken rule we bring to every gathering \u2013 \u201cmeme studies\u201d. Memes are an integral part of our identity; we just can\u2019t define ourselves without them, and by \u201cstudies\u201d I mean laughing and having a good time lol. But we also do some serious talking. Since we all want jobs in the corporate world, job-related discussions have dominated recent conversations. It\u2019s something I\u2019m really worried about. What do you wear? Koreans really love their padded jackets, especially those in their 20s and 30s. I have a couple. Winters can be really dry, and in some places, temperatures can easily drop below -10\u00b0C. With the biting cold wind, it feels like your skin could tear apart. My wardrobe is mostly dark-coloured. I also prefer comfortable or oversized clothes. Guys my age hate skinny jeans, and you\u2019ll definitely never catch me wearing them! Tell us about your Saturday If I\u2019m not meeting friends and it\u2019s not cold, I usually start with a light 3-5 km run. I\u2019m not the type to stay at home all day, so after eating, I like to grab the camera my dad gave me when I was younger and go out exploring. I love capturing spaces I find appealing. Then, I like to sit in a quiet spot and listen to music. My friends are going to tease me by asking, \u201cWhen the hell were you ever like that?\u201d but I\u2019m serious. When I\u2019m alone, I tend to do these things occasionally ... haha! How do you relax? Either lying in bed watching Netflix or going out for walks and taking photos. Meeting friends and indulging in yummy foods. But what I really love is travelling, that\u2019s my ultimate way to unwind. I have a special affection for Jeju Island, a short flight away. It\u2019s really beautiful, and I find solace in just staring at the sea there. I\u2019d love to live there someday. What do you want? I want a career. As graduation approaches, I know I need to secure a job.I\u2019d love to pursue a career in production management. But more immediately, what I want most are diverse experiences. Experience shapes us, right? I crave a variety of experiences because they enrich and diversify who I am. What do you fear? Me five years from now. I wonder how I\u2019ll perceive myself then. Even though I\u2019m determined to gain experiences now, I worry if I\u2019ll look back and say, \u201cYes, that was the right path; I did well.\u201d However, since I can\u2019t predict what will happen tomorrow, let alone in five years, I know I need to walk the path I\u2019ve chosen with confidence and give it my best shot. What do you want to tell us? There\u2019s a famous story in Korea about a Buddhist monk called Wonhyo who took shelter in a cave during a rainstorm on his way to China to seek enlightenment. During the night, he was thirsty and drank what he thought was fresh water from a bowl. The next day he realised it was actually putrid water from a human skull, and that the cave was actually a tomb. This torment led him to realise \u201cAll is what comes from the mind.\u201d I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019ve been needlessly anxious about my plans for this year, forgetting this simple truth. What\u2019s next? I\u2019ll continue learning. But I plan to take a break from my studies, and I want to try out a working holiday in Australia. Apart from China and Japan, I haven\u2019t been abroad. What does the world in 2024 look like to you? I hope that in 2024 we can reduce our suffering. I believe that through dialogue with mutual respect, interest in one another, and an open mind, we can alleviate pain arising from various conflicts such as those based on religion, generation, gender, ideology and so on. I guess such actions start with myself, right? Read the full 24 in 2024 series from the Guardian",

        "body": "Whether you relish picking out an outfit and take pride in the smallest details, or prefer not to think about it, putting on clothes every day is a universal experience. Unfortunately, the fashion industry has a terrible habit of making clothes for a limited part of the population. Even though the average Australian woman is a size 14 to 16, many designers do not make clothes in those sizes or larger \u2013 and when they do, they order them sparingly. Sizing is even more limited in the sustainable fashion space, which means looking good and feeling comfortable about your impact on the planet isn\u2019t always possible for everybody. But there are designers and businesses working to change this. Here, fashion industry professionals share their favourite inclusive, sustainable brands. Fit-focused makers Amy Ludvik established her pattern design business, Amy of Melbourne, because she was frustrated by the lack of stylish, size-inclusive, accessible fashion. As a skilled sewer, she makes a lot of clothes for herself: everything from T-shirts to formalwear. When she shops off the rack she seeks out designers who go beyond an expanded size range and really think about the fit of the clothes. Ludvik looks for \u201cfashion that can move and support the body across life and all of the wearer\u2019s adventures\u201d. Her favourite inclusive and sustainable designers are August and Eve, Miskonduct, Chasing Springtime, Embracing Bella, Made590 and Donna Donna. \u201cI also really love the dedication shown by August and Eve to upcycle textiles and reduce textile waste, through their beautiful bespoke garments.\u201d For jeans and trousers, she turns to S\u00dcK Workwear and Cotton On. For size-inclusive underwear and bras, she recommends Curvy for their customer service \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s incredible\u201d \u2013 and Playful Promises because they have a really fantastic range of sizes and styles available for all. Clean, simple and sophisticated Chelsea Bonner, the chief executive of Bella Management, loves comfort and versatility in her wardrobe. She loves anything she can wear both heels and trainers with so it\u2019s easy to change the mood of a look from day to night. She opts for local designers such as Bassike, who are known for their local manufacturing, and Elk, who are champions of responsible materials. Bonner preferences them for their comfortable fits and clean lines. \u201cNo florals or loud colours for me,\u201d she says. When she has to dress up, she turns to the Sydney-based label KitX. \u201cI\u2019m not a shiny, glam feminine type of dresser for any occasion and I love the simple beauty of the fabrics and cuts,\u201d she says. \u201cClean lines and colourways with a twist in the design or print. I like fashion with a little quirk \u2026 but in a subtle or unique way.\u201d For underwear she loves brands that opt for natural materials, such as the Very Good Bra, who are committed to using no plastic in their clothes, and Boody, who work with organically grown bamboo. Design with an edge Lacey-Jade Christie, social editor for LadBible Australia, has several size-inclusive brands she swears by and she says We Are Golden Hour is a plus-size brand to watch. \u201cThe owner, Rhiannon Heritage, has her finger on the pulse of what\u2019s edgy and on trend and isn\u2019t afraid to provide the fat community with designs that most brands shy away from,\u201d she says. \u201cMy current favourites are their mesh tops and their matching sets.\u201d The Melbourne label 17 Sundays is her go-to for denim. \u201cThe team specialise in basics with a bit of an edge,\u201d she says. \u201cI have their jeans in every colour.\u201d And the New Zealand brand Friday Flamingo is her favourite for \u201cbright blazers, sequins and stunning dresses in a bold print\u201d. For workwear and neutrals made from natural fibres, Christie recommends Ecclestone. \u201cThese are ethical designs made with fat people in mind,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favourite item from Ecclestone has to be their tapered trousers in olive.\u201d",

        "body": "The physiotherapist \u2018A simple yoga flow routine will save a world of pain\u2019 Liam Goode, physiotherapist, White Hart Clinic, London Our brains are interested in the easy route and will learn pathways of movement that expend the least amount of energy. This can create imbalances in a joint by overworking muscles in a specific range of rotation. If we want to have healthy joints, we need to combat these repeated movements by keeping our exercise very general. Since nothing in the body is done in isolation, we must build strength across the body. Strength and conditioning programmes are very helpful in engaging all of our muscles and joints, from pilates to yoga, or completing weights exercises in the gym. Find your starting point with the aim of building up to regularly move your joints in as full a range of motion as possible, such as squatting to get your bottom as close to the ground as you can. Ultimately, if the cartilage surrounding our joints doesn\u2019t move enough, it won\u2019t get enough blood flow and it will dry out and crack. The earlier you can build a range of movement into your daily life, the better. If you are in your 20s and reading this, a simple regular yoga flow routine will save you a world of hurt later on. The foot and ankle surgeon \u2018Wear trainers for everything\u2019 Nick Cullen, consultant orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeon, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore When it comes to our feet and ankles, what we wear is really important. Part of my mission is to try to persuade everyone to wear solid, broad-soled trainers for everything. If you have to wear a heel, try to offload your weight better with a lower heel or wedges, since the higher the heel the more pressure you put on the balls of the feet which are very prone to problems. The optimal shoe is structured and lace-up; if you have flat feet, you need arch support for stability and with high-arch feet you need a more neutral running shoe. Asics, Brooks and Saucony are all good brands and I would recommend going to a sports shop with a treadmill to decide which shoes fit your foot shape, even if you never run. It is also important that we get the small muscles in our feet working regularly. You can look up toe yoga exercises on YouTube or while you are sitting, press your toes into the ground and hold for 10 seconds. Lots of people also have tight calf muscles, which puts more pressure on the balls of your feet when you are walking, so make sure to stretch your calf with a towel or scarf looped under the ball of the foot and held tight, keeping your knee straight and pointing your toes towards your nose. The orthopaedic surgeon \u2018Run or cycle to avoid replacements\u2019 Prof Alister Hart, chair of orthopaedics, University College London People often think that running will damage their knees, but over the past decade I have conducted studies with the research group Exercise for Science that have shown how distance running can actually be good for rebuilding the health of middle-aged knees, provided injury-prevention exercises are done beforehand. Non-runners shouldn\u2019t be scared of taking up running, since we haven\u2019t seen evidence of the sport damaging joints further than what might be normally expected by middle age. In fact, exercise as a whole has been shown to improve bone quality in the knee by increasing blood supply and providing muscle strength and definition, allowing the surfaces around the joint to move better. Equally, cycling can be very good for working the knees and hips with its simple, inline motion. Building up to 30 minutes of movement on an exercise bike every other day can really help to reduce the destruction of our knee and hip joints. Even though we have metal joints that we can surgically substitute, nothing quite compares to our own bone and cartilage, so we must look after these joints to begin with. The osteopath \u2018Move every 20 to 30 minutes\u2019 John Mallinder, osteopath, Osteopathy London Movement is central to our health. It is essential to keep us strong and flexible. Even great posture won\u2019t prevent potential stiffness or future joint pain without regular movement. Ideally during working hours, especially if you are seated for most of the day, try to move away from your workstation every 20-30 minutes. Walk for a few minutes, make tea, or have a chat with a colleague. By breaking our routine we can become aware of our posture when we sit again and avoid the negative impact of prolonged periods in one position. If your capacity for movement is limited, during these short breaks you can try some gentle shoulder rolls backwards and forwards, or simple seated spinal twists and side bends, all to a level you find comfortable. If your job is active but involves repetitive movements or extended periods in one posture, explore movements in different directions during these breaks to give yourself balance. Discomfort can often prompt the avoidance of movement for fear of causing harm, but waiting to be pain-free before gently exercising is a mistake, as it leads to slower healing, weakness and vulnerability. Regular, gentle movement should always be seen as part of the solution. Seek advice if you are unsure of what is safe for you. The clinical director \u2018Lean on your arms to help your shoulders\u2019 Anju Jaggi, clinical director of therapies, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore The shoulder is inherently the most unstable joint in the body and relies heavily on muscular structure to offer support and stability. We need to strengthen the muscles that move and rotate the shoulder by exercising our arms regularly and doing things that might seem a bit unnatural, such as weight-bearing with our upper arms. By leaning on your desk while you\u2019re seated or leaning your bodyweight through your arms against a wall for 20 minutes per week, we can build our bone density in the shoulder and allow the joint to better align itself. There is also a strong correlation between grip strength and shoulder strength. If you work on your grip, it will have a knock-on effect for helping your shoulder. Squeezing your hand into a tight fist and then releasing to fan your fingers 10 to 15 times per day is a simple and effective exercise. As we age we naturally stiffen, which is why it is so important to change your behaviour if you aren\u2019t exercising and become more aware of your body so you can identify the areas that might need more attention. The musculoskeletal physiotherapist \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid to slouch\u2019 Aoife O\u2019Meara, musculoskeletal physiotherapist, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore A lot of research has been conducted to show that there is no such thing as perfect posture. In fact, if you spend all day sitting with an upright, straight spine, it causes your back and core muscles to work hard and that can eventually cause pain \u2013 it\u2019s like walking around with fists clenched all the time. Since every body is different, there is no true neutral when it comes to posture. Instead, we should prioritise changing posture every 30-40 minutes when seated and encourage mobility in the spine. It is safe to slouch, since there is no evidence that it will cause harm when you move regularly. Equally, when you sleep there is no perfect position to protect your spine: find what feels comfortable, since it is more important to get a good quality of sleep for your overall health. I often find a pillow between the knees works well for patients. If you are experiencing pain, it is important to listen to your body but also to incorporate movement as soon as you can, because long periods of bed rest are ultimately what becomes most damaging for the spine.",

        "body": "Sofia Coppola has always lived in the kind of cool girl universe where popular culture records your youth for you. Her \u201cawkward\u201d years were captured when she appeared in Sonic Youth\u2019s 1991 music video Mildred Pierce. Her early interest in fashion was immortalised through her cult clothing line Milk Fed. Her ideas about girlhood were explored in films like Lick the Star and The Virgin Suicides. Even the demise of her young marriage to Spike Jonze resulted in the Oscar-winning Lost in Translation. Or take Hi Octane, her short-lived, star-studded Comedy Central series created with her pal Zoe Cassavetes in 1994. In the arms of any other early twentysomething, that description could sound nightmarish. But like so much of the director\u2019s later work, subjects that should be gnawing (the inner lives of the rich, beautiful and bored) are totally hypnotic. To be fair, the show\u2019s watchability is hugely inflated by Coppola\u2019s network of 90s alternative-It Girls. The hosts, Coppola and Cassavetes, get in trouble for goofing off at Monster Truck school before pulling over to offer Keanu Reeves roadside assistance. The model Jenny Shimizu provides mechanic tips (and hints at a previous three-way with Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista). Andre Leon Talley and Beck ponder the mechanics of sex in a car. In another backseat, Good Will Hunting and My Private Idaho director Gus Van Sant predicts the rise of mobile phone cameras. Off road \u2013 and in an alley behind his apartment \u2013 Thurston Moore hosts an appropriately named regular segment called \u201cThurston\u2019s Alley\u201d, where he interviews the likes of Johnny Ramone, Sylvia Miles and Anna Wintour (although she makes him come to her office). Rumour has it Liv Tyler\u2019s appearance was cut. It all feels like a gen X fever dream. Occasionally, Hi Octane does falter. Watching someone else\u2019s cool friends goof off can get old \u2013 even when the cool friends are the Beastie Boys. But most of the time, the format is addictive. A cynic might say any rich, pretty, popular girl in a 1960s Pontiac could make something similarly appealing \u2013 Coppola\u2019s dad did produce it. But amid the chaos there are glimmers of Coppola\u2019s talents and signatures. Her impeccable taste is signalled with a cameo from a pre-Kids Chlo\u00eb Sevigny at an X-Girl fashion show she produces. Hyper-femme aesthetics are explored and teased through Chanel-clad alter egos. At one point, Karl Lagerfeld tells her to enunciate. At the time of production she was five years away from her directorial debut with The Virgin Suicides but her preoccupation with nostalgia, sex and fame are already clear \u2013 as is her unique view into the intimate and casual lives of famous people. It\u2019s not hard to see the warped perspective of The Bling Ring or Marie Antoinette as Debbie Harry gazes at a portrait of herself escaping a (real-life) brush with Ted Bundy. And despite her infamous early foray into acting, Coppola herself shines. Watching her awkwardly attempt to play bass or mug for a fisheye lens, there\u2019s little confusion as to how she became a mainstay of Pinterest boards the world over. Last year Coppola took back the role of record keeper from her many admirers with the publication of her book, Archive. After a career fascinated with other people\u2019s pasts, the book offered an intimate glimpse into her own. Hopefully the trip down memory lane was rewarding enough to inspire plans for Hi Octane season two. Hi Octane is available to watch on YouTube.

        "body": "Walking into The Body Shop was like \u201centering a sweet shop\u201d. It \u201cliterally made your mouth water\u201d, says Stasia Smith-Turpin, who would head to the Lancaster store after school with friends when she was 16 in the 90s. She recalls how a wave of fragrance would hit her as she entered the shop, and she would test and smell the soaps, creams and potions while planning how to spend her pocket money. Smith-Turpin, 48, would spray herself with dewberry perfume \u2013 the scent of summer berries \u2013 before riding the bus home. One day, to her mother\u2019s horror, she applied too much (\u201cmy arms were literally greasy!\u201d) and \u201capparently she could smell me from the bus stop at the bottom of the hill\u201d, she says. Since The Body Shop was founded in 1976, it has served as a gateway to adolescence for generations of young people like Smith-Turpin. Now she and other consumers feel sadness and regret as the retailer collapses into administration in a move that is likely to lead to significant store closures and job losses. \u201cIt was the beginnings of a scented awakening for most teenage girls, and my god did we smell \u2013 beautiful, but really strong,\u201d says Smith-Turpin, now a management consultant in Hampton. But it wasn\u2019t just the products that attracted Smith-Turpin to The Body Shop. It stood for something: ethical consumption, environmentally sustainable ingredients, an abhorrence of animal testing. The store \u201copened my eyes to many of the political issues I still feel strongly about today\u201d, she says. Smith-Turpin bought a book on vegetarianism from The Body Shop around the time she stopped eating meat at 16. \u201cIt was the spark that made me go and find out more,\u201d she says. The Body Shop in the late 1970s represented the height of cool, recalls Helen Gunn, a 64-year-old retired occupational therapist in Herefordshire. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any shops like it at the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember the delicious smells of apple, dewberry and grapefruit.\u201d She also liked how the business, which now has more than 200 UK stores, was a model for women, and how the founder, Anita Roddick, believed natural cosmetics could be feminist. Gunn \u201creally admired the way she ran her business in a male-dominated world. She was a successful woman in an age where it was unusual for women to make headway in any business.\u201d She adds: \u201cI feel really sad that it has foundered.\u201d Roddick eventually sold up in 2006 to L\u2019Or\u00e9al and the company was eventually bought by the private equity firm Aurelius Group last year in a cut-price deal. In 1985, Sally-Ann Fawcett remembers applying for a job at The Body Shop in Scarborough. \u201cThe competition was ferocious,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone wanted to work in such a cool, trendy shop, and the group interview at a five-star local hotel was akin to a beauty pageant.\u201d Fawcett, 56, was gutted not to be hired. \u201cWe were all so envious of those who were successful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really was the place to be.\u201d Every applicant was given a product as a thank you, and she got a banana shampoo. \u201cIt was the start of a love affair that has lasted 40 years since that day,\u201d Fawcett says. Lara Callister, 42, from the Isle of Man, began visiting The Body Shop as a teen in the 90s. \u201cI loved the whole ethos and style,\u201d she says, adding that she was attracted to its strong values of responsible consumption and anti-animal testing stance. \u201cThe actual products themselves were so fragrant and really useful, I adored their morello cherry lip balm, fuzzy peach and dewberry scented products and peppermint foot lotion,\u201d she says. But Callister says she visited less after the chain\u2019s 2006 sale to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, after which it became \u201cbland and uninviting\u201d. She is \u201cvery sad\u201d but not surprised to hear that it has called in administrators. \u201cAsset stripping has been mentioned and it just leaves you with that sinking feeling of another empty shop for the high street,\u201d she says. Hilary Ellis, a 66-year-old semi-retired career coach, lives in Hove, not far from the first ever Body Shop, which opened in Brighton in 1976. At the time it felt like an \u201ceco-conscious emporium of beauty products \u2013 nowhere else had toiletries, cosmetics and wellbeing products under one roof,\u201d she says. The eye shadows were among Ellis\u2019s favourite products \u2013 they were affordable, subtle and cruelty-free \u2013 as well as the essential oils in little glass tubes. Ellis travelled around for work, \u201cso I carried them everywhere,\u201d she says, with the lavender helping her sleep on planes or in hotels. \u201cIt all went downhill when Anita Roddick died\u201d in 2007, Ellis says. \u201cShe was an entrepreneur with a revolutionary ethical approach.\u201d After being sold to L\u2019Or\u00e9al in 2006, the company was bought by the beauty giant Natura in 2017 before its private equity acquisition in 2023. Ellis believes now is the time \u201cwe need someone to make a fresh start for affordable ethical beauty on our high streets\u201d.",

        "body": "It\u2019s rare for intense sexual chemistry to last. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it enough,\u201d says the relationship therapist Cate Campbell, \u201cbut it\u2019s very normal for attraction to wane in a long-term relationship, especially as people get older and bodies change. Even if you love and care for your partner, you may fantasise about other people or wish they were younger or fitter. Mother nature tricks our brains into only seeing the positives when we start dating, but that wears off over time.\u201d Some people find that loss of sexual connection is a dealbreaker, especially when it\u2019s accompanied by other problems in the relationship. \u201cIf couples get out of the habit of being intimate,\u201d Campbell says, \u201cit can make them more critical of each other\u2019s flaws.\u201d But it is possible to keep love alive, and even reignite that sexual spark. Communicate openly According to psychotherapist Kamalyn Kaur, nothing is more important in relationships than old-fashioned communication. \u201cIf you find the sex is missing, have an open conversation about it. Try bringing it up in a non-pressurised environment \u2013 like when you\u2019re walking or cooking together. This creates a bit of space so you don\u2019t have to answer questions right away.\u201d Taking the time to think about what\u2019s caused the physical rift helps couples engage with what\u2019s going on, and consider other forms of intimacy. It\u2019s something that worked for Claire, 36, who has been with her partner for 10 years. \u201cWhen the sex went from our relationship a couple of years ago, we talked about it openly,\u201d she says. \u201cHe told me that he didn\u2019t fancy me, and I appreciated his honesty. We got together after running a business together so we\u2019d never had that intense honeymoon period. Our relationship was built on mutual trust and enjoying each other\u2019s company, but it got harder during Covid because we had the stress of trying to keep the business going.\u201d They separated briefly, but soon realised they didn\u2019t want to be apart. \u201cUltimately, we are partners in life and have always supported each other in everything. For me, being able to have honest, open communication in a life you\u2019ve built together is more important than sex.\u201d Share your memories and achievements With so much history behind them, Claire found that focusing on their memories and achievements strengthened their bond. \u201cOur relationship is based on achieving things as a team. To support that love, we\u2019ve continued being intimate in other ways, such as hugging, sharing a bed and spending quality time together outside work.\u201d After two years without sexual contact, the intimacy between them is starting to grow. \u201cIt might come back even more when our child leaves home later in life. But for now I appreciate what we have, how well he treats me, and how he supports me through mental health challenges. People think the grass is always greener, but it takes time to build lasting intimacy and I don\u2019t want to throw all that away.\u201d Kaur agrees that celebrating milestones can be a fantastic way to stop partners from taking each other for granted and recognise the evolution of their relationship. \u201cIt can be anniversaries or things you\u2019ve achieved as a couple, such as having children or buying a home together. I recommend writing these things down because it encourages reflection and it helps to build positive memories. You can also try writing down your partner\u2019s best qualities to remind yourself why you were drawn to them in the first place.\u201d Tackle the weak spots in your relationship Unlike food and shelter, sexual chemistry isn\u2019t No 1 in the hierarchy of human needs. Relationships coach Katarina Polonska, who specialises in supporting high-achieving couples, says that grappling to achieve the \u201cbig ticket\u201d items in life, such as a good career or building a home, can mean people deprioritise their partner, leading to a loss of sexual interest. \u201cTo feel in love after the honeymoon period is a choice \u2013 it\u2019s not something we can expect to last,\u201d she says. \u201cTo make that choice, we have to make room to feel desire and love. The first thing I ask couples when they\u2019re losing desire for each other is whether there are any other stressors in their life, such as work or caring duties.\u201d For couples who identify this as a problem, making more time for each other can help them reconnect and regain that sexual chemistry. \u201cAnother common reason that people stop fancying their partner is due to past resentments and unresolved relationship issues. These can be tiny microaggressions, but over time they grow into something bigger.\u201d She recommends that couples take at least 30 minutes each week to try the \u201cthree things\u201d exercise. \u201cYou share three things you appreciate and three things you need the person to know, for example times you didn\u2019t feel seen or heard, or something that has rocked your trust. Then you share three things that you need, such as acts of romance or help around the house. It\u2019s important not to judge, but give each other space to share.\u201d Build an intimacy routine Intimacy is often associated with sex, but Campbell points out that it can be so much more than that. \u201cTo keep a loving relationship going without sex, it\u2019s important to build an intimacy routine, for example hugging and kissing before you go out. Sometimes applying a sex ban can be helpful to take the pressure off completely and see what happens when you try holding hands or just cuddling on the sofa.\u201d She adds that if partners still care about each other, spending quality time together is likely to improve the relationship, and those feelings of sexual chemistry could return \u2013 even after years without it. For some couples, practising intimacy exercises can bring them closer together. Clinical psychologist Dr Patapia Tzotzoli says that mindfulness during intimate moments can help to rebuild attraction between couples. \u201cHugging meditation involves taking a deep breath and visualising your partner 200 years from now. This mental exercise helps people to appreciate that life is precious and enables them to cherish what they have right now.\u201d Through the simple act of staying in the moment, couples shift their attention back to each other and their relationship. \u201cIt can help them to replace the negative feelings with more positive ones and make them more able to interact with each other with kindness and patience.\u201d Try something new One of the reasons that attraction between couples can dwindle is the lack of variety. The mundanity of day-to-day life, coupled with the stress of working can leave little time for excitement. Tzotzoli recommends taking up a new hobby or trying something different. \u201cBy focusing on personal growth, you\u2019re nurturing your own sense of fulfilment. It can enrich each partner\u2019s individuality, which will contribute positively to the relationship.\u201d Over time, that renewed sense of self can lead to increased attraction and appreciation for each other. She also suggests trying new activities as a couple, such as dance classes, cooking classes or anything else that pushes you out of your routine. Some names have been changed",

        "body": "Once, it was simply called Christmas. But then the Ghanaian government declared 2019 the \u201cyear of return\u201d, inviting African Americans to come home, and Detty December took hold. Africans, British-Ghanaians and those from the wider diaspora soon joined in and the idea exploded into a spectacular annual ingathering, which necessarily means music, parties and cultural conversations everywhere, all the time, vibe on a rolling boil. The largest event is AfroFuture, a two-night stadium festival that attracts more than 40,000 attenders, and it is here I meet the vocalist Black Sherif following a luminous, incendiary headline set. Though a key part of the Afrobeats phenomenon \u2013 the continent\u2019s biggest star, Burna Boy, was so wowed by his track Second Sermon that he demanded to feature on the remix \u2013 Blacko, as he is affectionately known, is not an Afrobeats artist. \u201cHis music is a bridge between the younger and older generation,\u201d says Nana Kwasi Wiafe, creator of the Very Ghanaian brand and stylist on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Black Is King. \u201cHe carries the authentic sound of Ghana, highlife, merging it with the modern sounds \u2013 drill, reggae, rap \u2013 that inspire him.\u201d Though categorisation melts anyway as soon as Blacko sings, his voice clear, urgent and transporting whether in Twi or English. That voice has ensured him considerable recent success, including performances at the Mobo awards, Wireless festival and a BET award for best international flow, and he\u2019s now forging further links with the UK \u2013 his new single features British pop singer Mabel and in a few days he\u2019ll walk at London fashion week. It feels incredible, he says, \u201cunderstanding the influence my craft has on people all over the globe\u201d. Born Mohammed Ismail Sharrif, Blacko hails from Konongo-Zongo, a mining community in Ghana\u2019s gold-endowed Ashanti region. When he was 10, his seamstress mother left to work in Greece (\u201cI felt a part of me was missing \u2013 I miss my mother so much to this day\u201d) and his peripatetic childhood thereafter informs his vivid, visual storytelling. \u201cI try to be 100% vulnerable,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting stories together don\u2019t be like a big fight because I just say whatever happened, making it a bit more dramatic. Every time I\u2019m writing music, I\u2019m writing a play. I call it \u2018drama in a voice pipe\u2019.\u201d The protagonist of which is almost always him, examining his failings, most famously in signature track Kwaku the Traveller. \u201cOf course I fucked up!\u201d he sings. \u201cWho never fuck up? Hands in the air \u2026 no hands!\u201d On another track, Yaya, the lyric \u201cI\u2019m illegal in my own town, in my own city\u201d is a cry of alienation. In working through his struggles without shame, Blacko \u2013 also a University of Ghana psychology student who confesses he doesn\u2019t have \u201ctime to go to class\u201d \u2013 legitimises the same feelings in listeners who may otherwise be disinclined to turn their gaze inward. On recent single January 9th, released for his 22nd birthday, he sings a lullaby to himself: \u201cPain in my heart but I\u2019m doing just fine.\u201d Just as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Break My Soul has her \u201csleeping real good\u201d as an act of resistance, Blacko celebrates the hard-won ordinariness of being all right \u2013 particularly valuable following Black Lives Matter and during a male mental health epidemic. On another recent single, Fallen Angel, he voices both halves of a gorgeously harmonic, philosophical and intimate dialogue with himself: \u201cYou go be a slave to your flaws / Will you stay on the floor? / I wanna see you at the top \u2026 one thing I\u2019ve learned to do is to take care of my people, that is all I want for you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s created with a big red love,\u201d says the track\u2019s producer, Smallgod. \u201cIts message comes from a deep place in Blacko\u2019s spirit and resonates with everyone whether religious or not. Everyone is looking for that light.\u201d For all the pain, the dominant theme in Blacko\u2019s work is hope: warning people of life\u2019s pitfalls before suggesting ways to combat them. \u201cHe\u2019s so pure at heart,\u201d says Smallgod, \u201cand very particular about where he goes, where he stays, and what he does. And he\u2019s very smart at the age of 22 \u2013 too smart for that age. Some people don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing and they expect you to teach them \u2013 but he knows everything.\u201d Because his demeanour \u2013 warm, gentle, joyful, genuine \u2013 fits with the Ghanaian character, people seem to love Blacko the bloke as much as Blacko the artist. \u201cI feel this!\u201d he says. \u201cI keep myself as real as I can. I try to make people\u2019s days.\u201d So he pays food bills for street kids and maternity bills for impoverished women, also taking time to advise the many younger versions of himself he encounters. \u201cI speak to them like I\u2019m speaking to my peers,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause they need to know it\u2019s not always sweetness \u2026 it doesn\u2019t get easier. I be real to them, tell them about their struggles, everything, I tell them: \u2018Look at me, keep going.\u2019 Love it!\u201d Live at AfroFuture, though, it\u2019s all positivity, Blacko showing that he can dance as well as sing. He closes the show with a mantra \u2013 \u201cOil in my head, everything I touch is blessed, all I see is blessings and no man can stop this\u201d \u2013 repeated over and over with the intentionality of a preacher, crowd duly hollering it back in unison. \u201cSometimes I make music and describe it with colours,\u201d he says, \u201cand Oil in My Head is white and blue because it just feels refreshing. Any time I play it I go outside and act it, because it\u2019s a prayer. I manifest in Oil in My Head, appreciating I\u2019m anointed. Everything I touch with a clean heart is going to turn gold.\u201d",

        "body": "\u2018This next song is a love song. I know! She does those?\u201d Laufey is softly backlit, with a cherry-red electric guitar strapped over a white blouse, and despite her wry humour she\u2019s about to perform another dreamily romantic song from her second album Bewitched, which last week won the Grammy for best traditional pop. Blending jazz and classical influences into pop to tell retro, soft-focus fantasies full of \u201cwine-stained lips\u201d, handsome strangers and heartbreak, even Laufey\u2019s most cynical songs are cinematic romances. On Dreamer, the 24-year-old claims to quit dating for good \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m throwing in my hat / I can\u2019t take another lifeless little chat!\u201d \u2013 yet the airy arrangement adds a theatrical wink, as if it\u2019s the scene before the Hollywood heroine is finally swept off her feet. Since her 2021 debut, the classically trained Icelandic Chinese musician has been somewhat patronisingly praised for \u201cintroducing\u201d jazz to gen Z. This downplays Laufey\u2019s talent for pop storytelling and underestimates her fans; tonight\u2019s sold-out crowd reverently sing along with her unusual, honeyed contralto and scream for cello solos with the vigour usually reserved for a pop show\u2019s confetti cannons. With lounge-singer poise, Laufey floats through bossa nova single From the Start, performs the syrupy Best Friend as a skit with her violinist twin sister and chases early song Like the Movies with a hint of jazz standard Misty. Her self-proclaimed \u201cold-fashioned\u201d ways can soften her songs to a fault, but a heavier rendition of Lovesick punctures the lull, bringing fresh energy and possibly a sign of future experimentation. \u201cMy younger self didn\u2019t believe in herself as much as she should have,\u201d Laufey admits, introducing Letter to My 13 Year Old Self as a gentle victory lap. Alone on stage, without the record\u2019s strings, Laufey sings as if she\u2019s looking in a mirror. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll be up on stage, little girls will scream your name,\u201d she croons, as her fans do just that, fulfilling her daydream like a Broadway chorus line. Then she ad libs, with a full grin: \u201c... and you\u2019ll win a Grammy!\u201d Of all the night\u2019s romances, this quiet ballad is the real fairytale. \u2022 Laufey is at Albert Hall, Manchester, 14 February; Earth, London, 15, 16, 17 February, then on tour in Europe and the US",

        "body": "The English National Opera season continues with a revival by Peter Relton of Jonathan Miller\u2019s 1987 staging of Rossini\u2019s great comedy of love, class, money and manipulation, still a wonderfully engaging piece of theatre nearly four decades after it was first seen. The multiple casts that have come and gone over the years have inevitably resulted in shifts of emphasis and sometimes mood \u2013 some of its past outings have felt fractionally more barbed than on this occasion. It remains marvellously witty and astute, particularly in its depiction of a world where everyone seems to be on the make, but we\u2019re now less immediately aware, perhaps, of the grotesque, slightly sinister way which Dr Bartolo (Simon Bailey) immures Rosina (Anna Devin) in a house full of specimen jars and barbaric-looking medical equipment. And in the past, the ending was sometimes more ambiguous in suggesting the consequences, familiar from Mozart\u2019s Marriage of Figaro, of Rosina\u2019s eventual marriage to an aristocrat she has only ever encountered in successive disguises, and therefore never really known or understood. The cast this time around is really lovely, though, a fine ensemble, well balanced and superbly integrated. Charles Rice\u2019s excellent Figaro dominates, as he should, handsome of voice and presence, with mocking irony and glee never far from his tone, a man with his eye to the main chance, wordly wise and affectionate. Devin, a soprano Rosina rather than the more usual mezzo, is very much his equal, confounding him with her cunning, and braving Bartolo\u2019s threats with supreme unconcern. The ease in her upper registers and her coloratura are striking, too, particularly in the lesson scene. Bailey, meanwhile, blusters, rages and can be very funny, though his absurdity also keeps us just the right side of empathy: his aria is superbly done, the words clear and telling in the central patter section, where they can all too frequently blur. Innocent Masuku makes an elegant, bright-toned Almaviva; Alastair Miles\u2019s Basilio sounds good in his calumny aria; and Lesley Garrett, who sang Rosina in this production 25 years ago, now has great fun as Berta, the frustrated housekeeper with the hots for Bartolo. Roderick Cox conducts a taut, energetic account of the score with some exactingly precise playing. It\u2019s a most enjoyable revival \u2013 and an excellent tonic for those February blues. \u2022 Until 29 February.",

        "body": "My husband and I have been together for 23 years, and it is definitely the regular little things that keep us reminded of each other\u2019s affection. I am usually up first, and always take him a coffee in bed; at night, I always go into the bathroom and find my toothpaste on my toothbrush. When we walk to our local cinema, I notice that he stands back to let me go first where the footpath narrows and he always deseeds the tomatoes because he knows I prefer them that way. Samantha Briggs, project manager, Somerset Before we became a couple, I regularly used to write my (now) wife\u2019s name on the steamed-up shower screen which, looking back, seems a little teenage obsessive. Now married, having been together for five years, I continue to do it every morning with a love heart next to it, so that whenever she goes in the bathroom after me she feels remembered and loved. Ed, Guernsey My husband bought me an umbrella with a lifetime guarantee before I set off to work in London. He researched one which opened and closed easily, with a sturdy handle, in my favourite colour, and which fitted in my favourite handbag. It\u2019s truly been the most understated present that I\u2019ve received. Every time it drizzled I\u2019d reach for my trusted brolly and feel loved and cherished. Ketvi, Sydney, Australia My husband picks out and saves the whole peanuts from bags of salted peanuts, because he knows I like them. It sounds a bit silly \u2013 me liking whole peanuts that taste the same as half peanuts \u2013 but he picks them out anyway and this small gesture feels very romantic. Sharon Evans, church administrator, Bedford Whether reading or sleeping or watching TV in our king-size bed, our personal territories are well defined. So an occasional, gentle, fleeting footsie tap says \u201chey, babe\u201d. While a conventional cuddle would be nice, his body temperature is so high that after five minutes I break out in a sweat and we are both reduced to giggles. A footsie sends the message, no sweat. Michael, Atlanta, US My partner is not one for romantic gestures really, but he is always doing the small things for me. This past weekend I absent-mindedly mentioned my car was low on screenwash, and while getting ready this morning (he leaves earlier than me) I got a text saying he topped it up before he left. He is always checking on my car to make sure it\u2019s in perfect shape so that I never have issues. Samantha Morrison, research analyst, Ottawa, Canada My husband can basically eat what he wants, whereas I have to work harder to stay in shape. When he makes cheese on toast, which I love, but I\u2019m having a sad salad, he\u2019ll sprinkle the crispy bits of cheese that fall into the grill pan on to my lunch when I\u2019m not looking because he knows I love them. I do and I love him for it. It\u2019s the little thoughts that make a big impact. Rachel, Hertfordshire Whichever one of us is the first one to go to bed, we lie on the other\u2019s side of the bed. Then when the second person comes to bed, their side is warmed and ready for them. Then the first person goes back to their own (cold) side. We both do this nice gesture for the other, and gain pleasure from giving and receiving. RDG, retired, US My girlfriend and I live on different continents and we send each other a voice note for the other to wake up to the next morning. Usually it\u2019s just some rambling about what we\u2019ve been up to or encouragement for what the other has on that day, but waking up and hearing her voice tell me she loves me first thing makes me feel so connected to her, despite her being miles away. Daisy, sustainability charity worker, London When I used to work night shifts in a hospice, I was always passing my husband going to work as I arrived home exhausted but, when I got into bed, I often found a freshly prepared hot-water bottle there. That used to make me so happy. Fiona, nurse, Cumbria Every Thursday, I drop off my daughter at ballet and, on the walk home, I buy my husband a spring roll from the Chinese takeaway across the road. These are his absolute favourite but he never seems to expect it \u2013 he always seems surprised. Pamela Bilo, Gloucester I like to leave little cards in my wife\u2019s bag or desk at work. Sometimes it takes her weeks to find them. Some are handmade, some are bought; it\u2019s a tradition that goes back to when we were first married and I had to go away for a week for work (the longest time we\u2019ve ever been apart) and I sent her a card every day. I\u2019m crap on the phone, so prefer to write love notes! Theo, teacher, La Nuc\u00eda, Spain Perimenopause has been just awful \u2013 the hot flashes have been sudden, overwhelming and almost stop me in my tracks. My extremely sweet and considerate partner has developed a tactic for when one hits: as soon as he notices my distress he surreptitiously blows a stream of cool air into my face or neck. He doesn\u2019t draw attention to himself while he does this either, and the cool air makes a huge difference. It means I can stay at the table with friends, keep watching a show or cope in a shop. Emma, the Netherlands My husband started giving me pedicures in front of the TV when I was pregnant with my daughters and couldn\u2019t reach my feet myself. Twenty years on, he still isn\u2019t afraid to get his hands on my Frodo feet and takes care of my toes weekly while we watch Only Connect. What a man! Cathy Charman, executive assistant, London Every time I buy my wife a book, I make a wee bookmark for her to use with it. It\u2019s always got something to make her smile on it \u2013 a love token instead of a book token. She gets them out from time to time to remember where we were and what we were doing when she read a particular book \u2013 she\u2019s kept the bookmarks, even when she\u2019s disposed of some of the books. Brian, retired, Dorset My husband once bought me a toaster for Christmas. Previously, we had a toaster from Sweden, designed to take Swedish-sized slices of bread, which are about two-thirds the size of a UK slice. Every morning, I would groan about the top third being un-toasted. In buying me a new toaster (with a bagel setting!) my husband saw it less about the toasting of the bread and more about the removal of one of life\u2019s little annoyances. When I look at my toaster, I feel very loved and understood. Victoria Harris, Dorset I\u2019m quite a self-conscious person, so if I trip over while walking down a busy street, my partner will purposely trip in a comical and over-the-top Basil Fawlty way to \u201coutdo\u201d me, and it makes me laugh every time.

        "body": "The biggest story of the year so far in games has been Palworld, the \u201cPok\u00e9mon-with-guns\u201d early access game that broke and rebroke concurrent player records on PC. It\u2019s showing a few signs of being unsustainable, as those player numbers have dropped off in recent weeks and the developers reveal the eye-watering cost of keeping servers online for so many people (almost $6m a year), but it\u2019s still in with a shot of being 2024\u2019s biggest game in terms of pure revenue. There\u2019s something a little unsavoury about Palworld that has other developers and critics wrinkling their noses. It\u2019s not just the ick of turning guns on creatures that are, unlike Minecraft\u2019s blocky animals, designed to look cute. Its character designs are so close to Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s that it has sparked allegations of plagiarism, with some 3D models of the game\u2019s creatures aligning improbably closely with those from recent Pok\u00e9mon games. (The Pok\u00e9mon Company is investigating, while Pocketpair\u2019s CEO, Takuro Mizobe, said that Palworld \u201ccleared legal reviews\u201d, and that the studio has \u201cabsolutely no intention of infringing upon the intellectual property of other companies\u201d.) Its lead developer has also been cheerfully outspoken about using AI tools, which is a super-unpopular opinion among everyone who works on games in 2024, except certain company executives. The game also borrows ideas from several other ones without bringing all that much of its own to the table. It\u2019s not Pok\u00e9mon that comes to mind as you play Palworld, but Ark: Survival Evolved \u2013 a nine-year-old survival game that has you taming dinosaurs, alongside the usual gathering, building and crafting. Once you\u2019ve captured a creature it is pressed into indentured servitude on your base, or comes along to battle with you out in the wilds. There is nothing here that you haven\u2019t seen in several other survival games, but Palworld makes it totally frictionless, removing a lot of the busywork between you and the next shiny upgrade. Like Genshin Impact, also an enormous hit, it takes familiar game tropes and makes playing so easy and compelling that it\u2019s hard to put it down. It helps that there are no other players trying to ruin your fun, as there are in Ark, or Rust, another survival game in which there\u2019s always someone ready to smash you with a rock and take your stuff. Player v player competition doesn\u2019t currently exist in Palworld (it\u2019s planned for in later versions); instead, you cooperate with other players on a server. The game\u2019s attitude to its creatures is cutthroat \u2013 they exist to be killed, enslaved or eaten \u2013 but its attitude to players is very welcoming. There are reasons it\u2019s so popular. Nonetheless, I find Palworld hard to like. It\u2019s soulless, and anecdotally appears to have a lot of kids in its 19-million-strong player base, when this is not a game made with children in mind. Compared especially with the Pok\u00e9mon games from which its creature design draws such obvious inspiration, it is violent and amoral. In Pok\u00e9mon, a children\u2019s classic that has evolved over 25 years, your creatures are companions, not just pets but friends. You battle them for sport, sure, which is not something Peta would approve of, but they don\u2019t get hurt, there are no weapons and you certainly don\u2019t eat them. Palworld is closer to what panicked parents and reactionary preachers of the late 1990s thought Pok\u00e9mon was like, back when Time Magazine was running scaremongering features headlined Beware of the Pok\u00e9mania and Christian organisations were arguing that Pikachu was a literal manifestation of Satan. \u201cMonsters make for disquieting playmates. No matter how toylike and frivolous they may appear, monsters are unnatural and, in the end, deal in unresolved fear,\u201d opined Time, in 1999. \u201cBut monsters also have a way with children. Consider the suspicious charms of the Pok\u00e9mon creatures \u2026 The four-to-12-year-old set can exhibit the most troubling fanaticism about Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d It is laughable to read these lines now, but I remember when this was the tone with which video games were always talked about in mainstream media: as a symptom of some deep spiritual sickness in children of the 90s. Anyway, I\u2019m not here to start a moral panic about Palworld \u2013 it\u2019s cynical, but it\u2019s also mostly harmless and undeniably compelling. I wouldn\u2019t let my seven-year-old play it, but anyone over 12 will have seen worse on YouTube. Perhaps there is nothing new under the sun, and the majority of breakout games from here on out will be repackaged ideas we\u2019ve seen 10 times before. But I remain hopeful that the next unexpected hit I play this year will leave me with a smile, rather than an unpleasant taste in my mouth. What to play It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, so I must recommend a game about love, a topic that many games do not confidently tackle. Dream Daddy is a dating game in which you play a single father looking for love with one of seven other eligible single fathers in your new neighbourhood. Before it came out in 2017, many thought that it would be an overdone joke, but it remains one of the most sincere and unexpectedly touching dating games around. Your teen daughter often helps you work up the courage to talk to your dad of choice, and it frequently segues into gently surreal mini-games where you, for instance, try to dazzle your date with competitive pride in your kids\u2019 achievements. It turns out to be a game about the love between parent and child, as well as the budding romances between you and the hot neighbourhood bachelors, all of whom have their own problems and stories that are handled with humour and compassion. Available on: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PC and smartphones, Estimated playtime: 2-10 hours, depending on how many dads you want to date What to read We are still waiting for Microsoft to outline its vision for the future of Xbox: it\u2019s happening tomorrow evening,UK time, via a podcast featuring Xbox executives Sarah Bond, Phil Spencer and Matt Booty. It comes as recent research from 2K Games suggests that the PS5 has outsold the Xbox Series X by two units to one. I loved Gene Park\u2019s feature about the Yakuza series on the Washington Post, titled \u201cA Japanese crime game series wins hearts with kind, heroic masculinity\u201d. It gets to the heart of the appeal of these games, for anyone without the tens of hours spare to play them. The British maker of Jagex, the company behind Runescape, has been bought for \u00a3900m by a pair of private equity firms. Disney has invested $1.5bn(!) in Epic Games as part of a deal to create a \u201cnew persistent universe [that] will offer a multitude of opportunities for consumers to play, watch, shop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and more\u201d. Sounds like that means more than a few more Star Wars skins in Fortnite.

Question Block This week\u2019s question comes from Rosie from New Zealand: What games for the Switch do you recommend for a mature teen who plays the likes of Dead By Daylight, Left for Dead, Hitman and Red Dead Redemption on PC? I do love the Switch, but it\u2019s not great for teens (or adults whose inner child is less close to the surface). A combination of its family friendly reputation and lesser power compared with the Xbox and PlayStation leaves it lacking in purely adult-oriented games, whether that\u2019s muliplatform staples such as Call of Duty or the PlayStation 5\u2019s exclusives in the vein of The Last of Us and God of War. That said: the original Red Dead Redemption is on Switch now, and Metro Redux is a duo of interesting post-apocalyptic shooters that holds up well. If they are interested in something more fantasy-flavoured with exciting combat, they may also enjoy The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt or Dark Souls. For old-school shooter/horror vibes, there are also Bioshock and Resident Evil collections on Switch. Most of these games are rereleases or remakes: alas, the latest multiplayer shooter or horror games are not to be found on this console, but you\u2019ll easily find them on PC.

        "body": "Ever since Netflix declared the return of the moribund studio romcom with its \u201cSummer of Love\u201d in 2018, the company has churned out a steady stream of formulaic \u2013 or, to quote the burn in many a review, \u201calgorithmic\u201d \u2013 at-home fare. The genre didn\u2019t so much reboot as mutate for a new streaming home with a now distinctive style: baseline watchable, sheen-y, disposable. I\u2019ve reviewed probably a dozen of them and can only recall a handful. The few that have stuck \u2013 To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before, Set It Up \u2013 have endured in large part because of its stars\u2019 charisma, without which a romcom has little hope. Such was the case with 2019\u2019s Someone Great, a middling movie elevated to memorable by the breezy charm of Gina Rodriguez. The erstwhile Jane the Virgin star has a natural affinity for the romantic lead: megawatt smile, puppy-dog eyes, caffeinated energy, a preternaturally sunny presence striking the highly prized sweet spot between gorgeous and relatable. She is deservedly the main attraction of Players, a new Netflix romcom released on Valentine\u2019s Day starring Rodriguez as Mack, a Brooklyn-based sports journalist looking to up her playbook of romantic entrapment. As with Amazon\u2019s concurrently released Upgraded, starring Camila Mendes, Players, directed by Trish Sie (Pitch Perfect 3) from a script by Whit Anderson, is another case of a veteran small-screen star\u2019s magnetism outweighing a film\u2019s more discordant or patently ridiculous elements. In this case, the many schemes to score a one-night stand run by Mack and her crew \u2013 her fellow journalist and enthusiastic straight-man Adam (Damon Wayans Jr), the catty, carnal Brannagan (Augustus Prew) and Brannagan\u2019s somewhat hapless brother Little (Joel Courtney, of Netflix\u2019s The Kissing Booth movies). They\u2019re sports people \u2013 Mack especially is a diehard Yankees fan \u2013 for whom sex and romance is pure strategy and payoff, Xs and Os on the whiteboard. Players is at times too sitcom-y in its abstraction \u2013 everything is a play, sex the score, nothing for keeps. (At least it shows some sex on-screen, though it\u2019s of the vigorous, slapstick variety.) That is, until Mack beds Nick Marshall (Lucifer\u2019s Tom Ellis), an award-winning war journalist whose accolades, experience and money spark envy, a feeling sometimes indistinguishable from lust, or love. Suddenly it\u2019s the playoffs: convert a one-night stand into a romance because, as Mack puts it, \u201cI\u2019m 33 and I\u2019m exhausted and I want an adult.\u201d Or as Brannagan describes the task in one of the film\u2019s many funny-ish bits on modern dating, \u201cundoing simple dick brain\u201d. The lengths that the generally winsome crew go to lock it down, up to and including stalking and binders full of personal data, are outlandish (and occasionally humorous), but the stakes feel real. Though Mack is a caricature of a guys\u2019 girl, the type to drink tall boy Sapporos, eat greasy Chinese takeout out of the carton and watch wrestling, who hits the bar every night looking hot and toned but never works out, Rodriguez keeps her yearning \u2013 for love, for professional success, for change and direction \u2013 at the surface. Anderson\u2019s script is savvy enough to render Nick as neither villain nor flawless catch \u2013 he\u2019s an adult person, and as such more complicated than his stats. But who hasn\u2019t mistook the idea of someone for love? Players is self-aware enough, too, to poke fun at its own holes, such as how Mack has no female friends, which introduces the receptionist Ashley (YouTuber Liza Koshy) and Adam\u2019s new girlfriend Claire (SNL\u2019s Ego Nwodim) into the crew. (To be fair, as Mack says, it\u2019s difficult to make friends as an adult.) Sie\u2019s direction, though at times reaching for too much flair, is solid and unusually grounded for this micro-genre; the Brooklyn of this film, bowling alleys and pool bars and the promenade near the bridge, maps on to the actual borough. In the storied history of romcoms disconnected from any real understanding of journalism, Players has more substance than most \u2013 there\u2019s a real grit to Mack\u2019s career as a local sports journalist, though it\u2019s hard to believe there\u2019s a full Brooklyn in-office newspaper with a local sports section in the year 2024. (Much about the movie, from the journalism to the fashion to the attempts to couple the Netflix aesthetic with on-location gravitas, feels more suited for the mid-2010s.) Still, some things are evergreen. Rodriguez\u2019s Mack is easy to root for; her confused attempts to settle in her early 30s, however far-fetched in practice, emotionally lived in. Wayans, who honed his comedic timing on the spiritually related sitcom New Girl, is well-suited as the long-overlooked best friend turned possible romantic interest. Ellis, as Nick, is suitably handsome, debonair and not all that he\u2019s cracked up to be. Such is the game of dating. Players may trip on its gimmicks at times, but there\u2019s enough lived experience beneath the rapid-fire quips to work. For a streaming economy romcom, particularly of the Netflix variety, it\u2019s batting far above average. Players is out now on Netflix",

        "body": "How did you get into comedy? I joined a sketch group, went to the Edinburgh fringe, and then kept doing that for years. It\u2019s a good place to try and get better, to work out what you\u2019re doing. Who were your early influences? When I first moved to London I watched Paul Foot a lot. You need to see Paul Foot. He\u2019s unique. I would think: \u201cWhat on earth could I do that would be half as funny as that?\u201d Can you recall a gig so bad, it\u2019s now funny? It doesn\u2019t become that funny with time. I did do one in a pub, in London. Pindrop silence. After about two minutes the compere walked slowly towards me through the aisle. Then he stood right in front of me, staring at me, so I finished up. But I\u2019m not laughing that much recalling it. What\u2019s one of the strangest encounters with a fan you\u2019ve had? My train to Edinburgh had to terminate in Newcastle because of some gales. I needed to get to Edinburgh to do a gig. I was negotiating with a taxi driver, then another man who also needed to get to Scotland asked if he could join. Then he suddenly looked stressed and took his earphones out. He was listening to me on a podcast. So, I mean quite strange for me. I\u2019d say very strange for him. A cab driver asks what you do. You say: \u201cComedian.\u201d They ask you to tell them a joke. What do you say? Yeah, you see, that\u2019s a rookie error. You do not volunteer that information. Protect yourself. Say you work in education. When they say \u201cteacher?\u201d say \u201cno, I\u2019m involved in updating the curriculum\u201d. Anything, just shut it down. Avoid comedy, absolute minefield. They\u2019ll be asking if you\u2019ve met Rob Beckett next. Preshow rituals? I used to be worse. I used to walk the same route, go in the same shop, buy the same thing, arrive at the same time \u2026 all that. It felt very important. Nowadays, I still like to walk to the gig where possible. And I like to have a pint before I go on. Best heckle? Heckles are rare thank God. They\u2019re not that useful. I\u2019ve had decent \u201ccontributions\u201d. The other day someone announced he was looking into buying a gong. You\u2019re about to publish your fifth volume of poetry, Chapters. What should readers expect? Well, it\u2019s beautifully designed, by my friend Emily Juniper. It\u2019s full of poems from the last 18 months. And there\u2019s also a bit of dialogue between me and Emily as we discuss what should go in the book etc. Meta. Where do you find you material? Anywhere. There\u2019s always something happening, and if not there\u2019s the old imagination to fall back on. It\u2019s good to write in interesting places: airports, hospitals, things like that. I like writing in the pub, but then the poems tend to be about the pub. There\u2019s quite a lot of those in the book. What are you currently excited for? My friend Tom Basden and I shot a film over the summer. No knowing if it\u2019s any good but Carey Mulligan\u2019s in it so there\u2019s a limit to how bad it can be. It\u2019s been 17 years in the making, so we\u2019re happy it\u2019s on the verge. Do you have a comedy hero? There\u2019s a lot. Been watching a lot of Richard Briers recently. He\u2019s fantastic. Such a good actor, so much heart, funny in such a beautiful way. And a hero not in comedy? Difficult to look beyond Jude Bellingham. \u2022 Chapters by Tim Key is out now from \u201cUtter\u201d &amp; Press and is available on audiobook via Bandcamp.",

        "body": "Now that there\u2019s a competition show for practically every profession or hobby you can imagine, you might think that viewers\u2019 appetites for them would be on the wane. I certainly thought I was over this kind of thing, yet, somehow, every Sunday evening, I find that I am suddenly enormously invested in people making novelty teapots out of clay. Clearly there is still plenty of life in the format yet. Enter Bring the Drama, a noble, sometimes earnest, often lovely quest to give wannabe actors of all ages a shot at fulfilling their dreams. It is hosted by Bill Bailey, who chivvies things along nicely, though the real star is the fair but stern casting director Kelly Valentine Hendry, who is there to put the eight ambitious amateurs through their professional paces. \u201cThis industry is skewed towards privilege,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe that has to change.\u201d There\u2019s actually little mention of class, at least directly, but it is evident that, for one reason or another, the eight finalists did not feel able to pursue acting as a professional career. Some say this was financial, others cultural, while some simply did not know where to begin. Here, they are offered the same sorts of opportunities they might have had access to if they went to drama school. They get an acting coach, auditions, and at the end of the series \u2013 for the three standout contestants \u2013 a showcase performance, attended by agents and other professionals. The show\u2019s success relies on the audience rooting for the amateurs, and, fittingly, they have been very well cast. This might be the post-Traitors effect, but it continues to be refreshing to see more of a broad age range taking part. The actors here range from 22 to 67, and as a result, their stories are nicely varied. Ex-police officer George, 62, says that he always wanted to be an actor. When he retired, he set up a local drama group, but explains that he is from a \u201ctough\u201d family and that showing his emotions does not come naturally to him. When he gets on to a set and the cameras are on, however, there is no stopping him. Lizzie, 26, is now a civil servant, but dropped out of university to give acting a go and worked as a cleaner, in retail and in a call centre to support herself. She says that her mother wanted her to be a doctor, but hopes that one day, at least, she might be able to play one. Each week, the actors get to audition, and those who are successful go on to recreate a scene from one of the UK\u2019s biggest dramas. They\u2019re not auditioning to be in the shows, exactly, but to go on set and film a famous moment, as directed by one of the stars of the show. So in the first episode, they all trot off to Elstree, to replay the scene from EastEnders in which Sonia saves Ben Mitchell from his collapsed lung, while Phil and Linda look on and panic. Natalie Cassidy, who plays Sonia, directs them with kindness and compassion. Soap acting requires heightened emotions, we are told, but as the aspiring actors are new to the game, their interpretation of \u201cheightened\u201d veers from kitchen-sink realism to \u201cYou ain\u2019t my muvva!\u201d extremes. Hendry doesn\u2019t pull any punches. \u201cI thought that audition was \u2026 adequate,\u201d she says. To be fair, she has forewarned them that rejection is par for the course. It\u2019s clear that a bit of tough love is nothing compared with what they would face in the real world. One issue with a programme that is mostly about the acting craft is that your interest in the process of learning to emote may depend on how invested you are in the skills required to be a professional actor. Similarly, most people will tell you that film and TV sets are pretty tedious places to be, once the novelty has worn off. They mostly involve a lot of standing around in a padded jacket, waiting for the catering van to serve up a jacket potato. This sort of thing has worked before. The now Oscar-nominated Jessie Buckley got her break on I\u2019d Do Anything, the Andrew Lloyd Webber-led hunt for a cast of an Oliver! stage production. Bring The Drama is gentle \u2013 it\u2019s very pleasant to watch, rather than a Queen Vic-worthy melodrama \u2013 but it is important. Acting is far too skewed towards privilege. If that is such a problem in the real world that it takes a new TV competition series to address it, then we should take it as a warning sign. If only wealthy and privately educated actors get access to such opportunities, then something significant will be lost before we even know that it has gone. Bring the Drama aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer.",

        "body": "Directors of Shakespeare\u2019s comedy of aristocrats, artisans and sprites getting confused in a wood often seem influenced by one title word. Midsummer stagings are light and magical, Night shows rather darker. Eleanor Rhode\u2019s RSC revival is driven by Dream, crucially incorporating the sub-categories of nightmare and erotic fantasy, including the rather niche reverie of sex with a donkey. Characters mash, worlds invert, flames burst from fingers, people move backwards (inflecting Tenet and Christopher Nolan\u2019s dreamscape movie Inception), and surreal moments include one that resembles an explosion in a children\u2019s indoor play pit. Bally Gill\u2019s charismatic doubling of Athenian Duke Theseus and faery king Oberon \u2013 matched by Sirine Saba\u2019s sparky pairing of Hippolyta and faery queen Titania \u2013 strongly suggest that what we are seeing in the wood scenes is the nocturnal consequence of a big Greek pre-wedding dinner. In this reading, the elf Puck \u2013 athletically and musically played by Premi Tamang, replacing Rosie Sheehy, indisposed on press night \u2013 becomes a Freudian blurring of daughters, lovers and childhood fairytales. The non-dream scenes are also strikingly earthy. In the workers\u2019 play-within-the-play, Shakespeare, in casting someone as a Wall, enjoys joking about what the \u201chole\u201d in such a barrier might be, but this production doubles down on the entendre. Emily Cundick\u2019s Snout / Wall and Mathew Baynton\u2019s Bottom / Pyramus will have required the ingenuity of the credited intimacy directors. Baynton, due to his roles in the great TV comedies Ghosts and Horrible Histories, will draw younger and school audiences. They are very lucky to see a performer able to make Shakespeare\u2019s artisan comedy \u2013 frequently laborious now \u2013 genuinely funny. Via parodic voices (including past RSC acting styles), silly walks and too-loud outfits, he reaches an uproariously gory Pyramus death scene, stretching every part of his body including his tongue. Beneath the comedy, there is also the cruelty of a plot in which couples are tricked together or apart by a \u201clove juice\u201d. Under its influence, Ryan Hutton\u2019s laddish Lysander kisses his erstwhile partner, Dawn Sievewright\u2019s sarky Hermia, and recoils and retches as if he has just French-kissed a skunk. Due to the GCSE syllabus and its crowd-pleasing title, A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is one of the most performed Shakespeare plays. But this version consistently feels fresh, helped by Helen Monks\u2019s Rita (in the original Peter) Quince, a more deluded amateur theatrical than Lynda Snell in The Archers, and Boadicea Ricketts\u2019 bold proud Helena. A production\u2019s panache is easily attributed to a director but this feels clearly a team effort, with Lucy Osborne\u2019s design, John Bulleid\u2019s illusions, Matt Daw\u2019s lighting and Pete Malkin\u2019s sound also excelling in the dazzling inception. It feels fair to see it again, when the unfortunate Ms Sheehy is restored, but to do so will be a late winter dream. At Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 30 March",

        "body": "The publisher Bloomsbury has lifted its annual profit forecasts after the latest novel from the fantasy author Sarah J Maas topped bestseller lists across the world, aided by fans recommending her books on TikTok. The British publishing company told investors that its profits for the year would be ahead of December expectations, attributing much of this to the release of Maas\u2019s latest book, House of Flame and Shadow. The novel, which was released on 30 January, is the third book in Maas\u2019s series that follows Bryce Quinlan, a half human, half fairy-like creature, in the fantasy Crescent City. Maas\u2019s \u201cromantasy\u201d books have gained huge popularity and House of Flame and Shadow became the number one bestseller in the US, UK, Australia and a number of other countries. In the UK, it became the third-fastest-selling fantasy novel since records began, with 44,761 copies sold in its first week. The company said the new release had also driven demand for the previous 15 books written by Maas for Bloomsbury. The publisher, which is best known for publishing the Harry Potter series, said it expected to post pre-tax profits well ahead of the consensus market expectations, which put profits at \u00a337.2m for the year up to 29 February, on a turnover of \u00a3291.4m. The analyst Investec updated its forecasts for the company on Wednesday, predicting annual profits of \u00a348.1m and a turnover of \u00a3329.3m. The shares rose nearly 10% to 539p, the highest point since the company listed in 1994. The publisher currently has a deal for six more titles from Maas. Her popularity has been driven by an increased presence on social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, with fans sharing their love for the books with followers. Other authors in the \u201cromantasy\u201d genre, which mixes fantasy and romance, continue to experience high level of sales. The Fourth Wing series by Rebecca Yarros is popular. Her book Iron Flame recently became the bestselling fantasy book since records began, selling 57,055 in its first week last November. Nigel Newton, the chief executive of Bloomsbury, said the \u201cexceptionally strong trading period\u201d was driven by increasing demand for fantasy fiction. \u201cSarah J Maas is a publishing phenomenon and we are very fortunate to have signed her up with her first book 13 years ago. \u201cHer books have a huge audience which continues to grow, backed by major Bloomsbury promotional campaigns, driving strong word-of-mouth recommendation, particularly through TikTok and Instagram channels,\u201d said Newton. Bloomsbury also pointed to other recent publications that had helped drive sales, which included the Harry Potter Wizarding Almanac, Tom Kerridge\u2019s cookery book Pub Kitchen, and Ghosts, the book to accompany the popular BBC comedy series.",

But when he was invited to play at Cosmic Slop, a 200-capacity party tucked away in a former brass and iron works in Leeds, he knew he had to go. \u201cWord was circulating: \u2018you\u2019ve gotta go and check out the system\u2019,\u201d he recalls, referencing the now-legendary hand-built speaker rig, revered by underground heroes such as Theo Parrish and Bradley Zero.

During the week, the venue runs workshops and classes in the adjacent rooms. \u201cThat\u2019s the strange thing about Slop, it\u2019s one of the best clubs in the world but it\u2019s actually just a party to support a charity that\u2019s doing really important work,\u201d says Floating Points, real name Sam Shepherd. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\u201d But in 2017, Cosmic Slop faced the threat of closure as the Grade II-listed building was put up for sale, to be turned into flats. \u201cWe could\u2019ve just lost it all,\u201d says co-founder Tom Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s got consistently harder for spaces like this to exist, and the kind of the support we offer for young people has got harder and harder to provide.\u201d There\u2019s a real devotion from both sides of the booth: high-profile DJs, including Four Tet, Mr Scruff and Caribou, play for free in order to maximise the funds raised, while each party prompts queues along the otherwise nondescript street before the guest is even announced. By 11.30pm, the door staff have to operate a one-in one-out policy. But despite the exclusivity and the audiophile set-up, it\u2019s far from a stiff, chin-stroking atmosphere. With curtains and lampshades framing the room, fresh fruit available at the DIY bar and a team of infectiously friendly staff, it could almost be mistaken for someone\u2019s living room. \u201cIt\u2019s like the antithesis of everything commercial in club culture,\u201d says Gilles Peterson, who first played at Cosmic Slop in 2017. \u201cYou walk into certain places and you can just see the love, care and attention that the promoters and organisers put into it. It rubs off on to the people and so you transfer immediately into that vibe as the DJ. That is the perfect scenario for me.\u201d The open music policy means that punters can hear anything from rare jazz and disco to modern trap music, threaded together by mood rather than genre or BPM. \u201cOn a big system like that, and with an open minded crowd that have come knowing what it\u2019s all about, I can play all the stuff I really wanna play,\u201d says Shepherd. \u201cI like playing music that was designed for dancefloors but I also really like playing music that was definitely not designed for dancefloors.\u201d When I ask him to elaborate, he reels off a list that includes strange folk and percussion, Brazilian soap opera opening sequences and a particularly rhythmic recording of frogs. \u201cIt sounds like techno, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d he laughs. In the style of Detroit legends 3 Chairs and parties like The Loft, it\u2019s not rare to hear a track from start to finish, crackles and all, before moving on to the next. The long-championed approach feels increasingly rare in contemporary clubbing, which often favours big drops and quick blends. \u201cWhat if the tune has a beautiful intro? You could skip to the beat and mix it from there but you might miss the best bit,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s a different way of digesting the music.\u201d Having weathered the threat of redevelopment, Smith is optimistic. After a two-year fundraising campaign, MAP bought Hope House in 2019, ensuring a future for both the classrooms and the club. This month, the team are launching a new label offshoot, with an all-in house production line, from the recording to the dubplate cutting and sleeve printing. The inaugural releases will be by long-term friend and supporter Four Tet, including a cassette edition of his digital-only record 871 and, later this year, a limited edition run of his new album, complete with custom artwork by MAP students. \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity to share what we\u2019ve got with a lot of people,\u201d says Smith. It\u2019s a reminder of what grassroots clubbing can provide when the resources are there. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to keep these things going because they live off energy, and energy when there isn\u2019t that much income is always hard to maintain after a few years,\u201d says Peterson. \u201cSo it\u2019s really important that places like that keep getting the new energy \u2026 to keep the walls shiny and the lights bright.\u201d",

        "body": "David Harewood has called for acting graduates to be taught \u201cresilience\u201d to steel them for the industry\u2019s brutal side, as he prepares to take over as president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. The actor, who is to replace Kenneth Branagh in the role, has pledged to pass on what he learned after suffering with mental health issues as a young Rada graduate. He said: \u201cI had some problems when I left and I think it is incumbent upon myself and Rada to teach resilience and prepare students: give them financial skills \u2013 tax skills, for example \u2013 things that we were never prepared for.\u201d In the 2019 BBC documentary David Harewood: Psychosis and Me, the actor discussed his mental health struggles, which resulted in him being sectioned shortly after graduating. He was subjected to racist reviews and left with limited opportunities upon being pigeonholed as a \u201cblack actor\u201d. Harewood says it instilled in him a desire to pass on his knowledge as a very active and accessible president. \u201cRather than being a sort of standard bearer for the school in terms of a fundraiser, I really want to be there and as accessible to the students as possible,\u201d he said. The actor plans to use his connections in the industry to bring in stars who have found success, as well as actors who have found it hard, to share their experiences. \u201cI intend to bring some of my successful friends into the drama school, those who have had successful careers and those who have struggled,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to hear both sides of the coin.\u201d Cynthia Erivo will join Harewood, who is the first black president of Rada, as the inaugural vice-president at the school. Harewood, who has long advocated for more opportunities for black British actors in the UK industry after having to move to the US to get his big break, said his and Erivo\u2019s presence would send a strong message to students. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sticking plaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is part of a concerted agenda to take diversity and inclusion to a new level and change the direction \u2013 we\u2019ve had 120 years of Rada being one thing and it\u2019s been very successful, but the future will be a very different playground. We have to embrace that and be a beacon for inclusivity and diversity.\u201d Rada admitted it was \u201cinstitutionally racist\u201d in 2021 after students complained about non-inclusive teaching, and the organisation apologised for its \u201cinadequate response\u201d to the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. Harewood said the school, which enacted an action plan after a review of its processes, was on the brink \u201cof a new era\u201d and had genuinely changed. \u201cHaving been through the training at a time when questions of race were handled in a non-inclusive way, being part of an agenda where that discussion is open and honest is a good thing,\u201d said Harewood. \u201cWe have to get on board with these things. It\u2019s exciting to be part of this new wave and this new generation who want to build a new vision of how things should be. 40% of Rada\u2019s intake on the BA acting course is either black or non-white, and I think it\u2019s important that we represent those young people.\u201d Branagh, who had a nine-year tenure at Rada, said: \u201cIt is a thrill to welcome the brilliant David Harewood and Cynthia Erivo to their new roles at the academy.\u201d",

        "body": "Gillian fell in love with Africa after taking a sabbatical trip to Ethiopia in 2014, where she ran an agricultural NGO. After returning home to Toronto the following year, she realised she wanted to go back. \u201cI am really passionate about environmental issues and was drawn to Africa,\u201d she says. \u201cI work for a sustainability advice company and decided to transfer to their Kenya office.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2019 that she met Frances, who had moved from the Philippines to work for the same firm. \u201cI wanted an adventure and I was interested in developing markets,\u201d says Frances. \u201cWhen I arrived, I found out that Gillian was going to be my boss on a conservation project in east Africa.\u201d They met properly for the first time at a coffee shop, to catch up on the project and get to know each other. \u201cMy first impression was that she was very serious and a bit boring,\u201d admits Frances. Gillian thought Frances seemed smart but she didn\u2019t expect her to be around for long. \u201cMost people come for about a year. I figured I\u2019d work with her for a while and then never see her again.\u201d Their work involved lots of travel, which meant long drives and nights spent in different towns across the continent. \u201cOne day, we got stuck somewhere and I remember thinking: \u2018I don\u2019t want to have dinner with my boss!\u2019\u201d says Frances. \u201cBut we ended up talking about lots of interesting things. I told her a bit about my experiences of being from Chinese heritage \u2013 in Africa, people weren\u2019t used to seeing people who looked like me.\u201d On their drives, Gillian began telling Frances about the environmental impact of their work. \u201cShe was really passionate about the topic and would send me about five website links every day,\u201d she says. \u201cBut she did get me to question how I made decisions and I started making an effort to eat more vegetarian food.\u201d They also found that they have a goofy side. \u201cWe are both artistic, high-energy and a bit competitive,\u201d says Gillian. \u201cWe write parody songs and make animated videos about our lives. We also do tough maths and logic challenges and even did a 100-day drawing challenge together. I\u2019m always a bit salty when Frances bests me at anything, but also impressed.\u201d When lockdown hit in 2020, they couldn\u2019t meet up, but it wasn\u2019t long before Frances turned to her new friend for help. \u201cI had never lived alone before,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore Covid, I\u2019d had home help, so it was a huge learning curve for me.\u201d She would phone Gillian to ask her how to work the washing machine or switch on the oven. \u201cI discovered she\u2019d been living on takeaways and overnight oats before lockdown,\u201d Gillian says. \u201cIt quickly became a joke \u2013 my dad used to call Frances my daughter. She asked me for recipes and made all kinds of cooking gaffes, like nearly putting a metal fork in the microwave. But what impressed me was her humility and ability to learn quickly. In a few months, she was making multi-course meals and eventually she invited friends over for a dinner party.\u201d As well as their sense of humour, the pair also share a passion for art and drawing. \u201cShe\u2019s so talented,\u201d says Frances. \u201cWe also discovered that we\u2019re both Christian, so it\u2019s nice to have a friend with the same values who can give advice based on a shared ethos.\u201d Over the past few years, they have supported each other through relationship breakups and family issues, as well as the day-to-day stresses of work. Though Frances moved back to the Philippines in 2021, they still communicate via email and WhatsApp every day. \u201cFrances is a unique person,\u201d says Gillian. \u201cShe never says no to anything. I call her the sunshine of my life because she\u2019s just so bright. I had always found it hard to find real friends until I met her.\u201d Frances feels that Gillian has been a fantastic role model for her. \u201cShe\u2019s so smart and talented and has a lot of wisdom,\u201d she says. \u201cGillian always listens to people and is interested in getting to know them. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything she can\u2019t do.\u201d",

        "body": "Nato defence ministers met in Brussels. The meeting came at a time when European officials are keeping a close eye on developments in the US, where Donald Trump said he would not defend Nato members that don\u2019t meet defence spending target. During the session, ministers highlighted their countries\u2019 contributions to the alliance. The French defence minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, said his country\u2019s defence spending will reach 2% of Gross Domestic Product this year. Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, underscored \u201c75 years of the transatlantic security partnership on the basis of mutual trust.\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said it is in the US interest to have a strong Nato. The alliance chief also said Nato is \u201con the right track\u201d when it comes to defence investment. France and Ukraine are expected to sign a bilateral agreement on security commitments tomorrow. Air alert warnings sounded across Ukraine overnight as Russia launched a massive missile attack on the country. A missile strike on the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border killed six people, a Russian official said. Ukraine is conducting a manoeuvre in Avdiivka to withdraw troops in some areas to \u201cmore advantageous positions\u201d, a military spokesman said. Asked about criticism from some American politicians, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary-general, said: We are 31 democratic nations on both sides of the Atlantic. And as long as this alliance has existed, there have been different views and discussions. He added: When you look at the opinion polls, there is record high support for Nato. \u201cI\u2019m confident,\u201d Stoltenberg said, \u201cthat Nato will remain the strongest and most succesful alliance in history.\u201d He also said: I expect the United States to continue to be a staunch ally, for at least three reasons: First, it is in the national security interest of the United States to have a strong Nato. Second, there is actually broad bipartisan support for Nato in the United States. And thirdly, the criticism in the United States is not primarily against Nato, it\u2019s against Nato allies not spending enough money on Nato. And then actually we have a very good story to tell. Because for many years, it was a valid point and a fair case to raise from the US side that European allies and Canada did not spend enough. But things have really changed, with increased defence spending across Canada and Europe. Stoltenberg underscored that \u201cit is in the US interest to have a strong Nato because no other major power has anything like Nato \u2013 more than 30 friends and allies, and that makes the US stronger.\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said ministers discussed the \u201cdeteriorating security environment.\u201d \u201cWe can never take peace for granted,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we do not see an imminent military threat against the alliance.\u201d He added: Nato continues to ensure there\u2019s no room for miscalculation in Moscow about our readiness to protect all allies. Speaking to reporters after the Nato defence ministers\u2019 meeting, Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance\u2019s secretary-general, said \u201ctoday we accelerated work on resourcing our new defence plans and strengthening our transatlantic defence industrial base.\u201d \u201cThis requires investment, and we are on the right track,\u201d he stressed. In 2024, European Nato allies will invest a total of 380 billion dollars in defence, he said, noting that for the first time, this amounts to 2% of their total GDP. Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister, said he had a conversation with his Polish counterpart, Donald Tusk. The main topic is the situation at the border. We also talked about the increase in imports, especially grain, from the Russian federation and third countries to the EU. Ukraine and Poland should join forces to prevent Russian products from entering the European market. A missile strike on the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukraine border on Thursday killed six people, including a child, and injured 18 others, a Russian official said. It was the latest in exchanges of long-range missile and rocket fire in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Hours earlier, Russia fired two dozen cruise and ballistic missiles at a broad area of Ukraine, hitting multiple regions after a midnight strike in Ukraine\u2019s northeast killed five people in an apartment building, authorities said. Five of the 18 people injured in Belgorod, a city of about 340,000 people, were children, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram. Tass news agency reported that 15 people were hospitalized. In its latest defence intelligence update, the British defence ministry said that \u201con 14 February 2024, Ukrainian forces conducted a successful uncrewed surface vessel attack on the Russian Rophucha-class landing craft Tsezar Kunikov, which almost certainly resulted in the sinking of the vessel.\u201d It added that \u201cthree of ten Ropucha-class vessels have now been destroyed by Ukrainian strikes.\u201d Canada\u2019s defence minister, Bill Blair, has announced that his country has finalised procuring an air defence capability and is acquiring new counter-drone equipment for Canadian troops in Latvia. Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, has welcomed the new members of the European Sky Shield Initiative, which now has 21 members. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, which begins tomorrow Here\u2019s a \u201cfamily photo\u201d from today\u2019s Nato defence minister\u2019s meeting. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, said in a post on Telegram that 5 people were killed and 18 injured in a Ukrainian missile attack. Ukraine is conducting a manoeuvre in Avdiivka to withdraw troops in some areas to \u201cmore advantageous positions\u201d, military spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy said today, Reuters reported. He said that Ukraine had activated a backup logistics route into the town, but that supplies into Avdiivka and evacuations from it were \u201cdifficult\u201d. France and Ukraine will sign a bilateral agreement on security commitments tomorrow, the Elysee has announced, Reuters reported. The agreement was expected to be finalised in Ukraine, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had postponed his trip. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is set to visit France and Germany. After Donald Trump said he would not defend Nato members that don\u2019t meet defence spending targets, European governments are keen to showcase their contributions to the alliance\u2019s defences. This dynamic was on full display this morning. The German delegation to Nato posted on social media reiterating that Germany \u201cprovides significant forces postures\u201d to the alliance. The French defence minister, S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, said his country\u2019s defence spending will reach 2% of Gross Domestic Product this year. The World Bank, the European Commission, and the United Nations have increased their estimates for the total cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine to $486 billion (\u20ac452.8 billion) over the next decade, up from $411 billion (\u20ac383 billion) estimated one year ago. In a joint statement they said: In 2024 alone, Ukrainian authorities estimate the country will need around $15 billion (\u20ac14 billion) for immediate reconstruction and recovery priorities at both the national and community level, with a particular focus on supporting and mobilising the private sector alongside restoration of housing, soft infrastructure and services, energy, and transport. The figures highlight the urgency of the EU\u2019s commitment to deliver \u20ac50bn in a new Ukraine facility to find schools, housing, pensions and health services at an emergency leaders meeting last month. Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine\u2019s prime minister, said: We see that the needs for reconstruction have continued to grow over the past year. The main resource for Ukraine\u2019s recovery should be the confiscation of Russian assets frozen in the West. We need to start this process already this year. Concurrently, the Ukrainian government is creating conditions to attract private investments, which will accelerate the reconstruction process and transform our country on its path to the EU. Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, underscored when arriving at the Nato defence ministers\u2019 meeting this morning the \u201c75 years of the transatlantic security partnership on the basis of mutual trust.\u201d Germany, he said, along with along with 17 other Nato allies, \u201cwill reach the agreed 2% target this year.\u201d He added: Our aim must be to be the backbone of conventional deterrence and defence in Europe with other partners. Grant Shapps, the British defence secretary, said that the UK will co-lead a major drone capability coalition with Latvia for Ukraine. I\u2019m proud to announce that the UK and Latvia will co-lead an international coalition to build Ukraine\u2019s vital drone capabilities. Together, we will give Ukraine the capabilities it needs to defend itself and win this war, to ensure that Putin fails in his illegal and barbaric ambitions. The head of the House intelligence committee, Mike Turner, has called for the Biden administration to declassify information on what he called a \u201cserious national security threat\u201d, which was later reported to involve Russian plans to deploy nuclear weapons in space. In his statement, Turner, an Ohio Republican, gave no details about the supposed security threat. Talking to reporters at the White House later on Wednesday, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, expressed surprise at Turner\u2019s statement saying he was due to meet the \u201cgang of eight\u201d (congressional leaders with special security clearance for classified briefings) on Thursday. But Sullivan did not give any details of the planned meeting. ABC News and the New York Times cited unnamed sources as saying that the security threat Turner was referring to involved Russia\u2019s potential deployment of a nuclear anti-satellite weapon in space. The New York Times said US allies had also been briefed on the intelligence, which was not deemed to represent an urgent threat, as the alleged Russian capability was still in development. Read the full story here. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has thanked Australia for contributing funds to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s defence capabilities. Arriving at today\u2019s meeting of defence ministers, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told reporters that \u201csupporting Ukraine is not charity\u201d and that helping Kyiv \u201cis an investment in our own security.\u201d He said ministers will discuss their support to Ukraine and strengthening the alliance\u2019s deterrence and defence. He added: And to do both, we need to invest more, and we are on the right track. Because we now have historic numbers when it comes to defence investments. Last year, we saw an 11% real increase in defence spending across Europe and Canada. This year, we expect 18 Allies to meet the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. And European Allies together spend 280 billion US dollars on defence. And this is 2% of their combined GDP. But we still have a way to go. Because at our summit in Vilnius last year, all allies promised to spend 2% of GDP on defence, and 2% is a minimum. Addressing today\u2019s session with Ukraine\u2019s representatives, Stoltenberg said: We will address how to sustain our support to Ukraine. We see that our support is making a difference on the battlefield every day. Just yesterday, the Ukrainians were able to strike successfully a Russian naval ship, and this demonstrates the skills and the competence of Ukrainian armed forces, also in conducting deep strikes behind the Russian lines. He also stressed that Nato allies need to boost production of ammunition. To ensure that Ukraine gets the weapons, the supplies, the ammunitions they need, we need to ramp up production. And NATO allies have, just over the last months - since we agreed the defence investment plan - agreed and signed contracts for 10 billion euros, for more orders from different parts of the transatlantic defence industry. Air alert warnings sounded across Ukraine overnight as Russia launched a massive missile attack on the country. Ukrainian authorities reported the take-off of several Tu-95 strategic bombers in the early hours of Thursday morning, with explosions heard soon after. In Dnipro, a series loud explosions were audible shortly after 6am in the centre of the city. There were also reports of explosions in Zaporizhzhia, the capital Kyiv and the western city of Lviv. Andriy Sadoviy, the mayor of Lviv, said ten Russian missiles had been aimed at the Lviv region. In Zaporizhzhia, close to the front line with Russian forces, there were reports of a damaged apartment building. There was no information immediately available about casualties. Good morning and welcome back to the Europe blog. Today we will be delving into the Nato defence ministers\u2019 meeting in Brussels, which will include a session of the Nato-Ukraine Council. We will also keep you updated on all the latest in Ukraine.",

        "body": "For years, women have been asking for fairness in all sporting events, including parkrun. There is nothing \u201crightwing\u201d about that (Why have rightwingers made even parkrun a battleground for trans people?, 14 February). Any event that reports results separated into male and female categories, as parkrun does, is acknowledging that sex matters in sport. Many parkrunners value their achievements, which include overall placing by sex and age category, and age-graded score. But parkrun\u2019s policy is that male runners may register as female based on their \u201cidentity\u201d. As a result, some female course and age-grade records are held by male runners. The hyperbolic talk of requiring genital checks to change this is disingenuous. Parkrun does not carry out age or sex checks on anyone. All we want is that when parkrun asks people to register by sex and age, it indicates that \u201csex\u201d means sex at birth, as World Athletics and UK Athletics recommend. Runners who don\u2019t want to state their sex have two other options: \u201canother gender identity\u201d or \u201cprefer not to say\u201d. But rather than amending its registration policy, parkrun has hidden the problem by deleting the records of many men and women. Each week, there will still be males recorded as \u201cfirst female\u201d, bumping female runners down in their own category. It\u2019s less than two months since parkrun celebrated a new women\u2019s parkrun world record. It mattered then. Now parkrun is telling women who value their running achievements that the feelings of trans-identifying males matter more than theirs. Parkrun is fully inclusive \u2013 anyone can turn up and walk or run, for free. There is no need for it to be a vehicle for identities as well \u2013 and using it for this purpose is unfair to women, who care as much as men about success, recognition and excellence. Fiona McAnena Director of sport, Fair Play For Women \u2022 Jonathan Liew claims female parkrunners who want to compare run times with peers of the same age and sex are \u201cthe radical trans exclusionary police\u201d, \u201cuseful idiots on social media\u201d and part of \u201cthe rage machine\u201d, and that the issue \u201cisn\u2019t really about sport at all\u201d. This is all astonishing hyperbole. I am a leftwing feminist academic whose expertise is in women and sport, a Labour member, a director of the politically left Woman\u2019s Place UK, and a founder signatory of the Labour Women\u2019s Declaration. This denigration of female runners who campaign for their own grassroots sport categories as anti-trans and rightwing is offensive and reminiscent of historical battles for female-only sport over 100 years. Parkrun offers four categories: female, male, \u201cprefer not to say\u201d and \u201canother gender identity\u201d. Trans people should, of course, be included \u2013 trans men in female categories, if they so wish. But trans women, most of whom retain a 10% male performance advantage, can surely register in one of the other three categories. Because the hopes and dreams of female people matter. Many female runners want to know their run time compared with other females in their age group. Just like male runners. Course records in the one female category should celebrate the fastest female runners. How is that a rightwing outrage? The left leaves a wide-open goal for the right if it denies female runners even one female-only category. Cathy Devine Manchester \u2022 Thank you, Jonathan Liew, for your thoughtful piece. As a regular parkrunner, a cis woman and someone with a close family member who is a trans woman, I have a fair amount of skin in this game. I welcome running alongside trans women just as much as anyone else in my community. That is what community is \u2013 welcoming humanity in all its beautiful difference \u2013 and why parkrun is anathema to those who wish to police the boundaries of acceptability according to their narrow and reactionary definitions. I disagree with Policy Exchange rightwingers (and those helping to spread their prejudice), but they are welcome to run alongside me at parkrun. They might just get out of their echo chamber long enough to meet the human beings they are so keen to write off as nothing more than an ideology to be disparaged. I can\u2019t promise they won\u2019t get a worse finish time though. Hate slows you down. Name and address supplied \u2022 To talk about a desire to \u201cerase trans women from physical sport\u201d is hyperbolic; no one, as far as I\u2019ve been able to tell, wants anyone erased from sport. All that certain women \u2013 including me \u2013 would like is for everyone to participate in the right sports category for their sex. Jacqui Lewis London",

        "body": "Sidney Poitier once said he was tasked with \u201ca terrific burden\u201d. As the most high-profile Black actor of his era he felt he carried \u201cthe hopes and dreams of an entire people\u201d, but in 2024, when the TV landscape has nurtured the talents of Will Smith, Issa Rae, Tracee Ellis Ross and Quinta Brunson, Black talent\u2019s burden seems less terrific. Clearly musician/comedian/actor Vince Staples doesn\u2019t feel the pressure to be the respectable role model that Poitier felt he needed to be, judging by his self-titled sitcom \u2013 in which he really lets his freak flag fly. Staples\u2019s latest project embraces the weird, with this self-titled, surreal comedy \u2013 in which his protagonist navigates the dream-logic of a disquieting reality. He plays a fictionalised version of himself, a successful performer with a natural swagger whose world is filled with twisted, David Lynch-like humour. This Vince lives in a stylish mid-century modern home in a bizarre version of Long Beach, California, which is referred to only as \u201cthe Beach\u201d, and the episodes begin with a Fargo-esque disclaimer: \u201cThis is a work of fiction. Any similarities to actual events are purely coincidental.\u201d The first episode follows a brief stint in jail after a traffic violation where even the racist police officers can\u2019t help but think Staples is pretty darn cool. The rest follows our preternaturally chilled-out hero on an odyssey through small business loans, tense family cookouts, reunions with childhood rivals and, horror of horrors, trying to find a decent thing to eat at a theme park. While the set-ups are slight, the execution is delicious. Staples navigates bank heists and relationship quandaries with ludicrous suaveness. He casts himself as the perpetual straight man, nonplussed by the surreal goings-on around him, even resorting to deadpan wit mid-bank robbery (\u201cYou do a heist, you\u2019re George Clooney. You rob a bank, you\u2019re Queen Latifah\u201d). To add to the spirit of marching to the beat of his own drum, there are only five episodes, which range from 26 to just 18 minutes. Staples himself is an endlessly compelling presence, with a near-permanent furrowed brow, a baritone drawl and a lightness of touch in his delivery that means he never overexerts himself to land a punchline. The dialogue is sparse but pointed. We don\u2019t hear how exactly our eponymous figure knows the face-painted figure who is robbing the bank where he has just been refused a loan, but their easy rapport is so effortlessly established that we not only come to immediately understand the nature of their relationship, but also join Vince in wanting them to make off with the vault\u2019s contents in a speedy getaway. Staples has previously been best known as an affiliate of the California alt hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All, which counted Frank Ocean and Tyler, the Creator among its members. But he has also appeared in the recent White Men Can\u2019t Jump remake, coming-of-age indie dramedy Dope and has a recurring role on the popular sitcom Abbott Elementary as Janine\u2019s love interest, Maurice. Given his career background and his show\u2019s phantasmagorical flights of whimsy, the logical comparison for this series would be with Donald Glover\u2019s Atlanta, which was launched after Glover\u2019s successful stint on Dan Harmon\u2019s cult college-set comedy Community and early success under his rapper pseudonym Childish Gambino. Even if the two highly funny, delightfully weird shows are ultimately different beasts, both afford plenty of joy in watching Black men afforded the creative freedom to present the twisted workings of their minds without self-censoring for the sake of mass appeal \u2013 even if that comes across as a little weird to some. The series touches upon some serious issues as well as the more surreal comic touches. It delves into mass incarceration, gun violence and a difficult relationship between Vince and his mother (Coming to America\u2019s Vanessa Bell Calloway) \u2013 who are perpetually having to post bail for one another. But these issues only arise as they serve Vince\u2019s story, rather than his journey being used as a tool to preach about struggles facing the entire African American community. The series is executive produced by Kenya Barris, whose previous show, black-ish, focused on a successful, loving Black family and reportedly had 79% non-Black viewership. But the show is Staples\u2019s unique vision. Unlike black-ish\u2019s willingness to perform Blackness for the uninitiated (explaining to its audience the biases around hair, colourism or why \u201cwe\u201d love Prince), The Vince Staples Show isn\u2019t interested in making it more palatable or comprehensible to placate the Netflix masses. The creative partnership between the pair seems to have brought out the best in both, making this a return to form for Barris and a wonderful showcase of Staples\u2019 talents. These Black artists joyously fill the screen with a vision unburdened by needing to be the representative of an entire community, and it\u2019s down to audiences to step into this world and buckle up for a weird and wonderful ride. The Vince Staples Show is on Netflix",

This new one scores highly, partly for the dramatic relish with which the conductor Marc Minkowski and his Musiciens du Louvre dispatch the music, but principally for a tour de force performance in the title role from the mezzo-soprano Magdalena Ko\u017een\u00e1. She keeps the emotional import of the words she sings absolutely front and centre of her delivery, without compromising the shape or sense of the music, and she has fabulous low notes as a bonus. Her two great Act 2 scenes of rejection, vengeance and despair are riveting. She has top-notch support from Erin Morley, who brings a crystalline soprano to Morgana, Alcina\u2019s flightier sister, Elizabeth DeShong\u2019s richly expressive Bradamante, and Anna Bonitatibus, whose dark, agile voice captures Ruggiero\u2019s impetuosity. Minkowski encourages them to decorate the repeats in their arias lavishly from the off, and all rise to the challenge. The three men aren\u2019t quite this sonorous level, but the only real let-down is the physical CD release, which has no synopsis and an English translation of the libretto that\u2019s chock full of misprints, including a god/cod line worthy of my local chippie.

        "body": "All right, let\u2019s get it out of the way: Netflix has a new show with rapper and actor Vince Staples, called The Vince Staples Show (from Thursday 15 February), and there is no way we are getting through this without referencing the fact that it shares some genetic material with rapper and actor-created shows Atlanta (which I loved) and Dave, which I loved right up until the last three minutes of the season three finale (come to think of it, I also hated the entire fifth episode of season three) \u2013 the entire Brad Pitt section! Come on! This isn\u2019t just because all three shows have an actor-rapper in them, by the way. As with Dave, Staples plays a version of himself inflected by fame: people come up to him and recognise him, certain doors are opened and wheels are greased as a result of who he is, he is randomly adored or hated by passersby, and that\u2019s a really interesting and fun texture for a show to have. And, much like Atlanta, there\u2019s a woozy, anything-could-happen quality to what\u2019s going on (an episode set in an off-brand theme park is so Atlanta I did wonder whether they found a rejected script in a big bin behind the studios at FX). Right, I\u2019m glad we cleared that up. This is a good thing, though. A small part of me does rankle against the fact that, for some reason, the only TV writers allowed to create ambitious, meta, surreal TV shows with gorgeous direction have to prove themselves as bestselling music artists first. (If an ordinary \u201cwriter\u201d wrote the first episode of The Vince Staples Show, it would be mushed through a mill of producers who insist on \u201cstory beats\u201d and \u201cperhaps an extra character\u201d and \u201cI want to know more about the girlfriend\u201d: Vince Staples can just say \u201cbut I\u2019m Vince Staples\u201d and shut those conversations down.) The point is, these ambitious shows are actually being made, and they\u2019re being made in such a number and to such a high quality that they are becoming a genre of their own. Sure, for now, Vince Staples is one of the few people on Earth afforded the freedom to make something as lush and weird and meandering as The Vince Staples Show. But the template exists now, and one day someone will be able to make a show like this without having to spend a couple of years in Odd Future first. In the show, Staples plays a deadpan version of himself in a semi-surrealised version of Long Beach, California. (It is simply called the Beach; each episode opens with the words: \u201cThis is a work of fiction. Any similarities to actual events are purely coincidental.\u201d I personally quite like that rappers have reclaimed \u201cbeing a bit pretentious\u201d.) He is deliberately flat and normal while chaos and weirdness unfurls around him. It\u2019s a bit like when a successful Live at the Apollo comedian is given their own BBC Two sitcom, and they always write themselves as The World\u2019s Most Normal Man, and every barista they encounter (it\u2019s always a barista) is a rude maniac, and the only joke is them blinking fast a couple of times and saying \u201cOK\u201d while people contort weirdly next to them. The way Staples does it is far cooler, though, and the weirdness around him tempered adroitly \u2013 it never bulges out into full, unbelievable weird, just something bristling at the edges \u2013 and there is a knot at the centre of his character, a quiet discomfort with his level of fame and the presumption that he\u2019s just a musician, that makes this more interesting than \u201cman with no emotions has difficult interaction with a hospitality worker\u201d. This is not going to be a show for everyone \u2013 it\u2019s quite ambient, one episode is inexplicably only 18 minutes long (why even turn the camera on? Go and write more script!) and sometimes it does stray into a TV pet peeve of mine which is \u201cthings happening with no explanation and no further mention at all\u201d \u2013 but broadly I am just happy that there\u2019s a new, interesting, weird genre of television happening. If this is what rappers are doing then just cut out the middleman and give them all a development deal right now. I want to see what Ice Spice does when given access to a former Top Boy director, a writers\u2019 room full of Princeton graduates, a quarter-million dollar budget and carte blanche to do whatever the hell she feels like. The future of TV is somewhere in that equation, I can feel it.",

        "body": "Capitalism, artificial intelligence, Renaissance history and motherhood are among the topics explored in the books on the inaugural Women\u2019s prize for nonfiction longlist. Sixteen women \u2013 including Guardian US columnist Naomi Klein, Observer art critic Laura Cumming and historian Tiya Miles \u2013 are now in the running for the \u00a330,000 prize, launched last year to redress the relatively low numbers of women recognised in nonfiction prizes. The \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d longlisted titles are \u201cabout redressing wrongs \u2013 so whether that\u2019s exposing truth, or revealing hypocrisy or uncovering hidden stories \u2013 there\u2019s a dedication to truth\u201d, said chair of judges and historian Suzannah Lipscomb. Klein was longlisted for Doppelganger, in which she writes about being mistaken for the feminist writer turned conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf. Prize judge and biographer Anne Sebba said that Doppelganger was \u201csuch a clever book\u201d because Klein \u201ctakes what, on the face of it, is a simple idea of having a double, someone who is frequently thought of as her, but then expands this to construct a dark comedy of a rather terrifying mirror image world\u201d. Miles made the longlist for All That She Carried, a story of slavery centred on a sack that an enslaved woman passes on to her daughter. The book \u201cfinds a way to give voice to the wordless by using a mundane, domestic object \u2013 a cloth sack and its contents \u2013 to thread an extraordinary tale through the generations\u201d, wrote Colin Grant in his Guardian review. The 16 titles will be narrowed down to a shortlist of six, to be announced on 27 March. The winner will be announced alongside the fiction prize on 13 June. Along with the cash prize, the winning author will receive an artwork, known as The Charlotte, created by sculptor Ann Christopher. Cumming was selected for Thunderclap, about the early deaths of Dutch painter Carel Fabritius and Cumming\u2019s father. \u201cI love this book because of the way she intertwines a subtle and tender love of her father with a deep understanding of Dutch art,\u201d said Sebba. Lipscomb noted that many, though not all of the longlisted books feature a \u201cpersonal voice\u201d, weaving academic research with personal reflections. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of owning one\u2019s subjectivity as an author that comes out of these, and I think that might be a zeitgeisty thing \u2013 it might be that if we\u2019d launched this prize 10 years ago, that wouldn\u2019t be the case. But that\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d Other memoiristic titles chosen include Safiya Sinclair\u2019s How to Say Babylon, about growing up Rastafari, and Intervals by Marianne Brooker, about her mother\u2019s illness and death. The launch of the nonfiction prize came in the wake of research commissioned by the Women\u2019s prize that found that only 35% of books awarded a nonfiction prize over the past 10 years were written by women, across seven UK nonfiction prizes. While the longlist was made up of \u201cbrilliant\u201d books across \u201ceconomics and technology and science and history and investigative journalism\u201d, said Lipscomb, \u201cthere were fewer books submitted in some of these areas than one might have hoped, and perhaps fewer books submitted in adjacent areas, like philosophy, literary criticism, geopolitics, mathematics, sports\u201d. Lipscomb hopes that the prize will encourage publishers to \u201cinvest in female writers writing in these fields\u201d. Also on the longlist are The Dictionary People by Sarah Ogilvie, The Britannias by Alice Albinia, Vulture Capitalism by Grace Blakeley, Eve by Cat Bohannon, Shadows at Noon by Joya Chatterji, Some People Need Killing by Patricia Evangelista, Wifedom by Anna Funder, Matrescence by Lucy Jones, Flat Place by Noreen Masud, Code Dependent by Madhumita Murgia and Young Queens by Leah Redmond Chang. This year\u2019s prize was open to books published in the UK between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. Alongside Lipscomb and Sebba on the judging panel are fair fashion campaigner Venetia La Manna, author Nicola Rollock, and winner of the 2018 Women\u2019s prize for fiction Kamila Shamsie.

His daughter Emily\u2019s tastes are a bit different. She\u2019s a diehard Swiftie and Caldwell spent countless hours trying to secure a ticket to Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras tour for Emily so she could have the same formative experience seeing her favourite band at 15. They\u2019d had no luck landing a ticket amid unprecedented demand but that changed on Thursday night at a pub in Echuca in regional Victoria. About 100 local Swifties had gathered for a Taylor Swift trivia night and to find out who would win a sought-after prize \u2013 a ticket the Echuca hotel had been gifted by a corporate connection to an Eras tour show in Sydney. Almost 800 people had entered the competition. Emily had come to the pub with her family and her wrists covered in friendship bracelets to hand out. She danced the hardest and sang the loudest to Taylor Swift covers played during the night by a local act. Emily didn\u2019t win but Molly Davis \u2013 who organised the event and was taken by Emily\u2019s enthusiasm for Swift \u2013 had a few other ideas to get her to the concert on Sunday 25 February. \u201cI was sitting with my friends and we\u2019re all big Swifties and we kept saying to each other that if we won it we would give it to [Emily] because she was such a dedicated fan and we all really wanted to see her go,\u201d Davis said.

A friend had a spare ticket \u2013 a restricted view that went on sale on Tuesday to a show in Sydney \u2013 that wasn\u2019t needed so they decided to offer it to Emily. \u201cAs soon as I told her she was going, she burst into tears. Her mum was crying, her dad was crying \u2026 her sister was like, \u2018thank you so much for making my sister\u2019s day\u2019,\u201d Davis recalled on Friday. \u201cMe and my friends are all 2006 Swifties, we\u2019re all going. It\u2019s so nice to see another generation getting so much joy from her and to be able to share that.\u201d Caldwell said he could not contain his emotions when he realised Emily would get the chance to see Swift. \u201cIt took me straight back to my first concert and how special it was. The memories from it, it\u2019s something you never forget. But the way she got the ticket \u2013 it will just be a lifetime memory for her.\u201d",

        "body": "Whenever I talk about sunscreen in winter, I\u2019m invariably scolded by someone about our need for vitamin D. And I do understand it. In Britain, we\u2019re almost all of us deficient in vitamin D during the colder months (many of us in summer, too). Low vitamin D has been linked to myriad health complaints, from mild to life-threatening. But while it sounds commonsensical, skipping sun protection to increase your vitamin D level is highly risky, and has had limited success and fallen flat under scrutiny so far. There are far safer ways to obtain vitamin D (from supplements or, better still, a balanced diet) than by subjecting skin cells to UVA radiation, which makes up about 95% of the UV rays that reach our skin, and doesn\u2019t even cause vitamin D synthesis. What UVA does do is destroy collagen; cause sun damage, uneven pigmentation and slackening; and play a role in some cancers. UVB, on the other hand, does help produce vitamin D, but it also burns skin, causes cancers and makes up only 5% of our exposure anyway. To chase UV rays in order to top up vitamin D levels is as sensible as swigging gin to obtain vital fluids. I see how easy it is to look at a dull, grey day and assume the sun could do no possible harm. But UVA is present in all daylight (even when you\u2019re sitting in a room or car next to a window) and if we find the right SPF product for our lifestyles, skin types and effort levels, there\u2019s no logical reason not to wear one daily. It\u2019s for this reason that I advocate the use of facial moisturisers containing SPF. As long as they\u2019re applied in sufficient quantities (squeezed along the full length of your index and middle fingers to apply to the face and neck), they\u2019ll protect and reduce faff on busy winter mornings. My favourite ever is Medik8\u2019s Advanced Day Ultimate Protect (\u00a359), which is suitable for all skin types, behaves beautifully under makeup and doesn\u2019t sting my eyes, but it does cost a fortune. L\u2019Oreal\u2019s brand new Bright Reveal Dark Spot Hydrating Cream SPF50 (\u00a329.99) is a pleasure to use and should not be the sole reserve of those with pigmentation problems, since its active pigment-tackling ingredient is niacinamide, from which all of us benefit anyway. Niacinamide is also included in CeraVe\u2019s AM Facial Moisturising Lotion SPF50 (\u00a316.50). Its creamy, ceramide-rich texture feels comfy and cosseting on parched, wintry skin.",

        "body": "If you forced me to choose my favourite wine, it would have to be white burgundy. At its best \u2013 and these days it is a ruinously expensive pastime \u2013 it\u2019s a simply thrilling experience that reminds you why wine is such an incredibly special drink. Ethereal, creamy and with a crisp acidity that makes it a perfect partner for seafood, white burgundy is an absolute joy. And, after a run of tricky vintages, the 2022 is not only good, but plentiful \u2013 though sadly that doesn\u2019t mean prices have gone down; rather that they just haven\u2019t gone up much higher. The 22s are already in the shops, and most of the affordable ones come from the M\u00e2connais, the region to the south, though bar a few exceptions I don\u2019t find them as exciting, and too much like chardonnay you can find cheaper elsewhere. That said, the 22s are more in balance, with a fresh acidity that counterbalances the richness. (If you share my view, look for wines of 13% ABV or under that don\u2019t have the word \u201cchardonnay\u201d on the label, because that often flags up a more international style.) Chablis from the northern end of the region is particularly delicious this year, but it has got expensive. It\u2019s still not like chardonnay from anywhere else, though. Petit chablis, which you might assume meant lesser quality, simply refers to wines made from vines grown outside the officially recognised Chablis region, and it, too, can be excellent, as proven by the Domaine Dampt wine in today\u2019s pick. It\u2019s also worth looking out for less well-known appellations that don\u2019t carry the same price tag as the more famous ones: Auxey-Duresses and Pernand-Vergelesses, for example. Aligot\u00e9, Burgundy\u2019s other white wine grape, is also a more affordable option, and many good producers are making it now. If you want one of the better growers, however, the best buy is a basic bourgogne blanc, though even that can be pricey. I swooned over Dominique Lafon\u2019s, which are available from Berry Bros &amp; Rudd (in the unlikely event they have any left). You will most likely have to buy them en primeur, which means you pay for the wine upfront minus tax and duty, which are payable on delivery in about a year\u2019s time. Wine merchants\u2019 generic white burgundy tends to be more affordable, with the added advantage that the 22s are available right now: Adnams and Tanner\u2019s are two I\u2019d recommend. Finally, you\u2019ll be far better off drinking your white burgundy at home, rather than in a restaurant (unless you\u2019re doing BYO), because restaurant mark-ups on the stuff tend to be more than a little cheeky. Five (just about) affordable white burgundies Domaine Dampt Petit Chablis Vieilles Vignes 2022 \u00a319.99 (or \u00a314.99 by the mixed case) Laithwaites, 12.5%. Disregard the \u2018petit\u2019: this has all the quality of a good chablis. Booth\u2019s White Burgundy Chardonnay 2022 \u00a313.25, 13%. Exemplary basic white burgundy, and arguably the best-value wine in this lineup. The same store\u2019s 12.5% chablis at \u00a315 is terrific, too. The Wine Society\u2019s Generation Series M\u00e2con-Villages \u00a316.50, 13%. One of the highlights of the first tranche of a new range that celebrates the Society\u2019s 150th anniversary. Fresher, crisper and more elegant than many m\u00e2cons. Classy. Bourgogne Aligot\u00e9 Comte Armand 2022 \u00a3111 by the six-bottle case (in bond) Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, 12.5%. If you like chablis you\u2019ll love pure, pristine aligot\u00e9. Especially with oysters or sashimi. Limited supplies, though. Drouhin Vaudon Chablis 2022 \u00a327.50 (or \u00a324.75 for a mixed case of 12) Great Wine Co, 12.5%. Surprisingly intense for such a young wine, delicately creamy and elegant. Will only get better over the next couple of years. For more by Fiona Beckett, go to fionabeckett.substack.com",

        "body": "As well as everything else, this wonderfully sweet and funny film will contribute to the debate about whether repressive regimes are the nursery of artistic greatness. The Iranian government has prevented the film\u2019s two directors, Maryam Moghaddam and Behtash Sanaeeha, from travelling to Berlin to attend their own premiere; six months ago, their production offices were raided and computers and hard drives confiscated. But, fortunately, the police couldn\u2019t find the film itself, whose gentle humanity is a compelling rebuke to this fatuous, clumsy repression. If I had to guess, I would say that the authorities had got wind of a particular scene in which the morality police drive self-importantly around a Tehran park in their van, intimidating young women who are allegedly not wearing their hijabs with enough modesty. The 70-year-old heroine \u2013 who wistfully remembers a time when hijabs were not required at all \u2013 stands up to these uniformed bullies and rescues a woman from their clutches. This is Mahin (a lovely performance from Lili Farhadpour), whose story is a meditation on love and loss, loneliness and old age, and on the price at which long-term married happiness is bought. It is a meditation on how women come to terms with the destiny of widowhood, of knowing that they will almost certainly outlive their husbands. Mahin is herself a widow whose daughter and grandchildren live abroad, and her muted existence alone in her apartment is revealed in a series of tremendously composed tableaux. There are FaceTime phone calls with her daughter which somehow never allow for a proper talk. She has difficulty getting to sleep and doesn\u2019t get up before noon. She waters the plants in her garden, goes shopping and occasionally hosts lunches for her female friends, at which the dominant theme is everyone\u2019s various ailments, discussed at hilarious and explicit length. But the conversation turns to whether it is possible to find romance again at their age. Why not? And so Mahin, without quite admitting it to herself, expands and modifies her aimless daytime schedule with a secret end in view: to meet a man. Mahin hangs out in the bakery queue, at the park, at a fancy hotel coffee shop and finally at a modest restaurant where pensioners\u2019 food vouchers can be redeemed. And she finds herself meeting cute with Faramarz (Esmaeel Mehrabi), a modest, personable single man of her age. He is a cab driver and military veteran, who himself is of Mahin\u2019s independent cast of mind: he got into trouble with joyless authorities for playing a musical instrument in a wedding band. And so Faramarz and Mahin have their moment together at her apartment, where she offers to bake him her favourite cake. It is a moment of emotional connection for which they have saved up all their thoughts and feelings since becoming single \u2013 as if the entirety of their late-life inner existences are now being poured out to each other. There is something quietly magnificent in it. Moments like these in life are poignantly brief \u2013 but many never have them at all. It\u2019s a lovely film. \u2022 My Favourite Cake was shown at the Berlin film festival.",

        "body": "NatWest made its biggest annual profit last year since the 2007 financial crisis, helped by high interest rates, as the bank confirmed the interim boss, Paul Thwaite, would permanently take over as its chief executive before a public sale of its government-owned shares. The UK lender \u2013 which is still 35% government-owned \u2013 said pre-tax profits rose 20% to \u00a36.2bn in the year to December. That is higher than analyst forecasts for \u00a36bn, and marks its largest annual profit recorded since it made \u00a310bn in 2007, the year before excesses led to a \u00a345.5bn public rescue that has yet to be fully unwound 16 years later. Bumper profits in 2023 came as the bank made more money from loans and mortgages, compared with what it paid to savers, after another year of interest rate increases by the Bank of England. Those earnings, known as net interest income, rose 12% to \u00a311bn. It sent NatWest shares up more than 5%, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. The bank\u2019s bonus pool for bankers fell 3% to \u00a3356m despite the jump in profits. NatWest said this reflected the impact on shareholders, after the bank missed previous earnings guidance. Shareholders will receive a \u00a31bn payout, with a final dividend worth 11.5p a share, and have a chance to take part in a \u00a3300m share buyback programme. The earnings results will set a high benchmark for Thwaite, who NatWest confirmed on Friday would take over permanently as chief executive with immediate effect, running the bank alongside the incoming chair, Rick Haythornthwaite. Thwaite was paid \u00a31.7m pay package for the year, including a \u00a3245,000 cash bonus, and other benefits such as \u00a321,000 for business travel and \u00a31,700 for home security. Thwaite, who previously ran NatWest\u2019s business banking division, took over as the interim chief executive in July after his predecessor, Alison Rose, was forced to quit over a debanking row with Nigel Farage. Thwaite\u2019s appointment will help pave the way for government plans to sell shares in NatWest to the general public later this year, after the state agency that manages the taxpayer stake said the market needed reassurance on NatWest\u2019s leadership before going ahead. The debanking controversy started when Coutts \u2013 the NatWest-owned private bank for the ultra-wealthy \u2013 planned to shut Farage\u2019s bank accounts, and snowballed after Farage obtained internal documents that showed the bank had concerns over his political views. The scandal escalated when it emerged that Rose had discussed Farage\u2019s case with a BBC journalist. Rose was forced to forgo \u00a37.6m in pay from NatWest, although independent lawyers hired by the bank concluded she had made an \u201can honest mistake\u201d in speaking with the BBC and that concerns over Farage\u2019s political views were not the driving factor in the decision to shut his accounts. While the jump in earnings will be a relief after a tumultuous year, there are signs that profit growth could slow. NatWest warned that total income was expected to drop to \u00a313bn-\u00a313.5bn in 2024, from \u00a314.8bn this year, adding: \u201cThe economic outlook remains uncertain.\u201d The bank\u2019s forecasts point to a drop in inflation to 2.5% by the end of 2024 \u2013 from 4% now \u2013 leading to a cut in interest rates to 4% from current levels of 5.25%, which could put pressure on net interest income. Thwaite said the encouraging news on inflation was also being offset by other factors, including the government\u2019s removal of energy bill support and the fact that millions of homeowners were still set to roll off fixed mortgage terms on to higher rates. That bank had seen customers try to \u201ctake more control of their spending\u201d and were supplementing their income, including through cashback sites and secondhand shops online. However, Thwaite said the bank was going into 2024 \u201cfocused on the things we can control; delivering profitable growth, becoming more efficient, more productive, and simpler to deal with, while managing our cost and capital efficiently. Together, these actions will drive long-term, sustainable value for our customers, shareholders, and the wider UK economy.\u201d",

        "body": "Too bad that Emma Beddington used her one-stop eating experience to denounce eating food by the bowl or, as it\u2019s called here, \u201cbowlification\u201d (Food should be tasty, and it doesn\u2019t have to come in a bowl. Could someone tell my lovely American hosts?, 12 February). I grew up eating food by the bowl. Memories abound of my eight-year-old self eating breakfast congee mixed with salted duck egg, minced pickled cabbage, and freshly chopped aromatic herbs, or swallowing down gentle, slightly salted and ginger-flavoured congee when I was sick. Or as a young college student out and about with my mates enjoying our late-night bowls of hearty curry, pho, or slurpy ramen topped with slow-cooked pork belly and tempura eggplant and prawns. More importantly to us, the food was affordable, delicious and filling. As an American, I realise that I don\u2019t have the highly refined taste of the British palate to judge from. I have no gastronomical training except learning how to cook by my parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 elbow. I doubt if I\u2019ve eaten at a Michelin-star restaurant or can afford to. One thing I can afford is a good bowl of great food. Whether enjoying a shimmering wine-reduced beef stew on cold nights or slaying my way through bowls of udon, congee, ramen, pho, peanut stew or poke with family and friends, I can say with some experience that food by the bowl is a treasure to savour. That for generations, billions of people around the world seemed to love \u201cbowlification\u201d is palate proof that we can\u2019t be all wrong. NC Doyle Seattle, Washington, US \u2022 What a superb commentary by Emma Beddington on the latest bowl food phenomenon. I especially loved the last line about leaving full, but also empty. This Gwyneth Paltrow, Marie Kondo, Gillian McKeith obsession with \u201ccultifying\u201d every aspect of our lives is so joyless and devoid of pleasure, I wonder why anyone follows it at all. As my dear other half says: \u201cI don\u2019t want a bloody lecture, I just want me dinner!\u201d I won\u2019t even tell you how he describes Michelin joints and tasting menus. Suffice it to say, he\u2019s banned us from going to a couple up here in Yorkshire. Lizzie Rymer Huddersfield, West Yorkshire \u2022 Criticism of American bowls of nourishing but soulless food ignites a fire in my belly. The vast majority of Americans cannot afford the luxury of such complete nutrition. Indeed, our counterparts across the Atlantic seem to thrill at mockery of the fast food that has somehow become too luxurious for many here. To frown on undoubtedly expensive, nutritious food is a very \u201clet them eat cake\u201d sentiment. I am confident that the article wasn\u2019t meant to be punching down. Maybe if the critical fun was levelled at a specific genre of food in the title instead of \u201cAmericans\u201d, it would strike a better chord. Jesse Shepherd Etowah, North Carolina, US \u2022 The Boston food circle that Emma Beddington describes with such contempt has no bearing on the culinary delights of the Boston that I know and love. Countless wonderful restaurants would happily welcome you to try the tasty local fish, delight your palate with fresh oysters in abundance and serve you the best cod in beer batter ever tasted. My advice is don\u2019t dine with frat boys, and if you must eat from a bowl, might I suggest you try clam chowder? Sandra Hall Chesterfield, Derbyshire \u2022 I have lived in the US for a long time although I still have a British passport. I read Emma Beddington\u2019s rather sarcastic review of her food experience with a mixture of amusement and puzzlement. She seems to confuse a new-age fast-food experience with typical American cuisine, which is a bit like saying that because a chippie served its fried fish and chips in a newspaper, all British food is served that way. I know when I get food from a place like the one she mentioned that I am trading speed and convenience for ambience and pleasant dining. When I go to restaurants with linens, cutlery and plates, I typically experience the ambience and the pleasant experience she missed. Robert L Moore Atlanta, Georgia, US \u2022 I\u2019m Californian, but have lived in the UK for nearly 20 years. I always find it baffling when British folks go to one US city and then characterise it to apply to the entire US. It seems the same as an American eating haggis in Edinburgh and then suggesting that all British people eat it regularly. I was just visiting the US midwest last week \u2013 there was hardly a veggie in sight, let alone entire bowls of it.

        "body": "20. Commodores \u2013 Let\u2019s Do It Right (1975) Bizarre as it now seems, the most obvious influence on Richie\u2019s early songs for Commodores was Sly Stone. You can hear the inspiration from the Family Stone in 1974\u2019s There\u2019s a Song in My Heart, while the next year\u2019s charming Let\u2019s Do It Right carries a hint of Everybody Is a Star in its DNA. 19. Love Will Conquer All (1986) Another huge hit, Dancing on the Ceiling from 1986 was nevertheless a less assured album than its predecessor. The title track is no All Night Long and Ballerina Girl is the point where Richie finally gets too MOR to defend. But the album has its moments, including Love Will Conquer All\u2019s supremely assured, super-slick pop-R&amp;B. 18. Up All Night (2006) Richie\u2019s later albums are a decidedly mixed bag \u2013 be warned you have to put in the hours while hunting for the gold. But Up All Night, from 2006\u2019s Coming Home, is great, eschewing Richie\u2019s quiet storm comfort zone for stammering, up-tempo 00s R&amp;B, through which his voice glides with impressive ease. 17. Commodores \u2013 Too Hot ta Trot (1977) Unlike many of their peers, Commodores didn\u2019t plunge into disco. Too Hot ta Trot turned up on the soundtrack to the disco movie Thank God It\u2019s Friday, but it applies their own method of getting bodies moving. There is a distinct whiff of Stone\u2019s Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) in the mix. 16. Say You, Say Me (1985) Richie was commissioned to write a theme for White Nights on the condition it shared the movie\u2019s title. Instead, he submitted Say You, Say Me, a smart move that uncoupled the song from the film in the public imagination. For something apparently recorded in his living room, it\u2019s impressively epic, complete with a dramatic tempo change. 15. Commodores \u2013 Sail On (1979) The intro to Sail On suggests a band trying a bit too hard to replicate the success of Three Times a Lady, but the song is better than that. It has a gorgeous, sighing melody with \u2013 for the first, but not the last, time in Richie\u2019s oeuvre \u2013 the noticeable influence of country amid the strings, horns and pattering congas. 14. Can\u2019t Slow Down (1983) Running With the Night was the hit, but Can\u2019t Slow Down\u2019s best up-tempo offering was the title track\u2019s jittery electronic funk. It was influenced by Michael Jackson\u2019s Wanna Be Startin\u2019 Somethin\u2019, but is noticeably more unruffled in its vocal delivery, projecting Richie as a man who never breaks a sweat, even at his most urgent. 13. Commodores \u2013 Free (1975) In Commodores, Richie mostly wrote and sang the slow numbers, leaving the funk material to the drummer, Walter Orange. Mostly, but not always: 1975\u2019s Movin\u2019 On opens with two horn-powered Richie co-writes, of which Free, with its rock-influenced chorus, is the pick. 12. Deep River Woman (1986) If the 10m-selling Can\u2019t Slow Down was Richie\u2019s answer to Thriller, its follow-up, Dancing on the Ceiling, was Richie\u2019s take on Bad, designed to emulate Jackson\u2019s genre-busting success. But Richie went about it differently, as shown by Deep River Woman, which eschews courting a rock audience in favour of collaborating with the country institution Alabama. 11. Commodores \u2013 Sweet Love (1975) Sweet Love was Richie\u2019s first hit ballad \u2013 No 5 in the US Billboard chart \u2013 but it was a noticeably different kind of ballad from the super-slick songs that ultimately made him a superstar. Orchestrated, but driven by electric guitar, its gospel-influenced style is noticeably \u2013 and appealingly \u2013 tougher and rougher round the edges. 10. Hello (1983) Try to detach Hello (released as a single in 1984, a few months after it debuted on Can\u2019t Slow Down) from its video, with Richie\u2019s hammy acting, its questionable plotline \u2013 is it 100% ethical for a teacher to be romantically pursuing a blind student? \u2013 and, indeed, its inadvertently hilarious grand reveal. A tough call, for sure, but stick with it: a nailed-on ballad lurks behind it. 9. Commodores \u2013 Fancy Dancer (1976) If you want an impressive co-sign, Fancy Dancer was subsequently covered (but never officially released) by Prince. You can see why he might have been drawn to it: written by Richie and the bassist Ronald LaPread, it\u2019s less celebrated than Brick House, but just as funky, in a low-slung way. 8. Stuck on You (1984) His 2012 album with the Nashville superstars Tuskegee made Richie\u2019s affinity with country music explicit, although it had been an undercurrent in his music for years. You don\u2019t have to squint hard to picture Stuck on You as a straight country ballad; indeed, the Tuskegee version (with Darius Rucker) simply adds pedal steel to the arrangement. 7. Commodores \u2013 Zoom (1977) Overshadowed by the presence of Easy and Brick House on the same, eponymous album, Zoom is nevertheless fantastic: a product of a time when Richie\u2019s ballads were still rooted in soul music. It features a muted but powerful orchestral arrangement, with a hint of syncopation about the rhythm track and blissful harmonies. 6. Endless Love (1981) The duet version, with Diana Ross, was a huge hit, but head instead to Richie\u2019s original demo \u2013 appended to the reissue of his 1982 eponymous debut solo album \u2013 which strips the song of its blockbusting movie-theme qualities, revealing something more intimate, tender and affecting at its centre. 5. Commodores \u2013 Lady (You Bring Me Up) (1981) Richie\u2019s last big hit with Commodores was released almost simultaneously with Endless Love, the single that marked the start of his solo career. They couldn\u2019t be more different: Lady is sophisticated, string-laden, post-disco boogie, fabulous enough to make you wish Richie had incorporated at least a hint of this style in his solo career. 4. Commodores \u2013 Brick House (1977) Perhaps Brick House shouldn\u2019t be on this list \u2013 Richie neither sang nor wrote Commodores\u2019 most celebrated funk hit \u2013 but let\u2019s bend the rules, because a) he made a pretty good fist of performing it solo on his 2007 live album and b) Commodores\u2019 version is amazing: a lascivious order to dance. 3. Commodores \u2013 Three Times a Lady (1978) That Commodores\u2019 first No 1 was a waltz, which Richie initially intended to submit to Frank Sinatra, tells you a lot about how far from their roots the band had travelled, but no matter: millions of singles were shifted and Richie\u2019s future direction was mapped out. 2. All Night Long (All Night) (1983) The biggest-selling and best single from Can\u2019t Slow Down was a rare diversion from the lovestruck end-of-the-night slow dance soundtracks that were its primary currency. You would struggle to describe it as funk or soul music, but there is something irresistible about its combination of mood-setting, dusk-falling atmosphere and monster chorus. 1. Commodores \u2013 Easy (1977) There are diehard R&amp;B fans who will tell you that Richie was the ruination of Commodores, his pop leanings and focus on ballads gradually dragging a tough funk band irrevocably towards the middle of the road. Their gradual shift in focus \u2013 and Richie\u2019s role in it \u2013 is inarguable, but when his melodic powers were at full force, it scarcely mattered. Easy is a fantastic song, smooth local-radio staple or not. It\u2019s beautifully written, the melody and the loping rhythm perfectly capturing the lyric\u2019s peculiar emotional cocktail \u2013 blithe indifference with a twist of guilt and regret.",

        "body": "When Taylor Swift first played in Melbourne 15 years ago, it was to an audience of 900. This week in the city, the US megastar performs for a quarter of a million. Love her or hate her, there\u2019s no denying it: Australia is in the thick of Swiftmania. Leading up to the hotly anticipated Australian leg of Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, Melbourne was lit up with it all, from a Swift-themed academic symposium to a pop-up merchandise stand at Crown, to a projection on Flinders Street Station welcoming Swifties to town \u2013 with the clock striking 13, naturally. It feels historic. What other musician has inspired this level of fanaticism since, dare I say it, the Beatles? We\u2019re talking seismic impacts from cheering at her shows, and the growing practice of Taylor-gating, in which ticketless fans gather outside the stadium to listen in and sing along together. The Eras Tour \u2013 the highest-grossing concert tour of all time (of all time!) \u2013 has been a fascinating beast to watch from afar. Moving through the stages of Swift\u2019s chameleonic career, it\u2019s smartly designed for maximum engagement. Each night Swift plays an essentially identical setlist bar two \u201csurprise songs\u201d. A concert film was released in October, so most fans know exactly what to expect (and have learned all the dances and chants from TikTok). The excitement is palpable and the atmosphere electric at the MCG on the first of her seven Australian shows. With 96,000 fans in attendance, it\u2019s the biggest show of the tour \u2013 and her career \u2013 yet. Thousands of strangers become instant friends inside and outside the show. Young women swap handmade friendship bracelets and compliment each other\u2019s outfits, often elaborate and handmade. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who feels my inner child healing \u2013 to paraphrase Swift herself, it gives me back my girlhood. The show itself is an eye-popping spectacle and completely engrossing \u2013 it clocks in at an impressive three and a half hours, but flies by. The singer dips into each of her albums \u2013 other than 2006\u2019s self-titled album (justice for Debut!) \u2013 which are represented by distinctive outfits and personalities: the dreamy hues of Lover, the gold of Fearless, the earthy, bucolic Folklore and Evermore, the gritty edge of Reputation, the princess gowns of Speak Now, the passion of Red, the metropolitan cool of 1989, the glitz and glam of Midnights. Each fan receives a wristband, which flashes in colours to match the era. Moving platforms, stairs and intricate sets \u2013 a forest seance for Evermore, a log cabin for Folklore \u2013 and a slick team of tightly choreographed dancers (including internet sensation Kameron Saunders, on fire as always) ensure there is always something to marvel at. Pyrotechnics, enormous smoke machines and fireworks \u2013 par for the course at this stage. Swift is a generous, genuine performer. Much of her audience banter is scripted, but there\u2019s nothing fake about the tears she sheds as she surveys the enormous crowd after Champagne Problems. Her stamina is incredible and her voice in fine form, but never better than on the evening\u2019s two highlights, the 10-minute version of All Too Well and the live debut of You\u2019re Losing Me on piano \u2013 breakup songs so vivid and emotional that screaming along with her and tens of thousands of others, I almost forgot I\u2019m in a happy relationship. It\u2019s pure joy. So much of the Eras Tour is fan service, from the inclusion of fan anthem Long Live (added later in the tour) to Easter eggs and iconic Swift moments, such as the Fearless spin. In the sweetest moment of each night, a fan \u2013 usually a child \u2013 is handed a hat off Swift\u2019s head during her performance of 22. This is a fan base who can spot even the slightest difference in a performance \u2013 a single note change in The 1 draws rapturous cheers, and a spirited shout in the chorus of The Last Great American Dynasty feels like it\u2019s just for us. The Eras Tour is, Swift says, for new fans and those who have been there since the very beginning. Judging by the number of millennial mothers and their young daughters, it\u2019s become intergenerational. The feeling really is one of inclusion and love \u2013 the show somehow feels simultaneously massive and like the most intimate thing in the world. On the crowded walk back into the city after the show, a busker sings You Belong With Me and we all sing along. Swift\u2019s refrain from All Too Well echoes in my head: I was there, I was there. When I woke up this morning, my wristband was still flashing colours above my bed, as if to say: yes, you were.",

        "body": "Tasmania offers practically endless options for a unique holiday. Whether you\u2019re a thrill-seeking adventurer, ravenous foodie or history buff, Australia\u2019s island state is the perfect place to embrace an experience you\u2019ve never had before. And if your ideal trip involves simply resting and reconnecting with nature, Tasmania\u2019s bespoke accommodation hosts are ready to show you what their beloved home state \u2013 and its abundance of natural wonders \u2013 has to offer. A restorative stay for every guest Instagram: @Tasmanian_shacklife Naomi Hume is the creator of the accommodation listings site Tasmanian Shacklife, a sensory delight that introduces visitors to some of the island\u2019s best stays \u2013 from the rugged west coast to the picturesque east and everywhere in between. As a local, Hume has a simple wish: to give every visitor to Tasmania the best possible experience. \u201cAll of my shack stays are immersive enough for people to go, \u2018I just want to picture myself here\u2019,\u201d she says. Naomi Hume, creator of Tasmanian Shacklife \u201cNinety per cent were the host\u2019s own home or shack that they\u2019ve turned into a space they share with others. It isn\u2019t just a typical Airbnb \u2013 it offers something else. It might be timber, washed-up driftwood, beautiful cups of tea, and Tasmanian gins and whiskies. But then there\u2019s also fishing rods and a jetty at the doorstep.\u201d That\u2019s exactly the website\u2019s vibe. Visitors will find choices ranging from a restored sandstone cottage to a tin shed in the mountains to a converted fishing hut by the wild sea. Each one offers a unique perspective on Tasmania\u2019s diverse landscapes, wildlife and experiences. \u201cI think the term shacklife is quite Tasmanian,\u201d Hume says. \u201cEverywhere is what you make it, but you can really make it in Tassie. If you put your feet on the ground here, you\u2019ll see it for yourself.\u201d If this sounds like the lush, rejuvenating holiday you\u2019re after, here are some of the island\u2019s best spots to make it happen. Sheepwash Bay Bruny Island Photograph: @milesunchartered and @sheepwashbay Jenene Oates and her partner, John Bullock, were already living off-grid on Bruny Island before they decided to host visitors. \u201cChoosing to share the space with others has forced us to distill and concentrate the essence [of the place], and present it in a user-friendly way,\u201d Oates says. \u201cThis has, in turn, led us to appreciate living simply in nature.\u201d Their property at Sheepwash Bay offers guests two ways to enjoy this wild coastline: The Hide, a private, luxurious tiny house, and The Shack, a cabin built from reclaimed timbers, with French doors that open to breathtaking views. \u201cWe decided we\u2019d really like to do something that encourages people to dip their toe into a natural experience from a place of comfort,\u201d Oates says. \u201cThe Hide is very close to the water. Sitting down there, watching seagulls and wedgetails and dolphins, you can actually have \u2026 we call it \u2018the David Attenborough moments\u2019.\u201d Bullock, AKA the Bruny Baker, is also behind the local attraction the Bread Fridge, which he keeps freshly stocked with wood-fired loaves to top off the perfect visit. White Cottage North Hobart If you\u2019re a more cosmopolitan visitor, White Cottage is a slice of serenity in the heart of Hobart, within easy reach of some of Tasmania\u2019s most iconic arts, entertainment and food experiences. This 1900s Federation cottage is packed with historical features, including ornate fireplaces, oak floors built from local timber, and a heritage-listed chimney, while also offering a modern kitchen and luxurious deep bath. White Cottage feels like a secluded escape from the daily routine, but it\u2019s only a 15-minute walk from Hobart\u2019s city centre, making it the ideal jumping-off point for visiting Mona, hitting the bustling North Hobart restaurant strip, or heading into the markets at Salamanca. Instagram: @white_cottage_hobart The Eco Cabin Deloraine Stunning Deloraine is known for its crafts, and hosts Tasmania\u2019s annual craft fair every November. It\u2019s here, close to the Meander River, that you\u2019ll also find The Eco Cabin. Scandi-inspired, this luxury accommodation can be found on one of Deloraine\u2019s oldest properties, complete with heritage hawthorn brambles, century-old dry stone walls, and uninterrupted views to Quamby Bluff and the Great Western Tiers. But this new A-frame cabin is also packed with modern comforts, from keyless smart-lock entry to programmable electric blankets \u2013 all with the latest eco technology. Spend your nights relaxing under the stars in the outdoor mineral hot tub, or retire in front of the fire with a book from the cabin\u2019s hidden library. Instagram: @ecocabintasmania Aplite House Friendly Beaches Instagram: @aplite_house After each guest ends their stay at Aplite House, Sam and Tamzen Brewster race to see what\u2019s been written in their guest book. This modern sanctuary sits amid 80 hectares of Tasmanian forest, along the Great Eastern Drive, between Coles Bay and Bicheno. It\u2019s fringed on three sides by Freycinet National Park, and is close to beaches; it\u2019s easy to see why visitors are drawn to this idyllic location. \u201cIt\u2019s immersed in Tasmania\u2019s east coast wilderness,\u201d Sam says. He says designing and creating the house was fascinating and enjoyable, involving plenty of thought, research and planning alongside physical work \u201cand heaps of fun\u201d. Now, he and Tamzen welcome guests to enjoy their completely solar-powered, self-catered escape \u2013 which they might find themselves sharing with a Tassie devil, wombat or quoll. \u201cWe love running Aplite as eco accommodation,\u201d Sam says. \u201cSharing such a restorative and regenerative space is extremely rewarding and enriching for us, especially through the feedback guests provide about how rejuvenated they feel.\u201d In typical Tasmanian fashion, creating a space that connects people with nature has also strengthened Sam and Tamzen\u2019s ties to the world. \u201cIt\u2019s opened up our global view while at the same time established amazing local connections,\u201d Sam says.

        "body": "It used to be that, if you were still happily coupled into your 60s, you would be together for ever. But that has changed: now, mine is the group ever more likely to be splitting up. Between 2002 and 2022, the number of over-65s getting divorced each year in England and Wales more than tripled, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics. What has happened? Partly, it\u2019s about life expectancy increasing and life opportunities expanding when we retire. That is positive, because what it says is: \u201cI\u2019ve still got enough life to look forward to and I want it to be as happy and fulfilling as possible.\u201d The truth is \u2013 and, as a woman in her 60s, I see this all around \u2013 that some couples have evolved a convenient cohabiting arrangement that lacks intimacy and compassion. Then, suddenly, it\u2019s no longer convenient: the adult children, who tend to stay at home longer than they used to, eventually go and the day of reckoning arrives. As at any stage of a relationship, the crux is whether being with a person enhances your life, or detracts from it. If it\u2019s the second, is it \u2013 through therapy and changed behaviour \u2013 mendable? To which another caveat could be added: is the mend worth the pain and effort? Sometimes, the answer is no. \u201cIt might be time to split,\u201d says the couples and psychosexual therapist Tamara Hoyton. \u201cIt might be a case of: \u2018The children are financially independent and I\u2019m bored with you. This relationship holds no spice and I\u2019m running out of life.\u2019\u201d But no path is pain-free and, for many of us sixtysomethings, the hurt of staying in a relationship is less than that we would experience dismantling it. Of course, if you feel you have something to build on, then it\u2019s all to play for; I have been married for 35 years and I would say the past five have been our happiest. Looking back, you can see how often you were both just rattling on, heads down, coping with demanding young kids and then demanding older kids, alongside career pressures and financial worries. But life is not over yet \u2013 and the road ahead may be as bumpy as the road travelled. Retirement brings challenges. It\u2019s a huge life shift that affects our sense of self, our sense of autonomy, our perceived power within our relationships and \u2013 just as importantly \u2013 how to spend our time. \u201cPeople tend not to think enough about how retirement will affect them as a couple,\u201d says Hoyton. \u201cSo, she says: \u2018I\u2019m going to become the chair of governors at the local school,\u2019 and he says: \u2018I thought we were going on lots of golfing holidays.\u2019 Don\u2019t assume your partner will have the same ideas as you about the future. Talk about it.\u201d Think about balance: you will still need time apart, as well as time together. One thing to keep in mind, says Hoyton, is that retirement isn\u2019t one-dimensional. There are probably more possibilities within it than ever before. \u201cIt can be as exciting as you want,\u201d she says. Flexibility, as at any stage of a relationship, is crucial. If you are willing to think creatively, you will reap the rewards. Know, too, that age is no barrier to your need for closeness, companionship, intimacy and fun. \u201cToo many people think they\u2019ve gone past the time when they should be having a happy sex life or exciting nights out,\u201d says Dr Tara Quinn-Cirillo, an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society. \u201cOr they have people, maybe their adult children, questioning their decisions: \u2018Why are you dating again after Dad has died?\u2019\u201d Stand your ground, defend your right to a pleasure-filled life and know that it\u2019s worth the battle. Hoyton\u2019s top tip? Stay curious. \u201cIt\u2019s so fruitful,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can be curious about who you are in your relationship, and who your partner is, you\u2019re in the best possible place to work things out.\u201d",

        "body": "Walter Pfeiffer\u2019s hands have trembled ever since he was a little boy at primary school. The problem, recalls the Swiss photographer, only intensified as he aged. \u201cIt amuses me,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen people call me a genius for using flash from the very beginning. It gave me my style \u2013 but I only did it because a flash stabilised my images.\u201d Pfeiffer\u2019s photographs exude a perpetual summery warmth, as if all the harshness of life has been banished. Before gaining recognition in the art world, he spent years shooting for the underground gay zine scene. Remarkably, after achieving success, he refused to change his approach: it has always been just him and his subject, like a painter with a muse. These are mostly young men, often captured in moments of exuberance, leaping in the air or striking a pose at home or by the lake. Many shots hover between dream and reality, seeming to speak of first love. \u201cPeople I don\u2019t like leave me cold,\u201d says Pfeiffer. \u201cBut in the presence of real beauty, I go crazy \u2013 and I could work for 24 hours. Beauty is rare, not an everyday occurrence, and it\u2019s better that way. If there was too much beauty around we would grow bored with it.\u201d He laughs. As you flip through Chez Walti Photographs 2000-2022, his latest book, an epic volume spanning 400 pages, you soon grasp how much energy he puts into his craft. While photography still excites him as much as it did in the early days, taking pictures is becoming increasingly strenuous \u2013 partly because of his unsteady hands but also due to the difficulty of finding the right models. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not a drama queen,\u201d he says. \u201cI truly mean it. If I hadn\u2019t been an artist, my life would have been easier.\u201d Pfeiffer, although a seasoned photographer of 50 years, was unearthed by millennials, who became enamoured of his hyper-colourful shots in the early 2000s. According to Pfeiffer, they embraced him for the same reasons the art world had rejected him. His photographs seemed overly simple, almost amateur. The fashion industry, even more so, tends to value intricacy and depth. However, as social media boomed, Pfeiffer\u2019s work began to stand out. It was seen as innovative, ahead of its time. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to earn it all, step by step. I never thought I would make it this far. People consistently put me down, claiming I was just a \u2018naive\u2019 photographer. After a while, you end up believing it.\u201d A monumental Pfeiffer retrospective recently concluded at the Kunstmuseum in Lucerne, and his book signings at cities across Europe always draw huge queues of fervent young photography enthusiasts. Few artists have demonstrated such an enviable ability to foresee \u2013 and perhaps lead \u2013 taste. It\u2019s no coincidence, although it is certainly ironic, that Pfeiffer is now embraced by the fashion industry. \u201cIn the beginning,\u201d says the 77-year-old, \u201cart directors would approach me with mood boards, sketches and ideas. Oh God, I was so frightened! I\u2019d listen to them but eventually I\u2019d say, \u2018Listen, what\u2019s the point of doing something that others have already done?\u2019 I didn\u2019t have an agent at that time. I am a self-taught artist and, frankly, I didn\u2019t know how to handle that kind of stuff. I\u2019m not a professional. When I had to go to London for a fashion shoot, I was so financially strained that I could only afford a second-rate hotel and had to compress everything into a two-day window. Again, this is the story of my life.\u201d He remembers i-D magazine sending a sizeable box of exorbitantly priced clothes to his Zurich apartment for a photography session. Fearful of damaging the valuable garments in transit, Pfeiffer had them modelled in his living room. In fact, he has never had his own studio. Nor does he like to preconceive an image. His ideal approach involves meeting the subject then, much like on a blind date, embracing whatever vibe unfolds. \u201cQue sera sera,\u201d he says with a shrug. The results are generally on the lighthearted side, although there is nothing vague about them. Pfeiffer, born in the Swiss countryside \u201con the same day and year as Bruce Weber\u201d, originally trained as a painter. \u201cI would use Polaroids as aids,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThen, in the 1970s, I bought a small automatic camera.\u201d Around the same time, he relocated to the city. \u201cMy first models were beautiful Zurich street kids. The pursuit of real beauty is the goal of my life. Even today, the people I photograph evoke the Hollywood stars of the 1950s. But they don\u2019t have to be aware of that. I prefer non-professional models. I never had models \u2013 I had real people.\u201d The film stars he would see at the cinema felt like people he was growing up with. As models, he still regards them as unsurpassed. \u201cThere are a lot of mirrors and glasses in my pictures, a tribute to my enduring passion for Hollywood and for Cecil Beaton, with his magnificent photographs featuring mirrors. It\u2019s about unattainable perfection. I never quite reach it, so I simplify it. I\u2019ve had several Cecil Beaton moments.\u201d Pfeiffer realised he was gay at the age of 16. \u201cI was the naive country boy. One day I met a man who was gay, but I didn\u2019t even know what that meant. He introduced me to [gay magazine] Der Kreis.\u201d During that time Pfeiffer also fell for the homoerotic photographs of Karlheinz Weinberger and the highly masculinised drawings of Tom of Finland. \u201cI was captivated by all that beauty and couldn\u2019t comprehend what was happening inside me. Those were different times. You couldn\u2019t just say, \u2018I\u2019m 16 and I\u2019m gay.\u2019 Now, it\u2019s like a seal has been broken.\u201d After photographing his friends in the 1970s, he decided to publish his first book, now a rare find fetching giddying prices online. \u201cIt was produced by a publisher so impoverished that we had to convert all my photos to black and white to reduce the printing costs. It\u2019s still a good book, though. It doesn\u2019t age. You must be very careful when publishing a book: some get old while others remain timeless. I have so many books that already look dated even though they were published just three years ago.\u201d From then on, he says, his life became a constant and often exhausting pursuit of beauty. \u201cIt\u2019s my obsession,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes me click click click. I\u2019m obsessed with all those people who take me to new ground, new ideas. When people are boring \u2013 mamma mia! \u2013 it\u2019s terrible. Too much work. But when the right thing comes along, I feel alive again, although I\u2019m getting slower with age.\u201d We are in the caf\u00e9 of the Swiss National Museum in Zurich. Pfeiffer, drinking tea, reveals that he has been working on an archive for some time. It\u2019s not thousands of images, as one might assume. \u201cI used to shoot analogue,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t always have the money to buy film and develop photos. So in the early days, during fashion shoots, I would be like, \u2018Click, click, click \u2013 OK, we have it!\u2019 But only because it was all too expensive for me.\u201d In addition to mirrors, another thread running through Pfeiffer\u2019s work is flowers. They often adorn the hair or faces of his models, reminiscent of the images of Baron von Gloeden, known for his nude shots of young Sicilian men. However, unlike the German baron, Pfeiffer uses kitsch and camp in an ironic manner. His models wear flashy chandeliers instead of hats, while a garish piece of cloth might be wound into a turban. \u201cI think a good photograph needs no explanation,\u201d he says. \u201cOne should not even think, but just be amazed.\u201d Despite having photographed for the likes of Vogue and Vanity Fair, shooting everyone from Tom Ford to Tilda Swinton, the undercurrent of first love is something Pfeiffer is constantly, almost desperately, trying to convey. \u201cOf course I feel love for my models,\u201d he says. \u201cLove is necessary for my work. But I must maintain a certain distance.

        "body": "The frustrating thing about this swashbuckling multiplayer game from Ubisoft, which has reportedly been in development hell for about a decade, is that it\u2019s almost good. Some things about it are good, such as the ship battles, which are intriguingly customisable, more flexible than you\u2019d expect, even thrilling when you\u2019re up against a well-matched opponent. And when you\u2019re sailing from the African coast to the East Indies, or through river channels with tropical wilderness on all sides, you cannot help but admire how beautiful this game can be. And some things about it may become good; right now, the menus are confusing, and it\u2019s slow and turgid for hours before your piratical expeditions become more exciting, but a few tweaks could really pick up the pace. This is a live-service game, so it has room to evolve. But some things about Skull and Bones will never be good, at least not without tearing them down and starting again, which after years of expensive delays seems unlikely to happen. All of the characters in this game have dead eyes, and only their lips move when they speak to you. The story is so boring that after more than 20 hours on the seas, I can tell you the relative worth of uncut gems and where to sell your tobacco for the best price, but not the name of a single character or faction. And when you are on land, there\u2019s nothing to do \u2013 no sword fighting, no treasure-hunting, no meaningful exploration. Immense effort has been expended on creating small oases of land, and then nothing ever exists there except a couple of quest-givers and a bonfire. Only two more populous pirate-hub settlements exist on the whole map, where you can at least find a blacksmith or a tavern, but finding other interesting places to dock is a bust. This means that you\u2019ll spend 90% of your time sailing, because all the action is on the waves. And when you\u2019re not trying to ransack a merchant ship or defending yourself from other pirates, all that sailing involves is hoisting or lowering your sails, and occasionally adjusting your trajectory. It\u2019s boring, but I actually found it peaceful ferrying things around and enjoying the scenery. The Indian Ocean is the best thing about Skull and Bones: I felt quiet awe in occasional moments, such as when I was steering my svelte cutter through a tight pass, rocks rearing up on all sidesas I rounded a corner to see a waterfall tumbling from above as the sun was setting, soundtracked by my crew\u2019s shanties. In that moment, like Ubisoft\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed games sometimes do, Skull and Bones felt like a recreation of a lost time, breathing new life into the golden age of piracy. Unfortunately, Assassin\u2019s Creed is the elephant (seal) in the room here. Skull and Bones was inspired by 2013\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed: Black Flag, a hugely enjoyable pirate-flavoured adventure that really felt like an adventure, with islands to explore and things to discover and a plethora of interesting stories to find alongside the thrill of sailing and firing cannonballs at foes. 2018\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, too, features splendid seafaring on the azure ancient Grecian waters, and plenty else to do besides. Skull and Bones elevates the sailing ever so slightly, and has much better ship crafting \u2013 changing your seacraft and your weapons about really does alter how you play \u2013 but it has nothing else to offer, none of the personality or intrigue of the games that inspired it. The other game that can\u2019t escape mention here is Rare\u2019s Sea of Thieves, another online pirate action game that launched in a barren state in 2018 but has since evolved into a terrific time with friends, as funny and chaotic and characterful as you could hope a pirate game to be. But Skull and Bones is much more serious and solitary, a different game entirely \u2013 it reminded me much more of Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates than Sea of Thieves, in that most of the game is really about transporting cargo around and meddling with coloniser factions. The further in you get, the more Skull and Bones becomes about making, selling and transporting hidden-market goods, or sinking other players to steal theirs. It\u2019s a trade and naval battle simulator, really, more than a pirate game. It has no swagger, but it does have good seafaring and an excellent selection of tricorn hats. If its publisher Ubisoft continues to support it, Skull and Bones will attract a committed player base of sea-combat enthusiasts who enjoy tinkering with their ships\u2019 builds and facing off against each other, or teaming up to take on the intimidating fleets, cargo heists and sea monsters that lurk tens of hours in. If you are after a game that feels like a pirate adventure, though, you\u2019re still better off with Black Flag. Skull and Bones is out now; \u00a349.99",

        "body": "There isn\u2019t much that feels particularly feral or monstrous about this new musical, which is a bit of a strange beast. While often bold and brimming with smart theatrical ideas, it\u2019s a little uncertain of what it wants to be \u2013 just like the hormonal adolescents at its centre. Teenager Jax (\u201cshe/they/whatever\u201d) lives with her doting and supportive nan in a small Welsh village, passing the days with friends in the park and failing to get a job at the local chippy. That is until one day Ffion appears at the bus stop, armed with queer theory and poetry and terminology. Sparks fly, kisses are exchanged and climaxes reached as Jax navigates the turbulence of rural adolescence. Written by Bethan Marlow, with music by Nicola T Chang, Izzy Rabey\u2019s production moves at a brisk pace, possessing an impressive athletic dynamism, aided by musical director Alex Comana performing live on stage, Osian Meilir\u2019s muscular choreography and Cara Evans\u2019s design of ladders and climbing frames. Marty Langthorne\u2019s lighting is exquisite, as if the stage is a pulsating heart, fit to burst. As Jax, Rebecca Hayes carries proceedings with a sharp focus and Carys Eleri\u2019s funny and moving performance as Nan is especially lovely. The entire ensemble are more than up to the task, doubling as relatives and friends as well as giving voice to Jax\u2019s inner conflicting voices (echoing the conceit of the Thoughts in another queer musical, A Strange Loop). The 75 minutes whiz by with little pause but everything happens so quickly that there\u2019s little dramatic build-up and little to resolve. Catastrophes are swiftly overcome, forgiveness quickly granted to fairly unforgivable transgressions and an agitprop detour feels unearned. Perhaps this is dramatic structure as hormonal flux, and while it\u2019s refreshing to have a musical that centres queerness without making either gender or sexuality the source of dramatic tension, it causes the narrative to feel inconsequential. From the outset, it seems that Jax is content to work things out at their own pace. A bit more time might have been useful for the drama, too. At Sherman theatre, Cardiff, until 24 February. Then touring until 22 March",

        "body": "The public service must do more to eliminate conflicts of interest and ensure personal relationships in the workforce are not leading to power imbalances, the sector\u2019s chief has told senior bureaucrats. The Australian Public Service commissioner, Gordon de Brouwer, outlined his concerns in a letter to the leaders of all government departments and sought their assistance to identify, disclose and manage all conflicts. The letter was not prompted by one specific incident but reflects intense scrutiny on the public service\u2019s conduct after a number of scandals including the provision of government grants and outsourcing to consultancy firms. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThere is a need to strengthen our approach to the declaration and management of conflicts of interest by senior leaders,\u201d said De Brouwer\u2019s letter, sent in December. The commissioner, who is responsible for ensuring the public service meets its ethical and integrity standards, highlighted the letter in a submission to an ongoing parliamentary inquiry into the ethics and accountability of the consulting industry. Sections of the letter seen by Guardian Australia reveal the commissioner asked secretaries to \u201censure you and your senior executive service employees have up-to-date declarations in place, as well as strategies in your agency to mitigate or manage conflicts that are identified\u201d. \u201cI ask, too, that you ensure similar arrangements are in place for all relevant agency functions and processes, such that conflict of interest declarations are triggered for those participating in activities such as recruitment, procurement, awarding grants, or performing regulatory roles,\u201d De Brouwer said. He told senior executives that \u201cconflicts of interest can also arise from personal relationships, including relationships with colleagues\u201d. It is not known what incident, if any, prompted the commissioner to issue the warning. \u201cIt is essential that these relationships be declared and properly managed in order to mitigate any real or apparent conflict with employees\u2019 official duties,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe risks associated with such relationships are heightened where there is a supervisory relationship or a power imbalance between the individuals. \u201cI ask that you ensure that you and your senior staff understand the obligations to take reasonable steps to avoid conflicts of interest and to declare and manage those conflicts that cannot be avoided.\u201d While the letter did not cite any specific examples, several department leaders have faced scrutiny for conflict of interest controversies in recent months. In March, a review by former senior public servant Ian Watt found taxpayers forked out $374m for contracts deemed to be poor value for money and have perceived conflicts of interest. Earlier this month, the secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, David Fredericks, criticised EY Oceania\u2019s conflict of interest disclosures. He signalled his team would be taking a tougher approach in future. As revealed by Guardian Australia, the firm was supporting the oil and gas industry\u2019s lobbying efforts while being paid by for independent advice on the government\u2019s signature climate policy and gas emissions. The firm has denied any conflict of interest, but did not inform the department of its separate engagements. Fredericks told a Senate estimates hearing it was also important for firms to address the \u201cperception\u201d of a conflict of interest and that \u201cit\u2019s very clear in this instance that EY fell short\u201d of that. \u201cIt is something \u2026 that we all need to keep a very sharp eye on going forward as well,\u201d he said. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission has also faced criticism after it revealed four consultancy firms disclosed more than 520 real, potential or perceived conflicts of interest while being paid more than $40m to audit the safety and quality of aged care homes over two years. The commission said no work was assigned to consultants who disclosed a conflict but many senators, unions and transparency watchdogs have questioned whether they should have been employed at all. In August, Guardian Australia revealed PwC Australia did not disclose any real or perceived conflicts of interest to the federal government before it was awarded a $2.3m aged care contract that has been suspended since June amid a continuing investigation.",

        "body": "The good news is real wages are finally going up \u2013 and not by so much that the Reserve Bank should be worried that it needs to once again raise interest rates. Last September there was a big 1.3% jump in wages. If you had just looked at that period in isolation, you would have thought the mythical wage breakout was about to occur and the RBA would be off to the races raising rates higher and higher. But in December overall wages grew by a much more moderate 0.95% and private-sector wages rose just 0.88%. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup If the graph does not display click here The reason wage growth in December was even that large was due to the biggest jump in public-sector wages since 2008. But even that 1.3% quarterly increase should not be all the surprising or concerning for the RBA, given over the past three years public-sector wages have lagged behind that of the private sector. After years of enduring arbitrary wage caps, public-sector workers are seeking some redress. But while there has been a jump, in a majority of states and territories, the wage growth in the public sector lags well behind \u2013 especially in South Australia and the ACT with its mostly commonwealth public servants: If the graph does not display click here While the annual growth of all wages continues to rise \u2013 now up to 4.2% \u2013 private-sector wage growth looks like it has peaked: If the graph does not display click here This accords with the most recent wage growth figures from the Fair Work Commission for enterprise agreements. After solid increases in the middle of last year, wage growth in agreements has stayed around 4.2% since October: If the graph does not display click here It all suggests that concern wages are about to drive inflation and thus interest rates higher rather overblown. Wages are actually growing quite sensibly and finally (finally!) they are growing faster than inflation. It is often forgotten amid all the talk about \u201cexcess demand\u201d and \u201cwage-price inflation\u201d that wages should grow faster than inflation. It\u2019s a key to improved living standards. And yet for the past few years that has not happened. However, in 2023 inflation rose 4.05% while the wage price index rose 4.2%. That means for the first time since March 2021 people\u2019s wages are higher in real terms now than they were a year ago. If the graph does not display click here While that is good news, it\u2019s such small growth that it\u2019s likely people\u2019s real after-tax wage did not go up. Similarly, while wages rose faster than total inflation, they rose by less than the prices of non-discretionary items. Because low- and middle-income earners spend more of their income on those essential items, it means they are also less likely to have seen an increase in their ability to buy more with their pay. As it stands, we have a very long way to recover our lost real wages. This recent increase only puts the level of real wages back to where they were in September 2011: If the graph does not display click here It also means that the average wage still buys about 5% less than it did in March 2020. While the RBA has continued to talk up the stock of household savings that is helping bolster spending (and thus demand), for those households who rely overwhelmingly on their wages, the past three years have been historically brutal. The good news is the recent stronger wage growth is pretty widespread. Last year the wage growth in around half of all industries was faster than inflation, but wage growth in all industries remain a long way behind the increase in prices since the start of the pandemic: If the graph does not display click here And while the news of wages rising faster than inflation will be welcome to workers, businesses and employers will be less impressed given the many efforts they undertake to keep wages down. One tactic they use involves forcing workers to sign \u201cnon-compete\u201d clauses that prevents workers from leaving one job and going to work for a competitor. This keeps wages down because it means people can\u2019t leave one place and go elsewhere for better pay. New data from the ABS shows that more than one in five businesses have such non-compete clauses, and the bigger the business the more likely it has such a contract in place. If the graph does not display click here While such contracts make sense for, say, CEOs of a grocery company, they make no sense for someone who just works in the store. And yet the ABS found that such restraints \u2013 including non-disclosure clauses \u2013 cover 68% of upper-level managers or executives, but applied to 75% of other employees. Such clauses mean big businesses don\u2019t need to worry about a competitor raising wages to poach their best workers. It\u2019s a good reminder that, just as recent inquiries have found, businesses don\u2019t like to compete to keep prices down, they also don\u2019t like competing with each other to send wages up.

North Korean state media said on Tuesday that Kim was \u201cpresented with a car made in Russia for his personal use by Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, president of the Russian Federation.\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later confirmed the gift, saying it was an Aurus, a full-sized luxury sedan of the type used by Putin. \u201cWhen the head of the DPRK [North Korea] was at the Vostochny cosmodrome, he looked at this car, Putin showed it to him personally, and like many people, Kim liked this car,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cSo this decision was made,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cNorth Korea is our neighbour, our close neighbour, and we intend, and will continue, to develop our relations with all neighbours, including North Korea.\u201d Asked about the gift, state department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Wednesday told reporters in Washington, \u201cI actually, frankly, didn\u2019t know there was such a thing as a Russian luxury car.\u201d \u201cI hope Kim got the extended warranty,\u201d he joked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I was buying a luxury car Russia would be the place I would look.\u201d Kim\u2019s powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong, said the \u201cgift serves as a clear demonstration of the special personal relations between the top leaders,\u201d according to the Korean Central News Agency. Russia and North Korea have been moving closer since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with Kim meeting Putin in Russia\u2019s far east in September. US and South Korean officials say that Russia, long a pre-eminent military power, has become so desperate to replenish its arsenal that it has turned to North Korean and Iranian imports. Echoing an earlier statement from South Korea, the United States said that the gift would go against a UN security council ban on sending luxury goods to North Korea, which has defiantly carried out years of nuclear and missile tests. \u201cIf this is true, it would appear to be once again Russia violating UN security council resolutions that it itself supported,\u201d Miller said. Russia\u2019s best-known car is the Lada, which became the butt of jokes in the West during the cold war due to its no-frills utilitarian design, with its ultra-low price drawing budget-conscious drivers outside the Soviet bloc.

        "body": "Keiran Goddard is a poet and novelist whose debut novel, Hourglass, was longlisted for the Desmond Elliott prize in 2022. His second novel, I See Buildings Fall Like Lightning, is a worthy successor. A multivocal narrative focusing on a working-class community in Birmingham, it follows Rian, Patrick, Shiv, Oli and Conor as they grow up and grow apart. Rian has left Birmingham and got rich, more or less by accident, playing the stock market on his laptop; the other four stayed behind. As Goddard observes in a striking opening sentence, \u201cAnd then none of it happened.\u201d Life came at them fast, and none of their dreams has come true. Patrick works as a takeaway delivery biker, and has two children with Shiv; Oli is a drug dealer too fond of his own supply; Conor has a chaotic home life, and a plan to make things better. At the beginning of the novel, these childhood friends get together for a night out, and Conor asks Rian if he can borrow money to embark on a construction project. By the end of the book, they\u2019ve gone through a tragedy that seems to have cut them off definitively from their past. There\u2019s a subtly radical treatment of narrative here. Rather than kinetic or dynamic storytelling, what Goddard offers as he switches between the voices of his five main characters is a series of tableaux and character studies; internal monologues presenting the latest state of affairs, while the plot goes on seemingly just behind the text, reported to but not exactly witnessed by the reader. At its best, the technique is reminiscent of Jon McGregor\u2019s most successful novels, If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things and Reservoir 13; voices and images succeed one another, accumulating into a composite portrait of people becoming unmoored from youth. It\u2019s not always entirely satisfying, as the technique dispenses with the pleasure of pure, live storytelling, one thing flowing into another. There\u2019s little vocal differentiation, and so without conventional dramatic scenarios in which the characters can extensively interact, the text sometimes becomes a monochrome reading experience. There is also a slight tension between the book\u2019s close focus on a small friendship group and its occasional gestures towards having something larger to say about Birmingham, or even England. Goddard\u2019s characters each feel isolated within their own lives, and remain isolated from the wider world when they get together; what the novel studies is a friendship group, not a wider community. Many great writers about work, from Robert Tressell to David Storey and right up to Boiling Point on the BBC last year, have sought to dramatise the hustle and bustle of a workplace; the building site at the heart of Goddard\u2019s novel is only really seen and overheard from a distance. However, these are caveats that do not obscure the success of a moving and highly successful character portrait. The cliche goes that second novels, like second albums, are tricky to navigate; having had the whole of their lives to get the first ones right, writers sign contracts giving them 18 months or two years in which to repeat the trick. It\u2019s a lazy reading of how artists develop. Whether they succeed or not, second novels are the moment when a new way of seeing the world, announced with the writer\u2019s debut, begins to develop and grow \u2013 the single book gives way to the multifaceted career, and the writer\u2019s direction of future travel begins to emerge. This novel left me eager to follow Goddard\u2019s work as he continues to develop. \u2022 I See Buildings Fall Like Lightning by Keiran Goddard is published by Abacus (\u00a316.99) in the UK and on 14 May in Australia.

        "body": "Inside the Million Dollar Theatre in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday night, comedians cracked jokes about wokeness, the \u201cscamdemic\u201d, Joe Biden\u2019s age and stumbles \u2013 and Robert F Kennedy Jr made his pitch, of sorts, to voters. The 70-year-old, a member of the Kennedy political dynasty, with a long history of promoting conspiracy theories and vaccine skepticism, is running for president as an independent. Recent polling from Quinnipiac projected that in a race involving Biden and Trump, Kennedy, who has pledged to \u201cend the forever wars, clean up government [and] increase wealth for all\u201d, could receive as much as 15% of the vote. Kennedy has been campaigning across the country for months, and on Wednesday he was on his home turf of Los Angeles, where his wife, Cheryl Hines, the Curb Your Enthusiasm star, hosted a fundraiser in the form of a comedy show. The event was open to anyone with $150 to spare and promised a \u201cNight of Laughter\u201d with standup from names such as Adam Carolla, Jeremy Piven and Rob Schneider \u2013 the one-time SNL star and now conservative influencer. Hundreds of people lined up around the theater, eager to hear from Kennedy and excited about the possibility of a third-party candidate. \u201cThis makes me think think he has a chance,\u201d Burke Smith said as he pointed to the line. Smith, who drove up from San Diego, said he likes Donald Trump but would prefer Kennedy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck in the two-party system for so long. He represents the embodiment of what the middle of the road is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe speaks to the majority of the people.\u201d Kennedy has polled higher than expected and drawn support from both Democrats and Republicans, though a review by FiveThirtyEight of eight polls on his popularity found that he was better liked among Republicans, which some experts believe is due to his promotion of conspiracy theories and role as an anti-vaccine activist. Kennedy, the son of the US attorney general and presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy, and the nephew of John F Kennedy, has been in the public eye for decades, and previously drew attention for his work as a bestselling author and environmental lawyer. But in recent years he has become a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement, and started a non-profit that has promoted misinformation about vaccines and Covid public-health measures. Public health experts have described his work as misleading and harmful, as have family members. His family has also expressed their opposition to his presidential campaign, with his siblings describing his decision to run as \u201cdangerous to our country\u201d. Last year, he made comments linking antidepressants to school shootings; claimed that chemicals in water are causing more kids to identify as transgender; and promoted a conspiracy theory that Covid was \u201ctargeted\u201d to Black and white people while Chinese and Jewish people were \u201cmost immune\u201d. Those in attendance at Wednesday\u2019s event wanted to hear from Kennedy first-hand. For his part, Smith said he liked that Kennedy had done his own research on vaccines, unlike Trump or Biden. Still, he described himself as on the fence about how he would vote, but said he was hopeful that, with enough support, Kennedy could provide the change he believes the country badly needs. Aside from brief remarks from Kennedy at the end of the evening and pleas from Hines to vote and to help him get on the ballot, the evening was entirely focused on comedy \u2013 often with plenty of culture-war zingers. The crowd was younger than expected and included no shortage of designer shoes and $2,000 handbags. The front row featured familiar faces such as Dr Drew Pinsky and Drea de Matteo, both ardent supporters of Kennedy. Some comedians did not touch on politics at all, but jokes about Biden falling or the pandemic being \u201cdesigned\u201d drew rapturous applause, as did a line about Larry David\u2019s support for Barack Obama. The creator of Curb Your Enthusiasm told the New York Times last year that he is not backing Kennedy\u2019s candidacy. Mentions of California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, unsurprisingly also elicited boos. The jokes included plenty of complaints about woke culture, reverse racism and a bit from Schneider comparing Mexican people to pests. Schneider, once known for his roles in Adam Sandler movies, has embraced conservative causes in recent years. Schneider praised Kennedy for his \u201csacrifice\u201d in trying to contribute to his country. The millionaire also got in digs at unhoused people in California as well as crime in the Golden State and complaints about the Democratic party. Kennedy spoke for just a moment, thanking the crowd for their passion and intensity before heading off to an after-party (tickets to that event cost $1,000) where he was set to make a speech. After the show, some guests praised the lineup, but said they didn\u2019t know more about Kennedy than when they arrived. \u201cI was hoping to learn more about him,\u201d Alec Borofv said.",

        "body": "Planning a wedding can amplify life\u2019s big struggles: money, body image, friendships, family ties and fractures. You rank the people in your life, draw a ring around those you\u2019d like to attend and a smaller inner circle for the bridal party, then decide what everyone will wear and who sits with who. It\u2019s ripe for drama and discord. I got engaged in July 2022 after eight years with my partner. Months after the proposal, we finally planned an engagement party and started dipping our toes into the wider world of weddings. I had been to weddings but never really imagined organising one, so I couldn\u2019t believe how many options there were \u2013 or how much everything cost. One evening my fiance had a proposal of a different kind: what if we turned our upcoming engagement party into a surprise wedding? It was six weeks away. Within a couple of days we\u2019d booked a celebrant, photographer and food truck. In those busy first few days, I joined a Facebook group of almost 80,000 people looking for or giving wedding advice. I had so many questions: how did people prioritise their spending? Which traditions did they adapt or skip? Were there other examples of low-key weddings in a park? I read almost every post that reached my feed, trawled the comments sections and searched the group\u2019s archive. When my wedding day was over, I no longer needed the group. I\u2019d never posted or commented and I didn\u2019t plan on starting now I\u2019d \u201cgraduated\u201d (their parlance for those who\u2019ve pulled off the event). But I stayed anyway, because I am nosy and I love the community. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning One woman writes that she is struggling to fill the seats at her wedding. She wants more friends in attendance, real or pretend. The comments section floods: people offer to throw her a hen weekend and to travel from interstate for the big day. Those who live close suggest catching up for a coffee with the goal of striking up a real friendship. And one commenter admits that looking at her own wedding photographs now makes her sad because of how few friends she has. Every day in this group, people \u2013 mostly women \u2013 across Australia ask and answer big questions like that among themselves. Posts span from silly and surface-level to vulnerable and heartbreaking. A 21-year-old about to marry the father of her children asks whether her hesitations constitute cold feet or something bigger. Another woman in another post shares that she and her fiance have decided not to get married and wonders whether the relationship can be resuscitated once the pressure of a wedding is removed. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The responses to both posts are gentle and generous; some suggest counselling, others ways to reconnect. A few share words of warning about the weddings they went through with, against their gut feelings, urging these women not to do the same. I have seen threads with women offering up their preloved dresses to brides who\u2019ve realised theirs isn\u2019t right; asking for advice upon finding out they\u2019re pregnant; wondering how to navigate hurt feelings around elopements; honour a loved one who has died or respond when someone receives a challenging health diagnosis. There are many questions about money, from how to pay (\u201cSavings? Loan? Credit card?\u201d) to shaving down the cost. Renee Apap, married last June, joined the group for just that reason: \u201cTo help keep costs down, and work out where and if I was getting ripped off.\u201d She is still a member now. Kerry Graham told me she used the group to find \u201csupport with body positivity\u201d, including suggestions for dresses and beauty services \u201cwithout judgment\u201d. Now married, she has remained in the group \u201cas I love seeing people\u2019s weddings come together\u201d and enjoys suggesting budget-friendly ideas. \u201cI feel good to know you can help someone save costs, even if a little.\u201d Jessica Barker originally came for the savings, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve been broke since planning the wedding, so being able to save here and there was a true blessing.\u201d But more than that, Barker was looking for a community, because \u201cmy mum has passed away, and \u2026 [I] didn\u2019t really have the best idea how to plan myself.\u201d One bride posts wedding photos to the group after going ahead with her elopement just days after a miscarriage. At the time of writing, the post has 938 likes and dozens of comments expressing well wishes and condolences. One woman in the comments thread shares a similar story of her own, saying she understands the way a wedding after a period of loss acts as a light at the end of the tunnel. There is tenderness and connection here. I\u2019m not alone in feeling it or in sticking around. This is the power that safe digital spaces can hold. For me this wedding-related Facebook group offers a daily dose of generosity and humanity; for others it could be a Discord server, Reddit thread, a fan account or a high school group chat. We might not contribute to their rhythms, but it can be enough just to exist in these online villages, to wander their streets and pause to eavesdrop. Even if they\u2019re no longer useful, we\u2019re drawn back by our curiosity, nostalgia or plain old nosiness. When time spent online can so often make us feel worse about ourselves and the world, it makes a big difference to feel at home somewhere. Or as Bronwyn Pearce, married in October, still a member of the wedding group, puts it: \u201cAmongst all the \u2026 nonsense we see on socials, it\u2019s nice to scroll through photos of people\u2019s happiest moments.\u201d",

        "body": "GCSE grades have an excellent track record in predicting the future lives and careers of young adults, according to researchers, who found the exams were even more crucial for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Academics from Leeds and York universities found that the predictive power of GCSE results outstripped those of gender or later qualifications, including university degrees, in charting the development of young people from the age of 16 into their early 20s. \u201cWhat we can definitely say is that GCSEs have a considerable impact on how your life develops into your early 20s, and that the benefits from GCSEs are over and above the education someone obtains later,\u201d said Alexandra Starr, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of York and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cThe main message I would say is that GCSE grades are important in real life. We always talk about whether exams are only important within the education system, to climb the next rung in the educational ladder. But it\u2019s also important beyond that.\u201d The research, published on Thursday in the journal Developmental Psychology, comes as nearly 800,000 students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland prepare to sit their GCSE exams this spring. The researchers interviewed 6,500 people aged 23, recording their GCSE grades and later qualifications such as A-levels and degrees, along with their current occupation, income and questions on their financial and emotional wellbeing, as well as other measures including family background. While those with strong GCSE results also did well in terms of university entry and prestigious occupations, the results were particularly marked for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cIt\u2019s important to encourage children to perform well in school because it\u2019s important for their overall future. And it\u2019s important to acknowledge this is especially true for children from less privileged backgrounds,\u201d said Starr. \u201cFor them it is more important to obtain good grades at GCSE level, to then have further educational opportunities such as going to university and being admitted into the courses they want to study, compared to their more privileged peers, who might have more of a support system they can rely on.\u201d Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cEducation can be the great social leveller for children from under-resourced backgrounds \u2013 the huge challenge we face in the post-pandemic era is that too few are securing the basic GCSE grades needed to function and flourish in later life. \u201cOur country would be a fairer and more productive place if we targeted more education resources to those pupils who have been held back by the rising levels of inequality we are now experiencing.\u201d The Sutton Trust, which campaigns for social mobility through education, warned that there is a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d being created by the widening attainment gap between rich and poor pupils in England. The trust is calling for the next government to create a long-term national strategy to close the gap, including rebalancing funding back towards schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.",

        "body": "Seeing the same GP improves patients\u2019 health, reduces doctors\u2019 workloads and could free up millions of appointments, according to the largest study of its kind. Primary care is under enormous strain, with patients struggling to book consultations, GPs quitting or retiring early, and financial pressures causing some practices to close. Four-week waits hit a record high in 2023, with 17.6m appointments taking place at least 28 days after being booked in England last year. Research has previously suggested there may be benefits to seeing the same family doctor. But studies have mostly been small or covered a short period of time. Now University of Cambridge and Insead business school researchers have analysed data from 10m consultations over more than a decade in the most authoritative study on the issue yet. They found that if all GP practices moved to a model where patients saw the same doctor at each visit, it would significantly reduce doctors\u2019 workloads while improving patient health. Multiple benefits emerged when patients had a long-term relationship with their doctor, researchers found. Seeing the same GP \u2013 known as continuity of care \u2013 meant people waited on average 18% longer between visits, compared with patients who saw different doctors. People did not take up more GP time in each consultation and the findings were particularly strong for older patients, those with multiple chronic illnesses, and people with mental health conditions. Although it will not always be possible for people to see their regular GP, researchers said the findings would translate to an estimated 5% reduction in consultations if all practices provided the level of continuity of care of the best 10% of practices. That suggests millions of appointments could be freed up. The researchers added: \u201cImportantly, if patients receiving care from their regular doctors have longer intervals between consultations without requiring longer consultations, then continuity of care can potentially allow physicians to expand their patient list without increasing their time commitment.\u201d In the study published in the journal Management Science, experts analysed 10m consultations across 381 practices in England over 11 years. The study said: \u201cA physician can be considered more productive if they improve the quality of care provided without reducing the number of patients they serve per year or if they serve more patients without reducing quality of care. \u201cIn primary care, where patients often have a preferred doctor, these two dimensions are related. \u201cIf physicians provide high-quality care to their regular patients, they are likely to keep them healthier, which reduces the demand for consultations and increases their capacity to serve more patients.\u201d Analysis of England\u2019s GP patient survey data by the Nuffield Trust showed that when asked \u201chow often do you see or speak to your preferred GP when you would like to?\u201d, continuity of care has declined over time. Between 2018 and 2023, the proportion of patients who \u201calways or almost always\u201d saw or spoke to their preferred GP decreased from 26% to 16% while those who answered \u201cnever or almost never\u201d increased from 10% to 19%. A co-author of the study, Prof Stefan Scholtes, from Cambridge Judge Business School, said seeing the same doctor could have enormous benefits. \u201cThe impact is substantial: it could be the equivalent of increasing the GP workforce by 5%, which would significantly benefit both patients and the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter health translates into less demand for future consultations. Prioritising continuity of care is crucial in enhancing productivity.\u201d The UK has a major shortfall of GPs, according to the Health Foundation and the Nuffield Trust, with thousands more medics needed to meet demand. In the US, the Association of American Medical Colleges estimates a shortfall of up to 55,200 primary care physicians by 2033. \u201cGetting it right the first time\u201d would reduce GPs\u2019 future workloads by \u201cpreventing revisits\u201d, Prof Scholtes added. In the study, researchers used anonymised data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, consisting of more than 10m GP visits between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2017. The study restricted itself to patients who had at least three consultations over the previous two years. Dr Harshita Kajaria-Montag, lead author of the new study, who is now based at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University in the US, said: \u201cThe benefits of continuity of care are obvious from a relationship point of view. \u201cIf you\u2019re a patient with complex health needs, you don\u2019t want to have to explain your whole health history at every appointment. If you have a regular doctor who\u2019s familiar with your history, it\u2019s a far more efficient use of time, for doctor and patient.\u201d Dr Victoria Tzortziou-Brown, vice-chair of the Royal College of GPs, said continuity of care was \u201chighly valued by GPs and patients alike\u201d, adding: \u201cStudies such as this one are very important for informing future policy and practice. \u201cCurrently, the intense workload and workforce pressures GPs are facing \u2013 as well as political agendas prioritising speedy access to GP services above all else \u2013 greatly limit the level of continuity we can offer.\u201d",

He\u2019d got us the best table, by the window. What did you talk about? Our pasts, our fathers\u2019 service in the war, the Labour party, our children, biking, sea swimming (which we both love, but I suspect he\u2019s more of a Lycra sporty person than me). Some techy stuff \u2013 he\u2019s far more involved in that than I am, being a mathematician/physicist, while I\u2019m deeply technophobic. And he asked masses about me, which was pretty unusual and very nice. Most awkward moment? None, as far as I\u2019m aware. We were both frank about our past forays into internet dating, which was rather companionable. Good table manners? Yes. And we shared the food, and indeed took photos of it, as we both have a foodie child. Best thing about Mike? Likable and easy to talk to. Would you introduce Mike to your friends? Yes, unless they had a dog \u2013 Mike doesn\u2019t like them, which is a bit of a deal-breaker. Describe Mike in three words. Well-mannered, chatty, curious. What do you think Mike made of you? God knows. Did you go on somewhere? No. I think we realised it was not to be, but gracefully exchanged phone numbers. I think it was a slight relief when I said: \u201cHere\u2019s the killer: I not only love dogs, but I like them sleeping on my bed.\u201d (I didn\u2019t add \u201cIn my bed\u201d, which is also true.) And \u2026 did you kiss? Cordial pecks on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the date, what would it be? Nothing really, it was fine. Marks out of 10? 8. Would you meet again? Probably not. Mike on Deborah What were you hoping for? Nothing beyond a couple of hours of intelligent and amusing conversation. Deborah certainly delivered on both counts. First impressions? An attractive, lively and engaging woman. What did you talk about? We ranged across her writing career, my work, politics, relationships, our families, pastimes \u2013 and dogs. Most awkward moment? I don\u2019t recall any: we quickly settled into a relaxed and friendly conversation. Good table manners? Impeccable. We shared some of our dishes. Amusingly, neither of us touched so much as a single drop of alcohol. I hardly ever touch the stuff. It didn\u2019t inhibit a great conversation, though. Best thing about Deborah? Although she has had an illustrious writing career, I had no sense that she was condescending towards someone as ordinary as myself. It felt like a conversation between equals. Would you introduce Deborah to your friends? I would be very happy to; I think she would fit in very well, particularly with my literary friends. Describe Deborah in three words. Listener, informed, intelligent. What do you think Deborah made of you? Whatever she made of me, she was gracious enough to show what appeared to be a genuine interest in my life and careers. Did you go on somewhere? No. I believe Deborah said she had to get back for something else. And \u2026 did you kiss? We exchanged goodbye pecks on the cheeks, as you do with friends. If you could change one thing about the date, what would it be? It would\u2019ve been great to have had more time to get to know Deborah better. Marks out of 10? 9. Would you meet again? Yes.

According to Deadline, Cruise has signed on to star in the film, about which little is known other than that it will be in English and has been written by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu along with Sabina Berman, as well as Birdman co-writers Alexander Dinelaris and Nicolas Giacobone. The film is due to be produced by Warner Bros under Cruise\u2019s recently announced non-exclusive contract with the studio, which allows for Cruise to work on projects for other Hollywood entities. A third Top Gun film is in the works at Paramount, and Cruise is believed to currently be filming Mission Impossible \u2013 Dead Reckoning Part Two, production of which was delayed by Covid, and which is due for release in May 2025. Cruise is also working \u201cdiligently\u201d on a long-gestating project that involves shooting in space. Alongside his success in action movies, Cruise has a strong record in more dramatic and comedic films. In 1994 he starred alongside Brad Pitt in Interview with the Vampire, and followed it up with the lead role in Jerry Maguire, for which he was Oscar nominated. In 1999, he appeared in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s final film Eyes Wide Shut, and subsequently received a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his role in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s Magnolia. In 2005 he starred opposite Jamie Foxx in Collateral, and played a movie producer in the 2008 comedy Tropic Thunder. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the first Mexican to be nominated for the best director Oscar, released Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths in 2022, and last made an English-language film in 2015 with The Revenant, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. His films have won eight Academy awards, including three for The Revenant (including best director) and a special achievement Academy Award for the virtual-reality short film Flesh and Sand.",

        "body": "Kelsey has been a Taylor Swift fan since childhood. Last week in Melbourne was the 27-year-old\u2019s first time seeing the singer play live. It was a huge moment. But now that it\u2019s over Kelsey is \u201cjust plain sad\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been in post-Taylor Swift depression,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to manage it \u2026 But my mind wanders back to the concert. And it just makes you feel a bit sad, because it\u2019s like a dream that you don\u2019t want to wake up from.\u201d Kelsey isn\u2019t alone in experiencing a harsh comedown after the Melbourne leg of the Eras tour. On TikTok, fans are posting videos of themselves crying in the car on the way to work, \u201cnow permanently unfit to function normally\u201d, or asking followers what they\u2019re meant to do with their life now that Eras is over. On the social media platform X, others have said that after watching Swift perform, they\u2019re scared they\u2019ll \u201cnever feel the same happiness again\u201d. Melbourne Swiftie Rachel Turner says the blood, sweat, tears and money that went into attending the event makes the crash feel harder. \u201cHalf the country was in line for those tickets, and I spent hours and hours across so many different devices to be able to get the chance to go,\u201d she says. \u201cSince then I\u2019ve been in preparation mode for Eras. I\u2019ve been watching the TikToks, I\u2019ve been planning the outfits, I\u2019ve been strategising what era everyone should dress as for like three months. \u201cSo much effort, planning and anticipation really built up into one night, so I\u2019m definitely feeling like I\u2019ve closed the chapter.\u201d It \u201cabsolutely is\u201d normal to feel a little deflated after an anticipated event like the Eras tour, says Kayla Greenstien, a former counsellor and psychology PhD candidate who was on the steering committee of last week\u2019s Swiftposium, an academic conference devoted to assessing the musician\u2019s widespread impact. \u201cI think we see a similar thing with weddings,\u201d Greenstien says. \u201cFor people attending the Taylor Swift concert, the atmosphere created there is such a space of femininity \u2026 to step out of that concert space and go back into the real world, it\u2019s kind of like the Barbie movie effect \u2013 it can absolutely be jarring. So I think people really need to look out for themselves at this time.\u201d Greenstien, who doesn\u2019t identify as a full-blown Swiftie but is certainly \u201cSwift-curious\u201d, researches psychedelic therapy. She sees parallels between taking psychedelics and attending the Eras tour. Both have \u201ca lot of preparation and lead-up, and the experience is almost transcendental\u201d, she says. \u201cThe sense of connectedness that you have with others is extremely sparkly in the same way \u2026 someone might experience at a Taylor Swift concert.\u201d So what can be done when a lavender haze fades to blue like you\u2019ve never known? \u201cIn psychedelic therapy, we talk about integration, which is how you make sense of that profound experience you just had,\u201d Greenstien says. \u201cIt\u2019s worth reflecting on what was really so wonderful about that experience, because I think it goes beyond just seeing Taylor Swift \u2013 it\u2019s the atmosphere, the connectedness, the dressing up, going with family, going with friends.\u201d Greenstien says it\u2019s worth asking what positive things about the experience can be brought back into everyday life. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning To commemorate the event, she also suggests \u201cdoing something nice\u201d with photos and memorabilia from the show, such as printing pictures out and putting them in a scrapbook. Some Swifties have other suggestions. Blessed by the ticketing gods, \u201cproud Swiftie\u201d Lorrae McKenna went to two Eras shows in Melbourne. To ease the re-entry, McKenna and some friends she attended with plan to hold a screening of the Eras concert movie \u201cto help us process everything\u201d. Her comedown has been manageable, she says, except for the number of Swift tracks she has been playing. \u201cMy partner is like, \u2018You have a problem. And you need to stop listening now.\u2019\u201d McKenna says giving her friendship bracelets from the night to her children has helped too, because she enjoys seeing the thrill they get out of them. Turner has also taken solace in friendship bracelets. She is still wearing hers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just an ironic gimmicky thing. I think that they\u2019re actually quite sweet and it\u2019s a memory that I\u2019ll cherish.\u201d She went to Eras with her older sister Jess, and spent the whole show \u201cscreaming, crying, singing and holding Jess\u2019 hand\u201d. Her elder sibling hasn\u2019t been in the same post-Eras funk, though \u2013 she\u2019s actually been riding a high ever since the confetti dropped. \u201c[Taylor Swift] just puts an ethos out into the world that if you lift other women up, and live your life leading with kindness, that you are the best or most powerful version of yourself,\u201d Jess says. \u201cI think that\u2019s really at the heart of it. When you go and are surrounded by 96,000 people that all buy into that, you can\u2019t help but walk out of that, just being like \u2026 \u2018People are awesome.\u2019 And you just are reminded to be a bit better every day.\u201d Jess doesn\u2019t want Swifties to be deterred by the party-pooping \u201cSwift grinches\u201d out there. She says those going to shows in Sydney should celebrate the night by posting their photos on social media. \u201cBask in it \u2013 just be like, \u2018That made me happy and I had a really fun time.\u2019 Don\u2019t hold back, just put it out in the world.\u201d For Kelsey, watching the videos she filmed on repeat at Eras has certainly helped with the comedown. Her advice to Sydney Swifties is to do the same: \u201cIt can ease your mind to just say: \u2018Oh I went there. I was part of history. We did it.\u2019\u201d",

        "body": "My earliest reading memory My strongest early memories are of my mother reading to me, before I\u2019d learned to read myself. I\u2019d follow her around, begging her to stop doing her housework and read to me. When she did, it was usually from Grimms\u2019 fairytales, which we both loved. But she never read long enough to satisfy me; I always wanted her to go on. I didn\u2019t understand how housework could have been more important. (I still don\u2019t.) My favourite book growing up My early love of fairytales endured and I developed an equal love of myths. I had a paperback edition of Edith Hamilton\u2019s Mythology with illustrations by the startlingly named Steele Savage that was so well thumbed it ended up needing to be held together with rubber bands. As a lover of horses, I also became a devoted fan of the Black Stallion books by Walter Farley. The book that changed me as a teenager I remember a long night in the bathroom reading Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina while everyone else in the apartment slept. I remember thinking that I would rather read than sleep \u2013 that I\u2019d rather read than do anything \u2013 and how this set me apart from everyone I knew at the time. I knew how great the book in my hands was, and I understood, for what may have been the first time, how important to my life great books were going to be. The book that made me want to be a writer As a child I believed that I would write children\u2019s books, because those were the stories that made me want to invent stories of my own. I wanted to write about witches and little people and magical beasts and talking animals. When I was growing up I wanted to be Dr Seuss. The author I came back to In college I read some stories by John Cheever, and for reasons I\u2019ve never been able to fathom I did not think much of them. Luckily, about a decade later, when a collection of his stories was published to much acclaim, I tried again and became an ardent fan. Now I\u2019ve reread many of those 61 stories several times, and my love for this superb writer remains undiminished. The book I reread I often find myself wanting to read Proust again. Another book I keep returning to is Rilke\u2019s The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge. Jamaica Kincaid\u2019s poignant coming-of-age novel, Lucy, is a book I\u2019ve taught in various literature courses quite often over the years, and no matter how well I know it, rereading never fails to be a fresh and rewarding experience. The book I could never read again An exasperated English professor once barked at our class, \u201cOne of these damn days you\u2019re going to have to read the damn Bible.\u201d And so I did, cover to cover (King James Version). I don\u2019t remember how long it took, but even given another lifetime I can\u2019t imagine doing that again. The book I discovered later in life I came late to Christopher Isherwood, finally reading his Berlin Stories when I was around 60. I was so impressed that I immediately moved on to Prater Violet and A Single Man, and Isherwood became an influence on my own writing. The book I am currently reading Some years ago I read Walter Kempowski\u2019s final novel, All for Nothing, translated from the German by Anthea Bell. Set during the last days of the Third Reich, it\u2019s one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. Now I\u2019ve just begun his first novel, An Ordinary Youth, translated by Michael Lipkin. Originally published in 1971, it\u2019s an autobiographical novel based on Kempowski\u2019s boyhood in Nazi Germany. My comfort read I don\u2019t have what I\u2019d specifically call a comfort read. I\u2019d say any reading that engages my attention and gives me pleasure is a comfort to me. \u2022 The Vulnerables by Sigrid Nunez is published by Virago (\u00a316.99).

        "body": "Earlier this week, moderators at Perth writers\u2019 weekend were issued a memo with an ominous subject heading: \u201cFacilitator safety tips\u201d. \u201cSome of you will be aware of discussions around Perth Festival Writers\u2019 Weekend and may have some concerns about the potential for disruption at the event,\u201d the email began. \u201cAs the facilitators, we want to give you agency over your panels and the ability to manage them \u2026 these tips will help ensure the comfort and safety of everyone.\u201d Devised by the festival in collaboration with Writing WA and the State Library of Western Australia, the plan recommended identifying \u201coff-limits\u201d topics with panellists in advance, forgoing audience Q&amp;As if they risked becoming too inflammatory, and pre-arranging physical signals that would allow panellists to communicate their discomfort. Two designated protest areas would be set up outside the venue, and security staff would be able to step in if needed; \u201cescalation procedures in case of a disruption\u201d would be sent later in the week. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The missive ahead of the event, which is on now, was delivered in \u201ca mutual spirit of safety, inclusivity, respect, courtesy and tolerance\u201d, and to create \u201ca safe space [for panellists] to share their voices\u201d. It is also a sign of the times. \u2018Event organisers have a duty of care\u2019 Writers\u2019 festivals have always married literary discussion with topical issues, bringing authors and commentators together to discuss not just their work but the world around it. Occasional flare-ups and stoushes are to be expected \u2013 but as debates over the Middle East crisis continue to filter through to all areas of public life, it has had a particularly divisive effect on Australia\u2019s arts industry, where pre-emptive risk management appears to be a new development. In a statement to the Guardian, Perth festival\u2019s artistic director, Iain Grandage, and Writing WA\u2019s chief executive, William Yeoman, said the festival had the responsibility to ensure the safety, comfort and enjoyment of all participants and staff. \u201cAll event organisers have a duty to care for their attenders and it is standard, prudent practice for them to consider a wide range of measures in their event management plans,\u201d the statement said. For Perth writers\u2019 weekend, the new safety measures haven\u2019t come out of nowhere. Last week an open letter to the festival was signed by hundreds of artists, musicians and academics, calling on the festival and Writing WA to issue a public apology to the Palestinian community over the decision to platform headliner Deborah Conway, an avowed Zionist, in its literature and ideas program. In January, Perth festival was already responding to complaints by unspecified groups over diversity and representation in the program. \u201cWhile programming decisions were made prior to these conflicts breaking out \u2026 we are bringing more authors to the writers\u2019 weekend,\u201d Yeoman wrote in an email in January. First Nations artist Mabel Gibson and three writers of Arab heritage were subsequently added to the lineup. \u2018We have to be able to hear other people\u2019 Controversy at Australian writers\u2019 festivals is nothing new. In 2016, Yassmin Abdel-Magied famously walked out of Lionel Shriver\u2019s keynote address at the Brisbane writers\u2019 festival, and accused the We Need to Talk About Kevin author of delivering \u201ca poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension\u201d. In 2018, the Sydney writer\u2019s festival became the scene of an international scandal, after American-Dominican novelist Junot D\u00edaz was publicly accused of sexual misconduct by a member of the audience, American writer Zinzi Clemmons. Diaz cancelled his scheduled appearances at the festival, and has denied the allegations. Ahead of last year\u2019s Adelaide writer\u2019s week, a storm brewed over the inclusion of Susan Abulhawa, a Palestinian-American writer who had described Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a \u201cNazi-promoting Zionist\u201d on Twitter; and Palestinian poet Mohammed El-Kurd, whose poetry the Anti-Defamation League criticised as antisemitic. Sponsors pulled out, as did three Ukrainian authors, and Adler faced down the media, arguing against the conflation of criticism of Israel with antisemitism, and arguing for the freedom of discussion and debate. \u201cNone of this is simple,\u201d she told the Guardian at the time. \u201cPeople are free to deeply object.\u201d A fortnight away from this year\u2019s festival, Adler has found herself once more in the firing line after The Australian\u2019s literary editor Caroline Overington described the 2024 program as being \u201cpositively stuffed with guests whose views on the conflict in the Middle East are frothingly anti-Israel\u201d. \u201cThere are five writers talking about the history of the Middle East, five out of 202 writers, and not one of them would agree with the other,\u201d Adler told the Guardian this week. \u201cIf that\u2019s called a program packed with anti-Israel individuals, then [The Australian] and I are obviously working with different abacuses.\u201d Adler says there will be no new safety measures put in place for this year\u2019s writer\u2019s week. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a civil, courteous and polite exchange of views. Yes, sometimes views are expressed with passion \u2013 but why are we so frightened of that?\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to be able to hear other people, that\u2019s what I think is important. And passion or commitment to one\u2019s opinion is perfectly legitimate.\u201d \u201cThe moderators have the power of the microphone, and the right to switch it off during Q&amp;As if an audience member becomes offensive, racist or derogatory,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be done with dignity and authority.\u201d \u2018The more you mediate this, the less you fulfil the brief\u2019 Before he was editor of the Monthly, Michael Williams was artistic director of Sydney writers\u2019 festival, and head programmer for the Wheeler Centre. He\u2019s a frequent moderator of panels and talks at writers\u2019 festivals, which he sees as platforms for public discourse where conflicts of opinion are inevitable. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be in a place where there\u2019s public protests or anxiety expressed about government policy, or questions being asked about human rights, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be putting on a public ideas festival right now, because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly the narrowest and most prescriptive program avoids being about the world at large.\u201d Williams says he understands Perth festival\u2019s anxiety over maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all participants. \u201cBut short of making sure that people avoid deliberately hurting or vilifying others, going beyond that comes across as overthinking,\u201d he says. \u201cThe value of a writers\u2019 festival is that it is live \u2013 people who have thought deeply about the ideas coming together to talk in an organic way with each other and with readers. And the more you mediate this \u2013 the more you try and filter that through a set of pre-scripted things or preconditions \u2013 the less it\u2019s fulfilling the brief of what you want a good live literary event to be.\u201d Perth festival\u2019s statement underlined that its plan was to encourage, not limit, lively and free discussion, \u201cin a mutual spirit of safety, inclusivity, respect and courtesy\u201d. \u201cOur intention, as always, is to equip artists with the most comfortable circumstances possible to be themselves.\u201d Talks festivals need to strike a balance \u201cbetween tone policing and content policing\u201d, Williams says \u2013 and the increasingly complicated role played by organisational boards should not be underestimated either. \u201cCultural boards now have lots of pressures on them from sponsors and donors and participants alike, and they\u2019re trying to achieve that balance,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an invidious task.\u201d Perth writers\u2019 weekend runs until Sunday 25 February.

        "body": "If I were to be cast away on the proverbial desert island, the luxury I would choose to take with me would be earrings. I am not proud of this. It is a little bit embarrassing, probably. But I share it to give you an idea of how obsessed I am with earrings. I often leave the house with no makeup on, but never without earrings (although it occasionally happens by mistake). The other morning, a ring of the doorbell knocked my getting ready off stride, and by the time I realised I was earring-less I was almost at the tube station, too late to turn back. I felt like I\u2019d gone to work in my slippers. I don\u2019t for a minute suggest you join me in my weapons-grade earring fixation. Think of it like this: I compulsively overthink earrings so that you don\u2019t have to. And as a result, I can today bring you a download of where we are at with earrings: which style, which colour, how many, matched or mismatched. The most important thing you need to know right now is: earrings should be definite, not dangly. They can be a chunk or they can be a sliver, but they should be solid. Chandelier earrings, all their tinkle and flutter, are not where we are at. What you want is a confident, glamazon earring. Think back to the kind of earrings Samantha wore in early episodes of Sex and the City. They were nuggets of gold, with the chunky energy of a man\u2019s signet ring, gleaming at her lobes as she eyed up her prey over a cosmo. That\u2019s what we\u2019re after. Not necessarily gold, though. After years of the yellow stuff being the only metal in town, silver is seriously cool again. And I\u2019m not loving rose gold as much as I once did. Also, a rule that I stuck to religiously until recently \u2013 that mixing silver and gold was as much of a faux pas as wearing odd socks \u2013 has fallen away. Silver and gold look good together now. Pearls are still the jewel to beat, although they look best when they are classic with a twist. Look for wonky pebble-shaped rather than perfect little globes. Less Queen Elizabeth II, more Vivienne Westwood, god rest their souls. On the subject of queens, next on the agenda is mismatched earrings. What you need to know on this topic is that Queen Camilla is now wearing them. So, yup, mismatched is still a thing, but no longer one that\u2019s winning you edgy style points. The total number of earrings matters more and, right now, two is a bit vanilla. An extra piercing or two in each ear is a quick, effective and relatively painless update. I have three piercings in one ear, and am planning to add a second to the solo one on the other lobe. A non-matching number of piercings works best, for some reason. Make sure to get your extra piercings on your best side (everyone has one, just take some selfies from different angles if you don\u2019t believe me) as they will draw attention to that view of your face. One of my favourite combinations is to wear a line of three matching chunky drops in one ear, and something different on the other side. Back to that desert island. Which earrings would I take? Tough call, but I would probably land on a gold hoop. I\u2019ve been wearing them since I was a teenager and haven\u2019t tired of them yet, so I am pretty confident they\u2019d keep me cheerful however long it would take for my ship to come. Even better, hoops are practical for an active life \u2013 you can lie on your side in comfort and they don\u2019t tend to snag on your clothes, which is useful, because it means I don\u2019t have to take them off for pilates or worry about losing them in the changing room. So I would be able to sunbathe with my trusty desert-island Complete Works of Shakespeare without a metal post digging into my skull, and they would be less likely to get dislodged if I had to take my sweater off to flag down a passing boat. Look, I don\u2019t recommend you think about earrings as much as I do. But maybe give your lobes a once-over? For me. Model: Charlotte Robinson at Milk. Styling assistant: Sam Deaman.

On Radio 4 on Monday, in the ever-tricky 6.30pm comedy slot, we find One Person Found This Helpful, a panel show hosted by the nonstop funny machine that is Frank Skinner. He is a uniquely listenable audio presence. His Absolute weekend show (with Emily Dean and Alun Cochrane as his foils) is consistently hilarious, yet he doesn\u2019t do much more than tell listeners what he\u2019s been up to over the previous few days. The other week, he spent a lot of time chatting about his gigs. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to take the dog to the next one. She\u2019ll be by the side of the stage. I hope she\u2019s not frightened by laughter. Or she may die.\u201d Rubbish written down, but it\u2019s the way he tells \u2019em. In OPFTH, Skinner is as super-relaxed and witty as always. The idea behind the show, devised by panel member Simon Evans and writer Jason Hazeley, is that the guests guess what\u2019s being discussed from the online reviews Skinner reads out. It\u2019s all good clean fun, plus the panellists (Evans, Jessica Fostekew, Amy Gledhill, Ahir Shah) seem to enjoy themselves, which is about 90% of any panel show\u2019s appeal. Reviews were read out for household items (one, which sounded saucy, turned out to be a spatula), as well as novels and films. Another round had the panellists giving a funny response to a Tripadvisor slating, before Skinner gave us the real response. One of these, where a customer had slagged off the size of the pizza they were served, was: \u201cHello, Jean. We are an animal rehoming centre and do not serve pizzas.\u201d Genuinely funny and entertaining, One Person Found This Helpful may actually be a panel show that lasts. And so to\u2026 the Daily Mail. Not usually where I look for podcast fun: the newspaper\u2019s most popular podcast offerings are all along the lines of its blow-by-blow account of the Lucy Letby trial. There\u2019s a similar show about the trial of Brianna Ghey\u2019s murderers, as well as the trial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, which is still going on. Absolutely not my podcast cup of tea; I\u2019m far too easily upset. But! Here comes a more enticing offer: Straight to the Comments! YouTube pranking stars Josh (Pieters) &amp; Archie (Manners) \u2013 a South African and a posh English guy \u2013 interview a celebrity using the Daily Mail\u2019s online comments as a jump-off point. So Josh reads out a comment about the celebrity, and the celebrity involved, along with Archie, has to guess what the comments are about \u2013 what they were doing or saying or appearing in. For the first show, the celebrity was 2018 Love Island winner Dani Dyer. Having read plenty of the Mail\u2019s below-the-lines rantings in my time, I imagine it took producers a while to find anything that could actually be read out about Dyer. Mail commentators don\u2019t tend to like pretty, perky, working-class women. Not that Dyer would care. She\u2019s resilient, quick-witted and sweet, as well as able to take the mickey out of herself; the perfect first guest. I could have done without Archie having to guess who she was from the comments before she arrived (and surely listeners will already know, just from the title information), but once that was done the show lickety-splitted along with plenty of laughs and upbeat revelations. You could make a (slightly tortured) connection with these series to The Rise and Rise of the Microchip, Misha Glenny\u2019s new documentary series on Radio 4. Who would have thought that the microchip would lead to us all being so interconnected that we can leave reviews of people\u2019s actual lives? To be honest, Glenny might have. He\u2019s so clever, and communicates with such ease and clarity that you too feel clever just listening to him. In The Rise and Rise\u2026 he dances through the history of the microchip and explains a different international interconnection: an iPhone is \u201ccreated in the US, with a chip designed in the UK, manufactured in Taiwan and assembled in China\u201d. There are so many amazing facts here, just casually mentioned: nearly all microchips are made in Taiwan, so an escalation of its government\u2019s conflict with China would \u201cdefault globally\u201d, says an expert \u201cwith a much greater impact than Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine\u201d. Fantastically interesting stuff, beautifully delivered. Much hoo-ha about Jordan North leaving Radio 1 to front the Capital Breakfast show from April. It\u2019s a high-profile gig; he follows in the footsteps of Roman Kemp, who has been an excellent main host for the past 10 years. But North has actually worked at Capital before, in the north-east and Manchester. Obviously there\u2019s always fuss when Global poaches BBC stars (Chris Stark, who\u2019s on Capital Breakfast, was Scott Mills\u2019s sidekick for many years), but it should be remembered that the BBC has often snapped up commercial music presenters too. Vick Hope, North\u2019s co-host at Radio 1 in the teatime slot, used to be on Capital Breakfast herself, from 2017 to 2020. Though I\u2019ve no doubt North will be excellent, he\u2019s protected from any failure by the enormous success of his podcast Help, I Sexted My Boss, which he hosts with William Hanson. Help\u2026 is made by Audio Always, an indie production company. Perhaps such a show sits more easily alongside hosting on a commercial station rather than the BBC? Either way, the warm and jovial North is flying right now, and Capital must be very happy to have landed him.",

        "body": "Michael Donkor, 39, was born in London to Ghanaian parents. His first novel, Hold (2018), about three teenage girls, was listed for the Dylan Thomas prize and the Desmond Elliott prize. His second, Grow Where They Fall, follows Kwame, a secondary school teacher, which was Donkor\u2019s own job until his recent move to Lisbon, where he now works as a bookseller. Where did this book begin? I\u2019d had some experiences \u2013 some challenging, some comic \u2013 of being in incredibly white environments, and I wondered whether a novel might be a place to think through those experiences. It wasn\u2019t that after publishing Hold I just woke up and was like, OK, now I\u2019m going to write the book about me. Nothing Kwame goes through specifically happened to me. He\u2019s more someone I wished I\u2019d had around in those racially vexed moments when I felt uncertain about what was going on in a room. I thought of him as the person I wanted to see when the headteacher was in the staff room saying: \u201cOh, we need to do more stuff about Black history,\u201d and I could sense people looking at me. I\u2019d desperately wanted someone to lock eyes with and be like, \u201cThis is weird, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Did your work as a teacher give you a fund of material for fiction? Making Kwame a teacher felt a slight risk because I worried I wouldn\u2019t know how to use my knowledge in a way that wasn\u2019t just me writing polemic: \u201cI\u2019ve been teaching for over a decade at three different places, let me tell you what I know\u2026\u201d I could write another two whole novels about that! I was keen to show the ordinariness of the exchanges between Kwame and his students. In the political conversation about education, there\u2019s little attention paid to the real human work \u2013 what it costs for a person to wake up at 6am and finish at 8pm after marking and to have more than 100 conversations every single day. What led you to the book\u2019s matter-of-fact candour about gay sex? Sometimes in queer novels there\u2019s a titillating quality; I wanted the sex to feel sexy but I didn\u2019t want people rubbing their thighs. Did I sense my teacherly responsibilities or the attitudes I suppose my students might have reading a novel where Mr Donkor\u2019s written about willies and cum and stuff? I don\u2019t know how I managed this, but honestly, when I sit down to write, I forget everyone else: it\u2019s just me, the characters and the 500 words I\u2019ve set myself to tackle. In writing a big social novel full of dialogue, did you feel like you were working against the trend for more interior, fragmentary novels? I really admire Deborah Levy and Rachel Cusk but much as I enjoy flintier stuff, I also enjoy a good yarn: the sort of novel where you think, I\u2019m going to be held in a close embrace for 400 pages in a world that is very fully described. I really like novels where there\u2019s a sense of the narrator being conversational. That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re necessarily in slang or dialect \u2013 it\u2019s about creating a voice that is inviting and feels like someone is speaking the novel to you. When I\u2019m writing I read my work aloud a lot; I want it to sound as if you\u2019re mid-conversation rather than something distant and arch. Name a novel you\u2019ve enjoyed recently. Something I\u2019ve been recommending in the bookshop where I work is Constance Debr\u00e9\u2019s Love Me Tender. I love its gutsiness: how she can be the sort of mother she wants to be, and how she can mother herself as she goes through this transitional moment of fully embracing her queerness, were questions I found really compelling. And the sex was fun and direct: \u201cNo need to be nervous but, yes, I\u2019m going to talk about my dildo now.\u201d I also loved Vladimir [by Julia May Jonas], for its wildly unpredictable over-the-topness and astute understanding of the negotiations involved in long-term relationships. How come you left London for Lisbon? It was a post-pandemic, let\u2019s-do-something-adventurous decision. We came in July 2022. My husband and I got married here six years ago and we know the city quite well. People ask me: \u201cIs it really creatively inspiring? Are its colours making you think in new ways?\u201d I\u2019m like, I dunno; so far I only know what it\u2019s like to edit a novel here! Among the English-language community there\u2019s definitely a developing creative writing scene. There\u2019s this huge influx of British and American people and lots of them have creative ambitions. People from San Francisco and Stoke Newington tell me they\u2019re in the middle of writing their Lisbon novel. So I would not be surprised if there\u2019s a new kind of genre in the next five years, the Lisbon expat novel \u2013 it\u2019s coming, I think. Tell us about a novel you remember reading as a child. I was about 11 the first time I read a novel about Ghana: Comfort Herself, by Geraldine Kaye, who was actually a white woman. It\u2019s about a British-Ghanaian girl in Ghana for the first time. She doesn\u2019t like the food, she\u2019s confused about the values of the place and thinks her grandmother\u2019s really harsh; then her relationship with this place that she\u2019s from, but didn\u2019t feel like she was from, develops and softens. I experienced the thrill of reading something and thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve been there, it is like that!\u201d As I\u2019ve gotten older, that magic of representation has a slightly different quality. The question of representation feels more nuanced for me now \u2013 it needs to be more than: \u201cLet\u2019s write a documentary-type novel about what it means to be Black.\u201d I want more specificity: to say something new or different to make us reconsider what we think we know about Black experience. Grow Where They Fall will be published on 7 March by Fig Tree (\u00a316.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply",

        "body": "Cindy Tripp, still recovering from a surgery she\u2019d undergone earlier that week, convinced her husband to accompany her to Patriots Point on Friday night to watch Nikki Haley rally supporters one last time before the voters of South Carolina rendered their verdict in the Republican presidential primary. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be here,\u201d Tripp said, laughing as the sun set over the USS Yorktown aircraft carrier, the backdrop for Haley\u2019s rally on the eve of the Republican primary. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t miss this because I\u2019m so proud of her.\u201d Tripp, who turns 60 next week, cast her ballot for Haley just after polls opened on the first day of early voting on 12 February. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary, she has worked to get out the vote in South Carolina, where Haley is bracing for a loss to Donald Trump in the state that twice elected her governor. But some of her supporters are vowing to stick with their candidate until the end. Haley is Trump\u2019s last remaining primary rival. Casting herself as David taking on Goliath, she has refused to drop out of the race, thrilling voters like Tripp who say they no longer feel welcome in Trump\u2019s Republican party. \u201cNikki represents an opportunity for us to finally speak,\u201d Tripp said. On a Beast of the South-East bus tour across her \u201csweet\u201d South Carolina, Haley was often greeted by crowds of women and girls eager to see her make history. But also \u2013 and more importantly, they emphasize \u2013 she would restore a sense of normalcy to American politics. \u201cShe\u2019s not the best woman for the job. She\u2019s the best person for the job,\u201d said Judith Smith, who carried a homemade Run Nikki Run sign at a Haley event in Moncks Corner on Friday. South Carolina primary: read more When to expect South Carolina results Key dates for the 2024 election Who\u2019s running for president? Haley\u2019s steep odds in South Carolina Those like Smith who recall Haley\u2019s tenure as governor point to her stewardship of the state\u2019s economy and her leadership in the wake of the racist massacre at the historically Black Mother Emanuel AME Church in 2015. Others cite her foreign policy experience as United Nations ambassador under Trump. But a not insignificant source of her support is her opponent. \u201cTo be honest, I hate Trump,\u201d said Barbara Bates, 76, of Goose Creek, when asked about her support for Haley. Bates \u2013 a Republican who voted for Haley as governor, and who was wearing a Haley campaign shirt that quipped \u201cunderestimate me, that will be fun\u201d \u2013 said she was under no illusion that Trump could be stopped from winning the nomination. She nevertheless believed it was important for Haley to stand in his way as he attempts to stamp out any strain of resistance to his nomination. \u201cI appreciate her hanging in and not dropping out,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIn 2020 I didn\u2019t get a vote in the presidential primary because South Carolina went ahead and anointed Trump. At least she gave me a vote.\u201d With most of the Republican base in Trump\u2019s thrall, Haley\u2019s coalition is a hodgepodge of conservatives who remember her as the \u201cTea Party governor\u201d, and anti-Trump Republicans and independents disillusioned by the prospect of a November rematch between Trump, a 77-year-old former president facing 91 felony charges, and Joe Biden, the deeply unpopular incumbent. She also appeals to some Democrats fearful of a Trump second term and indifferent toward Biden. South Carolina is among the states that allow registered Democrats to vote in the Republican primary \u2013 as long as they didn\u2019t participate in their party\u2019s contest earlier this month. At an event in Georgetown this week, Morgan Derrick, a self-described \u201ccurious Democrat\u201d, said she liked Haley\u2019s foreign policy approach and her economic plans. But she has concerns with Haley\u2019s conservative views on abortion. Derrick said abortion was \u201cprobably the highest policy on my mind\u201d though she had disagreements with Biden on other issues, leaving her unsure of how she would vote. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated field out there,\u201d Derrick said. A Suffolk University/USA Today poll of South Carolina Republican primary voters found that 59% of respondents who identified themselves as liberals or moderates said they\u2019d vote for the former South Carolina governor, compared with just 38% who said they would back Trump. Among those who said the most important issue of the future is democracy, 63% favored Haley. Not all of Haley\u2019s supporters are anti-Trump. Some are enthusiastically pro-Haley. A group of Republican women cheered wildly and danced in the crowd as they waited for Haley\u2019s bus to arrive in Moncks Corner. Some wore shirts that said \u201cbarred permanently\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump\u2019s threat to ex-communicate any donor who continued giving to her campaign. Several of those same supporters arrived at Haley\u2019s evening event wearing feather boas and \u201cwomen for Nikki\u201d pins. They praised her as a \u201crole model\u201d and a \u201cleader\u201d who was \u201csmart as a whip\u201d and could unify the country. When she finishes speaking, Haley is regularly mobbed by women and young girls, who often receive extra attention from the candidate. She autographs their posters with a heart and a personalized note and poses for selfies. \u201cShe seems like a voice for the future,\u201d said Trish Mooney, 60, who attended a Haley event in Georgetown this week. Haley has also attracted a loyal group of out-of-state volunteers, some who have followed her campaign from Iowa. A Massachusetts man handing out yard signs in Moncks Corner said he felt compelled to do what he could to defeat Trump. Marti Leib, an independent who said she never votes a straight party-line ticket, came from Florida with her tiny dog, Kipper, to support Haley\u2019s campaign in the state. In a view shared by several attendees at the candidate\u2019s Friday campaign stops, Leib said the November election presents an existential choice for Americans \u2013 and that Haley is the only candidate left in the race who can save the country. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something right this election season, we\u2019re gonna fall like the Roman empire,\u201d said Leib, 73. \u201cIt\u2019s downright scary.\u201d Despite Haley\u2019s dwindling odds, some of her most loyal supporters aren\u2019t ready to confront the question of who they will vote for in November if \u2013 but if they\u2019re honest, when \u2013 she drops out of the race. \u201cThat\u2019s like choosing between a hedgehog and a porcupine,\u201d said Smith. Neither, she clarified, were desirable choices.",

The cast of the biographical epic won for best ensemble, ahead of Barbie and Killers of the Flower Moon. Cillian Murphy picked up male actor in a leading role, which was also contested by Paul Giamatti and Jeffrey Wright. \u201cThis is extremely, extremely special to me because it comes from you guys,\u201d he told the audience at Los Angeles\u2019 Shrine Auditorium. Robert Downey Jr won for male actor in a supporting role for playing Lewis Strauss in the film. The actor had previously won a Sag award for Ally McBeal in 2001. Lily Gladstone took home female actor in a leading role for Killers of the Flower Moon, beating Emma Stone and Margot Robbie. \u201cThis has been a hard year for all of us,\u201d she said before referencing 2023\u2019s actors strike. \u201cWe bring empathy into a world that so much needs it,\u201d she added. The Holdovers star Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph was named best female actor in a supporting role after winning a string of awards this season, including a Bafta and a Golden Globe. She called the film\u2019s director Alexander Payne \u201ctruly every actor\u2019s dream\u201d and said to actors who are still waiting for a breakout: \u201cYour life can change in a day and it is not a question of if but of when, keep going.\u201d In a surprise victory, The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal won for male actor in a drama series, beating out three more hotly tipped Succession stars including recent Emmy winners Kieran Culkin and Matthew Macfadyen. He joked in his speech that he was drunk as he didn\u2019t think he would win. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have a panic attack and I\u2019m gonna leave,\u201d he said at the end. Elizabeth Debicki was named female actor in a drama series for The Crown, beating out Succession\u2019s Sarah Snook. But the final season of the hit HBO financial drama did go on to win the night\u2019s big TV award for drama ensemble. Star Alan Ruck called the win \u201cone last hurrah\u201d. The Bear picked up three awards, including for comedy ensemble, against Abbott Elementary and Only Murders in the Building. Jeremy Allen White was also named best male actor in a comedy series for his role. \u201cWow, they give you a lot of time at this one but that\u2019s all I have!\u201d he joked at the end of his speech. His co-star Ayo Edebiri won for female actor in a comedy series after recently winning both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for the role. Ali Wong won yet another award for her role in Netflix series Beef, picking up best female actor in a TV movie or limited series, while her co-star Steven Yeun also won for male actor. This year\u2019s life achievement award was given to Barbra Streisand, introduced by Jennifer Aniston, who said she was \u201cinspired by her magic\u201d, and Bradley Cooper, who referred to her as \u201ca true auteur\u201d. Accepting the award, Streisand said she was \u201cvery proud\u201d to be a member of the union for the past 60 years. \u201cI never went to college, I always thought acting was my education,\u201d she said. She talked of the Jewish studio heads who changed their names to escape bigotry in Europe. \u201cI dream of a world where such prejudice is a thing of the past,\u201d she said to applause. The past year saw Sag members strike in order to reach fairer contract terms. In an introduction, Idris Elba paid tribute to all of those who \u201cstood up in solidarity\u201d with members. Later in the night, Sag-aftra president Fran Drescher spoke about the strike to the audience. \u201cYou survived the longest strike in our union\u2019s history with courage and conviction,\u201d she said before thanking actors for their \u201ccollective dignity and perseverance\u201d. She added: \u201cAI will entrap us in a matrix where no one will know what\u2019s real.\u201d The ceremony was made available on Netflix, a rare example of the streamer dabbling with live programming.

        "body": "Designers at fashion week are often asked to justify their luxurious creations when the showcase takes place against a backdrop of tumultuous global politics. For Giorgio Armani, it is about joy and renewal, he said. Armani, who launched his eponymous brand in 1975, has had time and experience to consider the role fashion can play in these circumstances. \u201cThis is a question I am often asked and I myself wonder what the role of fashion is in such difficult times,\u201d he told the Guardian before his Milan fashion week show on Sunday morning. \u201cFor me, what fashion can do is convey a sense of renewal, but also joy. We aren\u2019t changing the world, nor can we solve the world\u2019s problems, but we can give people a moment of lightness, the feeling of being different, new and even more beautiful. These are small pleasures, but sometimes small things can make a big difference.\u201d It is a sentiment other big names in Milan have expressed over the course of this week. At a preview for her show on Friday, Donatella Versace told the press: \u201cClothes don\u2019t give you all the strength, but some of it,\u201d while Miuccia Prada said the starting point for her collection with her co-creative director, Raf Simons, was \u201can instinctive need for love and goodness \u2026 especially in a time like this\u201d. For his autumn/winter 2024 collection, Armani said he was inspired by winter flowers as a representation of hope. \u201cA flower blooming in the cold is a symbol of rebirth, which is what I would like to communicate at this time,\u201d he said.

        "body": "If baby boomers had Countdown with Molly Meldrum, gen X had Recovery with Dylan Lewis. Every Saturday morning from 1996 to 2000, right after Rage, Recovery would take over the ABC for three hours of music videos, live performances and pop culture segments. It burned fast but it burned bright. Lewis is now back on air for the ABC \u2013 as the host of Double J Mornings, where he\u2019s again tasked with playing the best new music (and some older hits as well). He got into music via his late brother Quinn, whose guitar Lewis considers his most prized possession. Here he tells us about that cherished instrument and the stories of other important belongings. What I\u2019d save from my house in a fire I am the custodian of my brother\u2019s Ibanez steel-string acoustic guitar. It\u2019s really lovely to play and fun to be able to get right up the neck because of the cutaway. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning It\u2019s the guitar on which Quinn taught me Wish You Were Here. Every time I play it, I wish he was here. I think of his beautiful artist\u2019s hands on the fretboard and his nicotine-stained fingers strumming away effortlessly on the strings. And that makes me happy. I can feel the history in the wood. I can hear the stories in the strings. I can see the shape of his fingers when I look at mine \u2013 making shapes to make music. My brother is the reason I\u2019m into music and have made it my life and my career. The guitar is my greatest connection to him. I especially love when my kids play it. They never got to know their uncle since he passed away before they were born \u2013 but I feel like there\u2019s a bit of a magic connection when they play Uncle Q\u2019s guitar. My most useful object Slides. That sounds silly. But I\u2019ve thought about it long and hard and can\u2019t think of a better answer! I mean those slipper things normally reserved for the pool shower so you don\u2019t get tinea. Like the boxer shorts of thongs. Slides \u2026 but with socks. Always with socks. If you know, you know. When I first slid into slides in 2018 I thought it was funny. Then I realised it\u2019s not just funny. It feels safe. It feels secure. It\u2019s naughty. It\u2019s like a gentle embrace for your foot from a friend\u2019s hot mum. Soon after I saw some youths \u2013 like pre-eshays \u2013 wearing socks and slides in a rural shopping centre. As soon as I saw them, I realised this was not just some funny comfort. This was a farshun. I could rock this shiznay out and about in public \u2013 like a rock star. As soon as the pre-eshay youths were far enough away to not see an old man copy their style, I popped into the nearest surf shop and got myself some red slides and black socks. Sick combo. Since 2018 I\u2019ve requested Kenzo slides for every birthday, Father\u2019s Day and Christmas, and no one thinks I\u2019m being serious. I am. The item I most regret losing A gold Machine Man I won in the 80s. I used to collect Machine Men. They were like Transformers, but less successful. They were better quality than Transformers (not many loose bits that could be lost) and a better design (more metal). But somehow Transformers lasted and Machine Men didn\u2019t. The pie\u0300ce de re\u0301sistance in my collection was a gold Porsche Machine Man. The only way to get one was to win it, and this was in the pre-internet days of the mid-80s. I had to collect a bunch of barcodes from the toy packaging and send them to Japan. And I won. It was the greatest feeling ever: I possessed a rare Machine Man! I took it carefully through my childhood, always putting it on display. And I took it carefully through every sharehouse I lived in and every house we\u2019ve owned (someone\u2019s doing well). And then one day it was gone. Along with all my Machine Men, except one. I don\u2019t know if they were left in a removal van or accidentally chucked out with some boxes or taken by faeries? But I reckon I think about my gold Porsche every day. And I still hold out hope for his return some day. Dylan Lewis hosts Double J Mornings from 9am Monday to Thursday",

        "body": "I remember this one assembly. I was seven, eight? And the headteacher was talking about what makes a book. I guess it must have been around whatever passed for World Book Day back then. No Harry Potter costumes for us in those days, no Elsa-from-Frozen (because-we-have-the-activity-book-actually), no, these were the days when we would take it in turns to read from the papyrus scroll, perhaps in a little pretend Shakespeare beard if our mums remembered to pluck the goat the night before. But I remember Mr Bainbridge\u2019s assembly as revelatory and sort of beautiful. He talked about the way imagination could blossom, then be corralled into words, and how these words could be lined up on a printing block, and there was something, I think, about growing a tree for its paper, and then, how this story was bound and protected by its cover, and how each of these little folders were impossibly precious. He inspired in me, back then, a kind of reverence for books. But lord, my admiration is nothing compared to the dislocated, swooning awe for the book as object that exists today. \u201cBookshelf wealth\u201d has been named 2024\u2019s \u201cfirst major design trend\u201d. This is the new name for a home stacked with hundreds of carefully curated books and it is situated as the interior design version of fashion\u2019s \u201cquiet luxury\u201d. Quiet luxury, you\u2019ll remember, is the trend for normal people (us) trying to dress like the super-wealthy (them) and spending the equivalent of a car on a cardigan that we believe will help us pass as rich and give us access to a world that would otherwise treat us with disdain. In this context, books are valuable, but not for their ability to titillate, terrify, educate, no none of that \u2013 they are valuable for the way their presence communicates a particular kind of educated class. Today, any discussion of book ownership will spark great wars. Whole identities are founded on the thing, it being more acceptable, in this climate, to post online the pile of books one has read this month than to walk through town singing, \u201cI\u2019m a very clever boy.\u201d And this interiors trend is no different, with sides having rapidly formed. There are the lifestyle girlies, who appreciate the cosy aesthetic, and then there\u2019s everyone else, some of whom have gone quite mad: the New York Times quotes one disgusted critic saying, \u201cThe day I \u2018cultivate\u2019 books instead of buying what I like to read is the day I\u2019ll know I\u2019ve truly failed as a human.\u201d I take no sides. Not me, not old Eva! But I do find it interesting that so many care so much. Care that some ladies on TikTok are besmirching their precious lit-er-a-ture by pointing out that a shelf of books adds colour and texture to a room, rather than, as is presumably correct, critiquing the prose inside them in a series of online essays? But both the fors and the againsts (the againsts being self-identified \u201creaders\u201d) share a reverence for books as objects that must be fought for and displayed, that act as identity markers, and signifiers for rich inner lives. Do the againsts resent the fors, for saying their quiet bits out loud? For acknowledging that a book is more than just the sum of its parts? To me, the success of this trend says less about books today, which have been used as a kind of intellectual set-dressing for centuries; as long as books have existed, there has been a sad-eyed man or glamorous woman carrying one as an accessory to convey soul and status. It says, I think, more about a reality of deep insecurity, both in the rabid reaction from readers, who feel their identities are threatened by the use of books as design, and in the popularity of the trend itself. The bookshelves full of novels don\u2019t just point at an interior life lived richly, but at a way of living, in the kind of home where you won\u2019t be evicted because the landlord wants to paint the bathroom and double the rent. These are shelves that speak of a kind of permanence: those drawn towards this aesthetic don\u2019t just want to be seen as people who can read (decorators have long bought old books by the metre), but as people who have had the time and wealth to slowly build a home, full of things that have helped shape who they have gradually become. Like quiet luxury, which worked to defang its fans and exposed our kinky relationship with the super rich, the appeal of bookshelf wealth and its ensuing outrage tells us something uncomfortable about our culture. About the upsettingly humble aspiration \u2013 to live safely among our precious stories \u2013 that led to its virality as a trend, in the power we place in books, how they signify class, and in the bitter ways we find ourselves when in opposition to others who, in this case, \u201cget books wrong\u201d. And, a PS to parents of primary school children, who will wake soon, red and demented, asking WHY is there not a full Tom Gates costume in their wardrobe: World Book Day is just over a week away, and Burglar Bill wears a blue striped top, Wimpy Kid is just white T-shirt and jeans, and Sophie from The BFG wears a nightie, x.

        "body": "Every day is the same. Hirayama (K\u014dji Yakusho), a taciturn man in his 60s, wakes in his spartan apartment to the reluctant grey light of pre-dawn. He pulls on his overalls, takes a can of coffee from a street vending machine and sets out in his modest little van to start work, diligently cleaning the public toilets of Tokyo. It\u2019s a solitary life. Hirayama can go days saying no more than a few cursory words. If members of the public notice him, they largely view him as an inconvenience. But mostly they don\u2019t even see him. It should be the most soul-crushingly bleak film ever made \u2013 a Groundhog Day grind with added despair and urinal cakes. But Wim Wenders\u2019s zen meditation on beauty, fulfilment and simplicity is quite the opposite: it\u2019s an achingly lovely and unexpectedly life-affirming picture. It all depends \u2013 and this is central to the film\u2019s gently profound message \u2013 on your way of looking at things. Hirayama looks at the world with his eyes, but sees with his heart. There is a Japanese word, \u201ckomorebi\u201d, which was the original title of the film. Literally translated, it means \u201csunlight leaking through trees\u201d, but there\u2019s more to it than that. It speaks of a profound connection with nature, and the necessity to pause, to take the time to absorb and appreciate the perfection of tiny, seemingly insignificant details. Hirayama has not only grasped all of this, he has made it the keystone of his essence. He sees all things, all people, as equally important, with an equal capacity for transcendence. While other pedestrians ignore the vagrant who camps in a park, Hirayama watches in wonder as the man moves in his own dance of self-expression. And the toilets themselves, although humble in purpose, are architectural gems. Hirayama\u2019s ascetic existence is stripped back to basics: music, played on cassette tapes collected, we assume, in his long-ago youth; secondhand books bought from the budget section of the local bookstore; a point-and-shoot film camera with which he captures the things that please him; the interplay between the sky and the trees. Trees, it seems, have a particular significance for Hirayama, something that he pays back by carefully rescuing fragile Japanese maple seedlings in order to nurture them in his apartment. That this way of living lightly in the world seems as spiritually rewarding as it does is largely thanks to Yakusho\u2019s remarkable performance. The actor, whose previous films include Memoirs of a Geisha, Eureka and Babel, can convey an extraordinarily rich interior life, almost entirely without leaning on dialogue. Equally important in our understanding of Hirayama\u2019s journey through the world is the choice of music. He listens to 60s and 70s American and British rock \u2013 the Velvet Underground, the Kinks, Otis Redding, Patti Smith \u2013 and Japanese folk from the same period. The song choices \u2013 in particular the Lou Reed track that gives the film its title and Nina Simone\u2019s Feeling Good \u2013 are windows into his soul at any given moment. Hirayama has found harmony, although there are suggestions of a previous, more privileged life, in which this was not the case. This sense of peace and equanimity is a rare thing in the central character of a film \u2013 cinema, after all, thrives on conflict and discord. They don\u2019t call it drama for nothing. Perfect Days is, by no small margin, Wenders\u2019s most successful narrative film in a long time. With its gentle rhythms, leisurely pacing and quiet profundity, this Tokyo toilet story has an obvious debt to the work of Yasujir\u014d Ozu. But it also put me in mind of Federico Veiroj\u2019s slow cinema gem A Useful Life, and of Wenders\u2019s own masterpiece Wings of Desire. Hirayama might not be an angel, but there\u2019s something elevated about his quiet joy in the world around him. It\u2019s possible that Perfect Days \u2013 Oscar-nominated for best international feature \u2013 is as much a manifesto as it is a movie \u2013 an argument in favour of an alternative way of being. Perfection, the film argues, is found in a pared-down approach to the world and a rejection of the thirst for new sensations and novelty that drives so much of society. It\u2019s no accident that Hirayama favours analogue technology over digital \u2013 the cassette tapes, the film camera. The digital onslaught, with its noise and distractions, is in direct opposition to the spiritual peace and purity that he works towards each day. Perhaps, in its polite and unassuming way, the film advocates not just a new way of looking, but also a new way of living.",

Sampha-assisted Double Standards is a fabulous showcase for his elegant fury, covering hypocrisy, colourism, paedophilia and prejudice with courage and wisdom. Mount Rushmore (featuring fellow heads Kano and Wretch 32) has the best beat-and-flow marriage, but there\u2019s also solid work on Afrobeats and amapiano tracks such as Tumbi, Blessings and Hallelujah. This is a well-crafted collection that could maybe do with a couple more heaters, but will keep the wider audience he picked up with Conflict of Interest happy.",

        "body": "Now is as good a time as any to better understand Israel, and Michael Winterbottom may be the film-maker best placed to aid us in this understanding. His intelligent and compelling new romantic thriller is set in the late 1930s and early 1940s, among the bright young things of Mandatory Palestine, and like several of his previous films it inventively blends fact and fiction to tell a trueish story about daily life in a war zone. Shoshana Borochov (a charismatic Irina Starshenbaum) is the real-life figure cutting a dash through Tel Aviv high society in this exciting time of Jewish self-determination and utopian dreaming. She spends her days passionately debating politics at dockside cafes or dodging the bombs and bullets of the Zionist militant group Irgun. Her nights are reserved for conducting a dangerous love affair with a British intelligence officer, Tom Wilkin (Douglas Booth). In the current media-political climate, the film\u2019s total absence of Palestinian voices is glaring, but that\u2019s no fault of Winterbottom\u2019s storytelling. Shoshana clearly defines its own purview, giving valuable insight into the variance of opinion within the era\u2019s Zionist movement, while also highlighting the central role of a third player in this fraught and bloody history: British colonialism.",

When his twin siblings requested a saw for their second birthday, I realised I\u2019d crossed the Rubicon: I\u2019d become an accidental mother of Vikings. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. I relocated from London to Denmark, carefree and childless, but despite planning on staying just a year I\u2019m still here a decade and three children later. So I have skin in the Viking game. And Nordic children do things differently. They eat differently, learn differently, play, dress, even sleep differently \u2013 with babies left to nap outside in their prams in sub-zero temperatures. They sing, fight, climb, fall and get up again. They are out in nature for hours a day \u2013 despite the fact that the weather\u2019s terrible (we\u2019re talking Mordor from October to March). Nordics seldom come across as happy-go-lucky \u2013 preferring \u201cscheduled fun\u201d to anything approaching spontaneity. And yet\u2026 Nordic countries regularly top Unicef rankings in terms of happiness, education and equality with the highest rates of wellbeing, globally. Some aspects of their parenting can be applied wherever you are, while others can act as inspiration. So here are a few things I\u2019ve learned about how to raise a Viking. 1. Every day in every way, play Play is so big in the Nordic countries, they named it twice. The verb forms of \u201cplay\u201d in Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Icelandic and Norwegian refer specifically to enjoyable, unstructured and intrinsically motivated activities. But if you\u2019re playing sport, a board game, or a musical instrument, you use spille in Danish and Norwegian, spela in Swedish, spila in Icelandic and pelata in Finnish. Professor Ellen Beate Hansen Sandseter at Queen Maud University College Norway says: \u201cStudies following children from birth show that it\u2019s not the ones who climb a tree, fall and break a leg who have a fear of heights \u2013 it\u2019s the ones who never climbed a tree.\u201d Playfighting is another important part of a child\u2019s development, teaching cooperation, confidence and appropriate judgment. \u201cYou have to let kids fight sometimes,\u201d one Danish mum tells me. They need \u201cto have conflict, to see if they can solve it and get themselves to the peace table\u201d. Terrifying in the short term, helpful in the long run (or so I\u2019m told). 2. Teach children how to think not what to think Vikings don\u2019t start school until six years old (seven in Finland). They\u2019re eased in with short days, no grades, tests or homework until around age 11. Sabilah Eboo Alwani from the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge thinks this is a good thing, since: \u201cthe early onset of lots of homework erodes quality time from a developmental point of view.\u201d The Danish system is based on teaching according to interests and, \u201cThey\u2019re taught to think \u2013 not just pass exams,\u201d says teacher Louise Lingaard. Children learn to stand up for themselves, with public speaking part of the school routine from six, while reading comes later \u2013 around eight. By the age of 15, Nordic countries rank above the OECD average, with Finland ahead of the UK and the US overall. The lesson here, regardless of different schooling systems, is to let a child develop their own interests and read at their own pace. Research shows that putting pressure on children to read too early causes stress and later readers easily catch up with, and even surpass, early ones. 3. There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather Nordics of all nationalities have variations on this mantra and studies show that spending time outdoors improves cooperation, reduces stress, helps with concentration and evens out differences between low-achieving and high-achieving children. And yet, three-quarters of UK children spend less time outside than prison inmates. In Norway, friluftsliv \u2013 or \u201cfree air life\u201d \u2013 is akin to a secular religion and many Swedes attend Saturday \u201cnature school\u201d. From childhood, Nordics develop what Stanford University social psychologist Kari Leibowitz calls a \u201cpositive wintertime mindset\u201d. Learning to dress the part is key. \u201cIn much of the world when it\u2019s cold, people still dress normally to go out, then wonder why they\u2019re uncomfortable,\u201d says Leibowitz. My children now own snowsuits, rainsuits, \u201cwindsuits\u201d, balaclavas, thermal underwear, gloves, waterproof mitten \u201cshells\u201d, snow boots and rain boots. Develop a positive mindset by wearing more winter-friendly clothes and remember, there\u2019s no such thing as the wrong weather, only the wrong clothing. 4. Not every picture needs to go on the fridge While many cultures adopt the idea that constant praise enhances the development of self-esteem (\u201cWho\u2019s my CLEVER BOY! That\u2019s the BEST poo EVER!\u201d), Danes don\u2019t. Vikings believe that over-praise leads to inflated egos and a poor sense of self. This instils the idea that everyone is worthy, just because. \u201cWhen kids say, \u2018Look at this!\u2019 it\u2019s their way of requesting our attention,\u201d says Danish family therapist Sofie M\u00fcnster. \u201cThey\u2019re not actually asking for praise. So it\u2019s better to teach them to evaluate things for themselves, otherwise they\u2019ll spend their lives looking for external validation.\u201d As one friend put it: \u201cI would never know if my parents thought something I\u2019d done was good, but also, it wasn\u2019t important. I assumed they loved me. It was taken for granted, not based on achievement.\u201d Danes replace praise with interest and ask \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d or \u201cTell me more.\u201d \u201cThis shows children that we care about them \u2013 not their \u2018results\u2019,\u201d says M\u00fcnster. As well as less positive praise, there tends to be less negative judgment, too. When toddlers discover their autonomy in English-speaking countries, they\u2019re categorised as in the \u201cterrible twos\u201d. But in Danish, this is known as \u201cthe boundary age\u201d since pushing boundaries is normal \u2013 not \u201cterrible\u201d. 5. Singing together is good for society Danes love to sing and many schools still have group singing every morning, proven to release the bonding hormone oxytocin, which lowers stress, while the synchronicity of breathing together creates feelings of connectedness. Researchers from Aarhus University found that singing strengthens feelings of community and social cohesion. During the pandemic, Danish choirmaster Phillip Faber led daily singalongs on the Danish equivalent of the BBC to boost morale. \u201cMany confuse \u2018group singing\u2019 with \u2018beautiful-sounding choirs\u2019,\u201d says Faber, \u201cbut it\u2019s the experience rather than the outcome that matters. In a world where everything is \u2018me me me\u2019, singing together is like a starry night. You feel small and insignificant, but also not alone and as though you belong. It\u2019s the best feeling in the world.\u201d Disappearing into group singing is the perfect communal pursuit for the nation that brought us Jante\u2019s Law \u2013 a set of attitudes said to govern Danish life where everyone is equal and showing off is frowned upon. It doesn\u2019t have to sound good \u2013 it just has to feel good. 6. Family meals are sacred The idea of sitting down and eating as a family is highly valued in Nordic society. Even a CEO is allowed to say in a meeting at 4pm, \u201cI have to leave now to pick up the kids.\u201d And then go home, to eat as a family. Most Danish homes are centred around a dining table for the express purpose of prioritising family mealtimes. Wherever you live, there are still real benefits in aiming for a homemade family meal once a week to reconnect. If you can cook from scratch even better, but bear in mind it\u2019s less about what you eat for dinner and more about who you eat it with. 7. Accept that family comes in many forms There are 37 different types of family unit in Denmark, while Sweden, Norway and Iceland have more births outside marriage than within it \u2013 67% of Icelandic babies are born out of wedlock. In the US and the UK, these family formations are associated with being worse off and can attract stigma, but in Nordic countries, they\u2019re embraced. Former Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin was raised by two female parents, while Denmark\u2019s prime minister Mette Frederiksen came to power as a single mother of two. No matter how a family is formed, there\u2019s a broad acceptance \u2013 and children learn this from a young age \u2013 that each family is different but equal with its own strengths and flaws\u2026 just like ours.

        "body": "While many student flats are infested with unwanted mice, 20 years ago I voluntarily filled mine with rats. I began with two from a pet shop, but ended up taking on several more rescues, buying an enormous cage so they could climb and dig and play. Lots of people don\u2019t like rats, but they are wonderful animals and a great alternative if you don\u2019t have time or space for a dog. Rats are clever, clean and full of personality and affection. But none of mine had as much personality as Letty, the rat I found in a bin. She had clearly been someone\u2019s pet, though I never found out whose, or how she had ended up on the streets. On a visit home from university one Christmas, I went for a drink with a friend who mentioned that he had seen a black-and-white rat in a nearby bin. It took two attempts, but I caught her, trapping her in a cat carrier and driving back to my family home filled with satisfaction that was not shared by my mother. Letty was young, barely fully grown and very thin. She had painful burn marks on her back that the vet said looked as if they had been made with a cigarette. Despite that, she grew into the prettiest rat I\u2019ve ever seen. Her fur was a silky coat of black and white patches, and she stayed tiny and dainty. I named her after Letty Lade, the notorious adventuress who started life in a hovel but married into the aristocracy. Rat in carrier, I caught the train back to university in Edinburgh. Two elderly ladies sat at the same table as me and smiled at the cat box. \u201cIs it a kitten?\u201d one asked, possibly after spotting a nose snuffling at the air hole. \u201cNo,\u201d I replied, perhaps too truthfully. \u201cIt\u2019s a rat I found in a bin.\u201d The ladies changed carriage. At home, with Letty in a warm, safe cage, we began a love/hate relationship that lasted the rest of her life. I loved her and she hated me \u2013 and every human she encountered. On one occasion, she bit my finger so deeply that I swear I saw a brief flash of bone, and I bought extra-thick gardening gloves for when I had no choice but to handle her. Fortunately, she quickly formed a deep bond with the other rats. She would burrow herself into the middle of the pile when they all cuddled up to sleep and would spend hours grooming them and being groomed. Letty was a very chatty rodent, constantly chirping demands at her cagemates or grinding her teeth contentedly as they lounged together in their hammock. She lived a long life for a rat, but even in old age she managed to boss around the younger rats through the sheer force of her personality. When Letty died, I cried more than for any of my friendlier rats. My bin rat is definitely the pet I will never forget.",

        "body": "In the last frenzy of major awards-giving before the Oscars, Oppenheimer has won the best theatrical feature prize at the Producers Guild of America (PGA) awards, while Past Lives dominated the Independent Spirit awards, winning best film and best director. Oppenheimer is the first Christopher Nolan-directed film to claim the prize; Nolan (and fellow producer Emma Thomas) having previously been nominated for Dunkirk, Inception, and The Dark Knight. The win puts it in pole position in the race for the best picture Oscar; the PGA, like its fellow industry associations the Directors Guild and Screen Actors Guild, has a significant crossover with the Oscar voting pool, and seven out of the last 10 winners of the PGA\u2019s theatrical film award have gone on to claim the corresponding Academy award. Succession and The Bear continued their awards run by winning the best episodic TV awards for drama and comedy respectively, with Beef winning for best limited or anthology series and Black Mirror: Beyond the Sea for best TV movie. The Independent Spirit awards, which were founded in 1984 as the Findie awards, are given to independent film-makers, with Celine Song\u2019s acclaimed Past Lives picking up the two most high-profile prizes, for best film and best director for Song. American Fiction also won two awards, for best screenplay and best lead performance for Jeffrey Wright. While the Independent Spirit awards exclude most Oscar contenders, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph continued her near-unstoppable run to the Academy awards by winning best supporting performance for The Holdovers with Dominic Sessa, who was not Oscar nominated, winning best breakthrough performer for the same film. Among other notable winners, Fremont, from British-Iranian director Babak Jalali, was awarded the John Cassavetes prize for best feature film made for under $1m.",

        "body": "The members of the WhatsApp group Smartphone Free Childhood have an unrealistic expectation if they believe that banning under-14s from possessing smartphones and trying to prevent under-16s accessing social media is a practical way of protecting them from the very real dangers that the internet can unveil (\u2018It went nuts: Thousands join UK parents calling for smartphone-free childhood\u2019, 17 February). If the first duty of any parent or guardian is to provide a safe and healthy environment for their children, then showing them how to access and use the internet safely is their responsibility. Roads are also potentially dangerous for children, but we do not ban cars \u2013 instead we spend time teaching young people the safe way to navigate through busy traffic. Having an open and honest relationship, and setting clear boundaries at home, will be far more likely to help young people understand and recognise the dangers associated with an uncensored internet than the imposition of draconian blanket bans. Making social media \u201cadults only\u201d will only make it more attractive to curious and tech-savvy children. It could also make them less likely to ask for help if exposed to any disturbing content or unwanted attention. Stuart Harrington Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset \u2022 Giving children access to a smartphone can be damaging, as we have seen so tragically with Brianna Ghey and many others. However, the wider debate about the appropriateness of smartphone access needs to be seen from all perspectives. I went through school in the smartphone era, and I saw first-hand the benefits of having access to a smartphone. I used mine to download and use a smart bus ticket, to access journalism, news and weather apps, to research topics online for assignments and to communicate with my cadet group on Facebook. There are many positive uses for a smartphone, and I don\u2019t think I could have managed without one. However, more parental controls on social media and monitoring could only be a positive thing. Even in the few years since I was in education, there has been a dramatic shift in online threats, and more control for parents should be encouraged and welcomed.

        "body": "Twenty-four in 2024 is a series on the lives, hopes and fears of 24-year-olds around the world in a year of election uncertainty, conflict and climate change. Where do you live? At the moment, I\u2019m living in Bangkok. I used to live with my friend but I graduated last year so I came back to live with my parents because I didn\u2019t have enough money. Bangkok is very good if you have a lot of money; you can do everything you want. It\u2019s easy to order everything \u2013 when you\u2019re too lazy to go out you can just open your phone and order something to eat. It\u2019s hard if you don\u2019t have a lot of money because transport is so bad. I\u2019ve just got a job, but I\u2019m waiting for the company to assign me. Wherever I go it will be outside Bangkok. What do you do? When I applied [to university] I thought: \u201cI like physics, I like mathematics, right?\u201d so I got into environmental engineering. But after I studied for four years and graduated I thought \u2026 I don\u2019t like it. So I wanted to change and find a different job , so I applied to be a management trainee. It pays a good salary and it can open up more opportunities, but you need to work hard. There are good companies that pay a lot of money for environmental engineering but the competition is high. It\u2019s a field that\u2019s hard to find work in, in Thailand. I think it\u2019s good in other countries, like the US or Canada, but other countries care about environmental issues more than Thailand. What apps do you use? Line, Instagram, Shopee and Twitter/X. Thai people use Line to send messages, send pictures, to do everything. We send stickers and emojis to be polite. We might say thank you and then \u201ca bowing bear\u201d. I have a cat so I buy everything for her on Shopee. Her name is unchi \u2013 it means \u201cpoop\u201d in Japanese, but it\u2019s cute. She\u2019s two years old. What do you listen to? I listen to Taylor Swift or Shawn Mendes or Thai songs. When I listen to English songs, sometimes I can\u2019t translate \u2013 I just think, oh good song. Then I can focus on my reading or driving. What do you eat? I eat everything except vegetables and spicy food. When I go to eat with my friends, we order tom yum kung soup, fried sea bass, chicken wings and som tum [papaya salad] \u2013 but som tum is spicy so they order one plate spicy, one plate not spicy. How do you socialise? Gossiping. If I\u2019m with a close friend I will talk about something deep, something secret that I only want to tell them. When I\u2019m with groups of friends we just drink alcohol and talk \u2013 stupid things like stories from when we were young, like old people! I like to drink beer more than whisky because beer is easy to drink \u2013 just one or two bottles, you don\u2019t need to have a mixer. We go to friends\u2019 houses to talk and eat barbecue with them, and have beer. When some of my friends want to dance maybe they go to a pub and dance together. Maybe every few months we go to another province to travel \u2013 a one-day, or two-day trip. What do you wear? Just T-shirts and jeans. I used to wear black or white colours but my mom didn\u2019t like it, she wanted me to wear pink, green, every colour. In Thailand they don\u2019t like the children to wear black or white, they say \u201cit\u2019s not lively or colourful\u201d. At university almost all of the students wear Birkenstock sandals. For girls, there\u2019s a brand called Holster, it\u2019s like a trend. Tell us about your Saturday Last Saturday I went to my aunt\u2019s bungalow hotel in Nakhon Nayok, central Thailand. Ten years ago it was busy because a lot of customers stay after spotting it while driving past. But now it\u2019s hard because a lot of young people find resorts on Facebook or Google. So I helped them to open a Facebook page. How do you relax? Watching TV like a Korean series or drama. A lot of my friends love to watch Korean series and read manga on Korean comics platform Webtoon. What do you want? I want to be rich and have a lot of money. If you have money you can do everything you want to. I could go to travel around the world, but I would need to have money first. What do you fear? I am afraid of ghosts. When I was young, I read ghost stories, but then I couldn\u2019t sleep for a month. I\u2019d need to wake my dad up for him to stay with me before I go to sleep. I\u2019ve never experienced any ghosts though, I don\u2019t want to dare them. What\u2019s next? I have a plan to study for a master\u2019s degree in Taiwan so I need to take the exam and get a high enough score to get the scholarship fee. I thought about Australia, but in Taiwan it\u2019s easier to get a full scholarship. Also, in Taiwan they speak Chinese and so I will learn another language if I go there. What does the world in 2024 look like to you? 2024 is my pee chong [a bad year according to astrology] \u2013 so I don\u2019t hope for that much. Maybe I will go to do kae chong, a tradition where we visit a temple or shrine to mitigate bad luck. Read more from the 24 in 2024 series.",

        "body": "If teachers are contributing \u00a315,000 of unpaid work to the economy each year, that\u2019s around half the salary of a new graduate teacher before tax and student loan repayments (\u2018Daylight robbery\u2019: two in five UK teachers work 26 hours for free each week, 23 February). It demonstrates that in spite of all the workload research and initiatives, and efforts by schools to write wellbeing policies and show staff that they are valued, any success in reducing workload is marginal. There\u2019s an enormous gap between the image propagated by the Department for Education\u2019s Every Lesson Shapes a Life adverts, which show smiling teachers engaged in constant life-enhancing interaction that makes a real difference to pupils\u2019 educational progress and wellbeing, and the reality of long lonely evenings spent glued to a computer away from family and friends. If the DfE doesn\u2019t want to show this downside, perhaps it should do more to cull the excessive unproductive bureaucracy that\u2019s destroying the profession. Too often, workload solutions are \u201ctips\u201d and \u201chacks\u201d \u2013 quick tactics to cut corners rather than long-term strategic solutions that address the burgeoning bureaucracy that is directly responsible for poor recruitment and retention rates. What is really needed is a full-scale job evaluation to identify the core educational activities that teachers are uniquely able to perform. Leaders should evaluate using the mantra from the DfE\u2019s 2016 Marking Policy Review Group report to ensure that all tasks are \u201cmeaningful, manageable and motivating\u201d, and cull the rest. Or the government could cough up the extra cash to pay teachers properly. Sadly, Gillian Keegan\u2019s request for unions to consider the impact of pay demands on school budgets is a clear indication that, once more, schools will be underfunded and such redress is unlikely.

        "body": "Change is coming to the land I\u2019ve come to love in 15 years living on the edge of the Castle Howard estate. Across almost 9,000 acres of mixed agriculture, forestry and parkland, the clear felling is over, as is the estate pheasant shoot \u2013 empty pens stand ready for dismantlement. The least agriculturally productive acreages are to be unyoked from cultivation \u2013 large herbivores will manage what springs from the boggy soils and there are hopes, soon, of beavers. Elsewhere, farming is switching to regenerative methods and tree cover is set to increase through a mixture of natural regeneration and planting with stock grown from seed gathered by hand \u2013 a huge effort boosted by volunteers. When I call into the estate\u2019s tree nursery, Guy Thallon, the head of natural environment, is chatting to nurserymen Josh and Henry. They\u2019ve been grading saplings for sale, but something is awry. \u201cThe rowans are all growing bent again,\u201d says Josh. \u201cThey did it last year too.\u201d He holds out a few examples. They are emphatically wonky \u2013 some executing 90-degree turns just a few inches above ground level. It\u2019s odd, Josh muses, as other species growing alongside are reaching \u2013 conventionally \u2013 skywards. Then he says that the deviants are bound for disposal. They won\u2019t fit in tree guards and no one wants bent trees anyway. Rowans have a strong appeal, aesthetically, ecologically and culturally. They are pioneers and bird magnets, at home on exposed crags in minimal soil, and thus ideally suited as urban \u201camenity trees\u201d, because a city street has much in common with a rocky mountainside. Their associated mythology and folklore is almost boundless, encompassing associations with life, fertility, fire, blood, death, transition and magic of the quickening, protective kind. I discover that the Castle Howard rowans are all bending the same way, to the south. Reaching for the light. I hard relate. When Guy offers to gift me a few trees of my choice as thanks for some small favours last year, I go back to the determinedly bent rowans, and pick four of the wonkiest I can find. They\u2019ll grow potted for now while I work out what they might have to tell me. And I persuade Josh and Henry to keep some in stock in case anyone else fancies embracing their queer and quizzical wisdom.

        "body": "Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s former boyfriend, the disgraced ex-MP Daryl Maguire, was a \u201cspecial kind of serial pest\u201d who had an \u201cemotional hold\u201d over the former state premier, a lawyer representing the New South Wales corruption watchdog has told a court. Defending the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2019s findings of corrupt conduct on the part of Berejiklian, Stephen Free SC told the court of appeal Berejiklian\u2019s \u201cvision for her future\u201d with her Liberal colleague had impacted her judgment. The court sat on Tuesday for the second day of a judicial review of the Icac findings that the former state leader engaged in corrupt conduct and breached the public trust by failing to disclose her relationship with Maguire. Berejiklian\u2019s barrister, Bret Walker SC, on Monday argued that viewing a relationship as a \u201cstanding potential for impropriety\u201d was a \u201cblack, depressing and utterly unrealistic view of human life\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He also argued there was no evidence that Berejiklian\u2019s wanting to maintain or progress her relationship with the former Wagga Wagga MP had impacted her decision-making. The claim was rebutted by Free on Tuesday. He told the court there was a \u201crational foundation\u201d for the finding and that Maguire was a \u201cspecial kind of serial pest\u201d in his lobbying of the former premier. \u201cHe was agitating for his interests in his electorate by taking advantage of a particular emotional relationship that existed only as between them,\u201d he told the court. Free said there was evidence that Maguire had an \u201cemotional hold\u201d over Berejiklian. He argued that the former premier\u2019s \u201cvision for her future\u201d, including the prospect of marriage and children with the MP, meant she had a special interest in him, \u201cwhich she obviously did not have with any other local member\u201d. Berijiklian has maintained that she did not give Maguire special treatment. Between 2016 and 2018, Berejiklian was involved in approving or supporting allocations of millions of dollars in government funds to projects in Maguire\u2019s electorate. While acknowledging others in the cabinet had also supported these projects, Free said that did not mean Berejiklian\u2019s judgment had not being affected by her relationship with the local MP. \u201cShe was influenced by not just her assessment of the merits of the proposals but a desire to maintain her relationship with Mr Maguire,\u201d Free said. Walker retorted that being influenced by someone did not amount to corruption. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t distort political decision-making to take into account the preferences and desires of those whom you admire,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the conduct of human politics by humans.\u201d Berijiklian\u2019s legal team has previously argued the findings were invalid because assistant commissioner Ruth McColl, who in charge of the probe, was no longer at the commission when they were finalised. McColl was yet to complete the report at the end of October 2022 when her term was due to expire. She was given an extension to work as a consultant until she handed her report to the three-person commission in June 2023. He also argued there were several \u201cdefects of reasoning\u201d and legal errors in the findings. Icac had initially been looking into Maguire who was also found to have engaged in serious corrupt conduct. Maguire was alleged to have used his position to conduct a business helping property developers. After Berejiklian was heard on phone taps, she was called to give evidence at Icac and admitted she had been in a \u201cclose personal relationship\u201d with Maguire for several years, which she had not disclosed to colleagues or family. Icac then investigated a number of grants she had been involved in approving for Wagga Wagga as well as her state of knowledge of Maguire\u2019s business dealings. Berejiklian has maintained she served the public interest \u201cat all times\u201d while in office. Last year, Icac found the former premier\u2019s failure to declare a personal conflict of interest in relation to funding for the Australian Clay Target Association and the Riverina Conservatorium of Music was a breach of public trust. Additionally, Icac found Berejiklian engaged in corrupt conduct by failing to report suspicions that Maguire had engaged in corrupt conduct. The hearings concluded on Tuesday afternoon and the judgment will be handed down at a later date.",

        "body": "This film hits just about every sweet spot possible: it is Icelandic and shot on black and white stock; it is a quirky road movie set in an unlikely place (Iceland); and it has a cute dog and features characters who knit. What is not love? If there had been cats and Ian McShane in a supporting role, it might have got five stars. However, writer-director Hilmar Oddsson doesn\u2019t need to pander to specific tastes because it\u2019s clear he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing with this happy-sad comedy-drama, a film that hovers on the emotional cusp between tones with consummate skill. The story unfolds in long, languid, static takes, signalling both a kind of arthouse melancholy that at the same time reads as faintly comical, setting up a frame for funny business to take place within its confines, provided the timing is just right. It most certainly is here, thanks not just to Oddsson but also his cast, led by Thr\u00f6stur Le\u00f3 Gunnarsson as Jon, a lonely farmer living in an isolated part of Iceland. In fact, the homestead is so remote, the easiest way to reach it is by boat. Jon, a middle-aged bachelor, lives with his widowed mother (Kristbj\u00f6rg Kjeld), and their perky sheepdog Bresneff (Dreki, a very good boy indeed). Jon and Mamma knit sweaters using the hearty bulky-weight lopi wool which they sell through a local cooperative. Given the story is set vaguely somewhere in the 1970s or 80s, there\u2019s no internet or TV, just cassette recordings of old news bulletins that the boatman delivers when he comes to collect the finished sweaters. One night, sour-faced Mamma dies. Jon feels obliged to honour her last wishes to dress her corpse up in her finest clothes, apply heavy makeup and drive her to the town on the other side of Iceland where she was born to be buried. Bresneff comes along for the ride, looking alert in the front seat while Mamma is strapped in the back of Jon\u2019s Ford Cortina, lookingas if she\u2019s just nodded off. She may be dead but that doesn\u2019t stop her from having conversations with Jon, criticising his life choices like the time he fell in love with a girl named Bergdis (Hera Hilmar). As the journey progresses, he imagines he sees Bergdis in every passing woman with long hair, and slowly he begins to thaw out and open up to the strangers he meets. The comic style is reminiscent of Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismaki, especially the deadpan way the film uses music. At the same time, this is very much an Icelandic film, one that celebrates the breathtaking emptiness of the landscape. Given how often the country is used to stand in for all manner of other places \u2013 imaginary (see Game of Thrones) and real (it substituted for Alaska on the recent season of True Detective) \u2013 it\u2019s nice to see Iceland play itself for a change. \u2022 Driving Mum is in UK cinemas from 1 March.",

        "body": "Germany\u2019s minister of state for culture has insisted she was only clapping the Israeli but not the Palestinian half of a film-making duo that won one of the major awards at the politically charged closing ceremony for the Berlin film festival. At Saturday night\u2019s awards event, the Palestinian film-maker Basel Adra and the Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham jointly took to the stage on Saturday to accept the best documentary prize for their joint film No Other Land, which charts the eradication of Palestinian villages in the West Bank. Adra said he struggled to celebrate his film\u2019s success while people in Gaza were \u201cbeing slaughtered and massacred\u201d, and urged Germany to cease arms exports to Israel. Speaking immediately afterwards, Abraham decried a \u201csituation of apartheid\u201d that meant that his film-making partner did not enjoy the same voting rights and freedom of movement even though they lived only 30 minutes apart. Abraham ended his acceptance speech with a call for a ceasefire in Gaza, and for a \u201cpolitical solution to end the occupation\u201d. The moment was one of several on the night in which film-makers expressed solidarity with the Palestinian cause in the conflict. The massacre perpetrated by Hamas militants on 7 October was mentioned once, in an opening statement by the Berlinale co-director, Mari\u00ebtte Rissenbeek, that called for the release of Israeli hostages. In Germany, where the government has tacked strongly behind the Israeli government since the start of the conflict, politicians were quick to condemn the event. Berlin\u2019s conservative mayor, Kai Wegner, described the speeches at the Berlinale closing ceremony as an \u201cintolerable relativisation\u201d. \u201cThe full responsibility for the deep suffering in Israel and the Gaza strip lies with Hamas,\u201d Wegner wrote on X. Even though the 10-day film festival\u2019s winners are chosen by independent juries made up of international film professionals, opposition politicians also blamed Germany\u2019s federal commissioner for culture, the Green party politician Claudia Roth, as being responsible for the comments made on-stage. A delegate for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) called for Roth\u2019s resignation, while a politician for the Free Democratic party (FDP) proposed that the film festival\u2019s state funding be withdrawn. The Berlinale, one of the big three European film festivals alongside Cannes and Venice, was financed by the German state with about \u20ac12.9m this year, roughly a third of its overall budget. Roth reacted on Monday by issuing a statement that called the statements at the gala \u201cshockingly one-sided and characterised by deep hatred of Israel\u201d, saying the lack of a mention of Hamas\u2019s terror attack was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. Footage of the awards ceremony, however, put further pressure on the minister of state: in a panoramic shot of the auditorium at the end of Adra and Abraham\u2019s acceptance speech, Roth and Wegner are clearly visible clapping their hands. In a statement on X on Monday, Roth\u2019s office tried to clarify that her applause \u201cwas directed at the Jewish-Israeli journalist and filmmaker Yuval Abraham, who spoke out in favour of a political solution and a peaceful co-existence in the region\u201d. While the conflict in the Middle East divides opinion across western societies, it is proving especially explosive in Germany\u2019s culture sector, where a strong pro-Israel consensus across the main political parties and media publishers is rubbing up against a more politically heterogenous crowd of international artists, who have been drawn to Berlin by its liberal reputation and generous cultural subsidies. In a separate development, the Berlin film festival\u2019s directors announced on Monday that it had filed criminal charges after the hacking of its Panorama section\u2019s Instagram account, which was used to post messages in support of Palestine. Under German law, at least one of the slogans posted can be classified as antisemitic and illegal. One of the images posted on Sunday showed what appeared to be Palestinian children next to the message \u201cCeasefire now \u2013 Stop the genocide in Gaza\u201d, while another read: \u201cGaza, mon amour \u2013 End the German-funded state terror\u201d. A third picture, showing a man on a horse, contained the words \u201cFree Palestine \u2013 from the river to the sea\u201d. While the \u201cFrom the river to the sea\u201d slogan predates the current war in the Middle East by several decades, it has arguably taken on a new, genocidal meaning after 7 October. Last October, the Berlin state\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office announced the phrase was subject to criminal penalties because it negates Israel\u2019s existence. \u201cThese statements do not originate from the festival and do not represent the festival\u2019s stance\u201d, the Berlin film festival said in a statement. \u201cThe posts were deleted immediately and an investigation was launched into how this incident could have occurred.\u201d",

        "body": "Why did you get into standup? I always liked performing. I did dance and piano when I was younger \u2013 to a mediocre extent \u2013 but standup was something I felt I could be really good at. Obviously if I looked back now at those performances, I\u2019d be well embarrassed but standup requires delusional confidence. I had that when I first tried it and I\u2019ve still got it now. It is also a way of connecting with people but completely, selfishly, on your own terms. Talking without interruption is great. What is the best heckle you\u2019ve had? At my first ever gig I was heckled encouragingly. I can\u2019t remember exactly what they said, something like: \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, keep going!\u201d Even though it was supportive, it\u2019s still a disruption and you wouldn\u2019t do that at the National Theatre now, would you? Last year you won \u00a3100,000 in a contest run by OnlyFans, which is not particularly known for comedy content ... It\u2019s the craziest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me! I was a contestant in OnlyFans\u2019 reality TV show where comedians did a bunch of comedy-related challenges. When I applied (at work, to the bemusement and encouragement of my colleagues) the prize was advertised as a measly \u00a350k, if you can believe. I\u2019d done standup competitions before but never for such a big cash prize. I didn\u2019t even know when I applied that it would be a reality TV show. Comedy isn\u2019t valued that highly in terms of money, especially in the UK. Culturally it\u2019s extremely valuable, but just look at the budget for a comedy TV show compared with a drama. The fact that a platform decided to place so much monetary value on something I have done for free, and that this platform also happened to specialise in subscription-based adult entertainment, was hilarious to me. What was the first thing you bought afterwards? I have a lot of money anxiety and winning the competition just made my relationship with money more complicated. I still haven\u2019t bought a stupid, extravagant, gold-plated toilet or anything like that. When I won, it took a long time to process. I think I tried to pretend like everything could still stay the same. The day after I won the money I just went into work, trying to be normal. I did take an Uber though. What\u2019s your show, Money Princess, about? My whole shtick was complaining about money and capitalism and then I won a bunch of money but I still want to complain about it. The show is about how I seem to prioritise all those things over the enjoyment of my own life, even though I think money, work and late stage capitalism are all kind of evil things. Whether I\u2019d won the money or not, I was always a Money Princess. It\u2019s a term that I\u2019m pretty sure I invented. I think it means most plainly, a girly who is aware of money, of having it, of not having it and of the nuances of wanting it. When I started this journey I was one type of Money Princess, now I\u2019m a different type. Do you have any preshow rituals? I have a playlist of songs about money that I\u2019ll have a little dance to backstage. I also do tongue-twisters and mouth exercises. Any comedy heroes? It\u2019s worrying admiring people these days because in a few years they usually turn out to be a horrible person. I love Rik Mayall \u2013 his face was just so ridiculous and I love how he wasn\u2019t afraid to be completely vulgar. And I love Richard Pryor who was just effortless, and so authentic. I should probably also mention someone who\u2019s still alive. Mindy Kaling is incredible and her ability to write flawed, lovable characters is something I\u2019ve always respected. Any bugbears from the world of comedy? It\u2019s still quite an old-fashioned industry. People make assumptions that because of your appearance your comedy will be a certain way and you can only reach certain audiences, which of course is a very limiting way to think. There\u2019s not enough representation, especially of women of colour. Things have got slightly better but there\u2019s always room for improvement and for more opportunities for me \u2013 specifically me \u2013 to get paid. Just kidding, everyone deserves their flowers. What are you excited for at the moment? I\u2019ve just moved into a new flat so I\u2019m very excited and nervous about decorating it. There are so many things you have to get that you don\u2019t even think about. I bought a loo-roll holder yesterday which was humbling yet gratifying. It\u2019s got a bit where you can put your phone on it and everything! If anyone wants to see a photo just let me know. Mary O\u2019Connell: Money Princess is at Soho theatre, London, 27-30 March",

        "body": "When Sara Kragness\u2019s partner Kadence Porter started dating a new person, they weren\u2019t breaking any rules. The couple, who live in Northampton, Massachusetts, had agreed to try polyamory \u2013 they were both free to pursue sexual, intimate relationships with other people. But when Kragness struggled to make an extracurricular connection of her own, she began to feel jealous of Porter\u2019s budding relationship. \u201cI\u2019d get snappy or grumpy right before they went on a date,\u201d Kragness said. \u201cI would pick a fight, get isolated or cold. None of that is healthy or positive.\u201d Things worsened. The couple spent less time together, avoided talking and slept in different bedrooms. At a family wedding, the bubbling drama boiled over, and the couple confronted their issues head-on. \u201cA decision had to be made: are we going to continue together, or are we going to part ways because of the poly lifestyle?\u201d Kragness said. Kragness didn\u2019t want to come off as manipulative. If Porter wished to stay poly, that was fine by her, but they would have to break up. \u201cPeople said we were done for,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the view was that when people open their relationship, it all falls apart.\u201d But after some soul-searching, Kragness and Porter decided to stick it out \u2013 and close their relationship. Polyamory (having multiple partners at once consensually) and open relationships (where couples pursue other sexual relationships but tend to stay emotionally connected to just each other) aren\u2019t anything new. The anarchist revolutionary Emma Goldman advocated for \u201cfree love\u201d in place of \u201cthat poor little State and Church-begotten weed, marriage\u201d in the 1910s, while many in the queer community practiced open relationships long before \u201cpolycule\u201d became a TikTok buzzword. But Covid changed conceptions of love and intimacy on a wider scale. This year saw the release of More, a memoir by Molly Roden Winter, in which the white, upper-class Brooklyn mom recounts juggling polyamory with parenting. Peacock\u2019s salaciously named reality show Couple to Throuple follows four pairs who, while living together in a tropical resort, mull adding a third party into the mix. (What could go wrong?) And last month, New York magazine released its \u201cpractical guide to modern polyamory\u201d, which included rules and tips on how to ethically open up a relationship. It can feel like everyone\u2019s open now \u2013 according to a recent Match study, one-third of respondents had experimented with consensual non-monogamy. But what if it doesn\u2019t work out? A failed attempt at polyamory might lead to a devastating breakup, even when some couples, like Kragness and Porter, might not be ready to call it just yet. \u201cBeing open started and ended with an agreed mutual decision: we were advocating for our personal needs, and we had a willingness to try,\u201d Kragness said. \u201cBut ultimately, we decided that we want each other in our lives, and that\u2019s not something that\u2019s possible for me if we\u2019re poly.\u201d There were awkward moments during the repair process: when Porter broke up with their other partner, it was difficult for Kragness to support them as they grieved the loss of another lover. For now, the couple \u2013 who are getting ready to celebrate their sixth anniversary \u2013 describe themselves as \u201cmonogamish\u201d. They\u2019re not actively pursuing sexual relationships with other people, but they might in the future. Deeper, emotional connections with other people remain verboten. Struggling with the \u2018Olympics of relationships\u2019 Shai Fishman is a Pennsylvania entrepreneur who also runs an online community for the polyamorous called Leveled Up Love. He says the lifestyle has helped him learn to better communicate with partners and advocate for his sexual desires \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s for everyone. Fishman often sees open relationships close, especially if a couple rushed into it or thought that trying non-monogamy might serve as a Band-Aid for pre-existing problems. \u201cI joke that polyamory is like the Olympics of relationships,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cSome people are going to struggle. There are these idealistic approaches to polyamory, and when jealousy and insecurity smacks someone in the face, they could run for the hills.\u201d In Massachusetts, the Puritan state, of all places, three cities allow more than two people to be in domestic relationships, and two of those cities have laws on the books protecting polyamorous families from discrimination. In California, Berkeley and Oakland have introduced similar bills. And in New York, the therapist Daniel Rich says half his clients are couples who engage in some sort of non-monogamous structure. When things go wrong, about half of those couples break up. \u201cThese relationships can stir up so many big feelings,\u201d Rich said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to attribute the end of a relationship to it being open. But a lot of times, it really ends because of issues that were already present in the relationship, such as a lack of communication or trust.\u201d He says the couples who do tough it out can have a long road of rebuilding after closing their relationships back up. At first, Jeannie, a 53-year-old administrative worker from New York, enjoyed opening her marriage. She\u2019d never been with people other than her husband, whom she\u2019s known since high school and had gone through long dry spells with. The sex drought was so prominent, in fact, that Jeannie once spoke to the women\u2019s magazine Self for an article about not having enough sex. (Jeannie is a pseudonym.) Opening up the marriage felt like the \u201ccapstone\u201d of a process during which Jeannie became more comfortable with her sexuality. She took pole dancing lessons and courses on women\u2019s empowerment. One night in 2018, Jeannie kissed someone who wasn\u2019t her husband at a party; the couple calls that date their \u201cpolyversary\u201d. Jeannie thought this new period of self-discovery and erotic exploration was fun: \u201cI went on tons of dates, went to parties, and met lots of people.\u201d But her husband wasn\u2019t as successful and found dating hard. That was, until he met someone he really liked \u2013 and eventually, loved. Gradually, the tables turned on Jeannie. \u201cI never expected that to happen,\u201d she said. Her one night stands began to feel like a \u201crevolving door\u201d of lovers who weren\u2019t satisfying. Meanwhile, her husband was falling deeper in love with his new girlfriend. \u201cIs she another soulmate?\u201d Jeannie wondered. \u201cIt was jarring to my reality, and I didn\u2019t know where I fit.\u201d Things came to a head during the fall of 2020: \u201cI told my husband that if he was poly by nature and needed that in his life, that was OK, but I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Jeannie said. They agreed to give their closed marriage another shot by rebuilding their relationship and clarifying their desires. \u201cWe did all of the things: couples therapy, individual therapy, medicine journeys,\u201d Jeannie said. It wasn\u2019t easy, and there was collateral damage. Jeannie\u2019s husband harbored resentment for having to break up with his girlfriend, whom he never intended to hurt; she was devastated. But he and Jeannie still made a point to commit. \u201cWe had breakfast together every day and learned how to be better communicators,\u201d Jeannie said. They also wrote up a \u201crelationship agreement\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s 20 pages long, with an appendix \u2013 that breaks down their priorities as a couple, what\u2019s OK to do, and what\u2019s not. After a few years closed, Jeannie and her husband opened up again with that agreement in mind. No regrets about trying polyamory Sometimes, relationships start out polyamorous. Such was the case with Rome, a 24-year-old bookseller from New Mexico who has dated his partner Andi for about a year. For the first six months, they agreed to be open. Both wanted to explore relationship anarchy, an ethos that prioritizes autonomy and community over monogamy\u2019s rules for romance. The couple scheduled monthly \u201ccheck-ins\u201d to talk about their feelings and discuss how things were going. (Rome and Andi asked that their last names not be used.) \u201cWe had a rule where we\u2019d only tell each other what we needed to know: for example, we would only tell each other about a new relationship if we thought it was going to be an ongoing thing,\u201d Rome explained. There were times when they\u2019d accidentally reveal \u201ctoo much\u201d to each other: \u201cI was at a concert with someone else, and I told my partner how we were having a really great time, and they said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear about that,\u2019\u201d Rome recalled. For his part, Rome found himself feeling \u201con edge\u201d when he thought about Andi going out with other people. Andi, who is 27 and works as a graduate teaching associate, said they had grown exhausted with the pace of dating outside of a relationship. \u201cThe thought of having the door open for romantic connections grew less of a priority, given my energy and emotional capacity,\u201d they said. Still, when Andi thought about having the \u201clet\u2019s close up\u201d conversation, they felt anxious. \u201cWe met on a dating app that\u2019s used by non-monogamous folks, and Rome reads a lot about polyamory and its benefits. I had this fear that my asking for monogamy might be read as a control or coercion thing. I worried that this person I cared about so much would think that I was trying to limit the meaningful connections he can have for other people.\u201d But there were no tears or big, blowout arguments. In fact, the scene could have been straight out of a romcom: during one of their check-ins, Andi told Rome they weren\u2019t seeing anyone. Rome told them he wasn\u2019t either. They came to the conclusion that it should stay that way. None of the couples who spoke to the Guardian said they regretted being open, or believed monogamy to be the only way to date. It\u2019s just what is best for them at this time. \u201cSociety hands us these boxes and says, \u2018These are the only options,\u2019 and certain compulsory behaviors are so ingrained in our society,\u201d Rome said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s OK to change your mind.\u201d",

        "body": "The hardest part of this job is writing about drama. How do you get revved up for drama? \u201cThey said things in the right way. No jokes. Everyone was delivering their lines very earnestly. And then drama happened.\u201d Every time a big drama project rolls around I worry: what can I say about the costume choices, the music, the direction? Because the acting in these things is always very pure, good, capital-A acting, and then never really gives me a critical in. It\u2019s just: it\u2019s drama. Mary &amp; George (5 March, 9pm, Sky Atlantic) then, which is a drama. The costumes are nice, the music is genuinely fantastic, the direction is gorgeous. But actually, something texturally interesting about Mary &amp; George captured me from the off, and that\u2019s it now. I get what you lot are always on about. Drama is good, finally, and I see why it always ends up winning awards. The brief of Mary &amp; George is so good: Julianne Moore plays Mary Villiers, a famously scheming real-life Countess of Buckingham, who is jagging around merry olde England in the early 1600s, doing a low, blunt English accent and trying to hustle her second-born son, George (played cheekboningly well by Red, White &amp; Royal Blue\u2019s Nicholas Galitzine). Don\u2019t you want to watch Julianne Moore use her gorgeous adult son as a sexy royal pawn? You do, and I do too, and we\u2019re right to. The two leads are great \u2013 Galitzine\u2019s George is moping and moaning and wet and soft, until a formative trip to France turns him into a sexy little harlot, and Moore is, well, Moore: scheming and manipulative and charming, always running her eyes from left to right as she tries to calculate the next shrewd social chess move, inscrutable. They are both bastards, basically, but doing it in such a fun knowing way that it\u2019s dynamising to watch. \u201cKnowing\u201d is the operative word here: it would be easy to label a show like this as \u201ccamp\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite right. There is a lot of enjoyable historical queerness, of course \u2013 Villiers is constantly trying to get her son in front of the wandering eye of King James I (a joyously lewd Tony Curran), there\u2019s a lot of sucking the juices of a fresh ripe fruit off a thumb, a lot of suggestive dangly gold earrings and everyone is constantly eating their dinner in a brothel \u2013 but despite that, the sex in Mary &amp; George is almost always power over lust, and is played as such. Mary &amp; George pulsates with \u201cromp\u201d energy, and it would be easy to lean into that, but what everyone is doing here is far more interesting: Laurie Davidson\u2019s Robert Carr is screen-grabbingly villainous, Niamh Algar is full of bolshie intrigue, Sean Gilder\u2019s Sir Thomas Compton a perfect TV grump. I am a sucker for a period-ish drama where everyone, nevertheless, talks like they\u2019re normal (last year\u2019s The Gallows Pole and Mary &amp; George are comparable in that regard, though with a valley-sized class divide between them), and this lands right in the sweet spot: a complete absence of \u201cyes my Lord, no my Lord\u201d, and instead wicked little characters t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eateing behind velvet curtains. Two more compliments before I let you go off and try to figure out how to make the Sky box series-link this then get frustrated and give up: there are a couple of directorial choices that make Mary &amp; George feel fresh and new and interesting. One of them is \u2013 and this is going to blow your mind \u2013 no drone shots. Perhaps period productions in recent years have suffered from a trend of \u201cover-epic-ing\u201d (too many sweeping camera angles, too many catapults flinging rocks into the mist: the same way sci-fi sometimes feels like two computers being a bit mad at each other) but M&amp;G feels very low-down and real as a result. You actually see real human faces move, you see people scheme and argue over banquets, you hear the crackle of the fire. That\u2019s good. And, also: once an episode, there\u2019s a crucial scene \u2013 a moment of humiliation, or a great win, or some huge, well, drama \u2013 that is wound down to slow-motion, all dialogue and audio cut out of it, an epic orchestral tune playing behind it. The effect is like looking at a many-layered renaissance painting \u2013 almost still but with lots of spinning wheels of intrigue \u2013 and are, mainly because Galitzine is so often in the middle of them, fantastic to look at. What a treat, m\u2019lord! What a little dramatic treat! Mary &amp; George is released in the UK and Australia on 5 March and Starz in the US on 5 April.",

        "body": "Taking an unauthorised family holiday is about to get more expensive, with the government announcing that fines for children in England missing school are to rise by 33%. The education secretary, Gillian Keegan, is to overhaul the way local authorities fine parents for unauthorised school absences by bringing penalties \u201cunder a national framework to help tackle inconsistencies\u201d. The Department for Education said that fines \u201cmust be considered if a child misses five days of school for unauthorised absence\u201d, with local authorities currently having wide variation over whether they levy fines. Under the new rules, the initial penalty notices will be raised from \u00a360 to \u00a380, if paid within 21 days. Those who delay payment will have fines raised from \u00a3120 to \u00a3160. Schools\u2019 daily registers will also be shared online with the DfE and local authorities, as part of the government\u2019s drive to improve attendance from its post-Covid slump. Keegan said: \u201cOur fantastic schools and teachers unlock children\u2019s imagination, potential and social skills, which is why improving attendance is my number one priority. \u201cToday we are taking that next step to further boost attendance and I want to thank those who are working with us, including teachers and heads.\u201d Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, stressed that most fines were applied to children taken on holidays during term time, while higher absences were often the result of serious issues such as mental health problems. Barton said: \u201cThere is a wider issue about absence relating to the growing number of children who suffer from anxiety, families who are struggling to cope, and disengagement with education, which schools are endeavouring to address by working with families and pupils to improve their attendance rather than using fines. \u201cSchools need more help from the government in this work, both in terms of the funding they receive and investment in local social care, attendance and mental health services. \u201cEducation has become an unofficial fourth emergency service, picking up the pieces for a decade-long erosion of support services. This cannot go on.\u201d In 2022-23, out of a total 399,000 penalty notices, a record 350,000 parents in England were fined for taking their children out of school for unauthorised holidays. The total was 20% higher than in 2018-19, the last full school year before the pandemic. Labour\u2019s Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: \u201cThe Conservatives are only just waking up to the damage of persistent absence that has reached historic levels on their watch, but their answer addresses the symptoms of absence, not the causes. \u201cPersistent absence was rising long before the pandemic, the result of growing unaddressed mental ill health, the impact of years of economic decline hitting family finances and a breakdown of trust between schools and families.\u201d",

        "body": "The New South Wales government has rejected industry criticism its approvals of renewable energy projects lag other states, saying planning had finalised support for 18 significant wind, solar and battery projects in 2023. The defence came as federal, state and territory energy ministers gather in Canberra for the first meeting of 2024 on Friday. Speeding up the rollout of renewable energy along with an updated national hydrogen strategy are understood to be on the agenda. In data released to Guardian Australia, the Minns government said the 18 projects given support last year would generate enough clean energy to power more than 1.5m homes with a combined capacity of 7.6 gigawatts of generation and storage. More than 3,000 jobs would also result during construction and operation of those projects, with 8.3m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions avoided each year. These include Virya Energy\u2019s proposed 1.5GW Yanco Delta windfarm with 208 turbines in the Riverina region, which would be Australia\u2019s largest. \u201cThese approvals represent the NSW government\u2019s commitment to accelerate the transition to renewables so households and businesses have reliable access to clean and affordable electricity,\u201d said the energy minister, Penny Sharpe. \u201cNSW is now about halfway towards our 2030 renewable generation target, and over a quarter of the way there on our long-duration storage target.\u201d The pace of renewable energy\u2019s introduction will feature prominently at Friday\u2019s energy ministers gathering. A capacity investment scheme, proposed by the Albanese government last November, will be among the agenda items, Guardian Australia understands. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Setting national standards for so-called distributed energy resources and customer energy resources to support the growing spread of rooftop solar panels and home batteries will also be discussed. Also on the agenda will be details of an updated national hydrogen strategy. Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, Victoria\u2019s energy minister, will also brief counterparts about this month\u2019s severe storms that knocked out a key transmission line and blew over power poles, cutting off power to about half a million homes. The event underscored the need for greater resilience of electricity networks, an issue Victoria had pressed in meetings last year. A spokesperson for the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, declined to comment ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting. The reliability of the power grid may again be tested later on Thursday. An actual so-called level one lack of reserve event was reported in NSW by the market operator as temperatures in parts of Sydney reached 40C in a late-summer heatwave, pushing up electricity demand. Renewable investors had singled out NSW as the state with some of the highest hurdles to clear to get projects to completion. Late last year, the state\u2019s planning department surprised some in the industry with a map that appeared to discourage windfarms, even from parts of its designated renewable energy zones. The map was later revised. The Clean Energy Investment Group also recently released a report calling for \u201cgreater approval and timing certainty for clean energy projects\u201d. It said windfarms in NSW were taking an average 3,488 days for approval \u2013 or almost 10 years \u2013 with solar farms taking 705 days. Battery projects needed 540 days, while hydro and transmission projects were taking 492 days on average. Simon Corbell, the group\u2019s chief executive, said on Thursday he \u201cstrongly\u201d welcomed the finalising of planning assessments, particularly for the Yanco Delta windfarm. \u201cHowever, the total number of wind projects approved remains low, compared to solar and battery storage,\u201d Corbell said. \u201cOnshore wind energy is the lowest cost form of new utility scale generation available today and will play a central role as thermal coal continues to exit the system.\u201d Corbell\u2019s group wants to see the NSW government further expedite planning assessment in the draft energy assessment guidelines currently under consideration. Of particular concern are changes to the proposed visual amenity assessment criteria for wind projects, he said. Nicholas Aberle, a Clean Energy Council director, said NSW had had \u201ca patchy few years in terms of project approvals, especially wind farms and has historically been much slower than other states\u201d. \u201cThe approvals in the last few months have been a welcome change, but this pace needs to be maintained,\u201d Aberle said. \u201cThe NSW government\u2019s current review of planning guidelines for wind farms needs to deliver a framework that is fit for the purpose of ensuring renewable energy projects are built at the pace needed to replace ageing coal power stations and to reduce climate emissions.\u201d Paul Scully, NSW\u2019s planning minister, said renewable energy projects would \u201chelp deliver clean and affordable energy to NSW residents while injecting millions of dollars into regional economies and creating hundreds of new jobs\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with industry and impacted communities to strike the right balance between supporting renewable energy projects and responsible development,\u201d Scully said.",

        "body": "I have a severely disabled friend. He has previously been sectioned and has not left his flat since October 2023. He only leaves his bed to cook small meals, and to use the bathroom. Among other ailments is a brittle bone condition which has caused him to suffer three fractured hips. He takes powerful medication, and relies on benefits to live. Recently, I discovered that he is paying Virgin Media between \u00a3144 and \u00a3175 a month for his TV broadband/landline package. He does watch Sky TV, Netflix and use his phone, but he has no need for Sky Sports which is included in his bill. I can\u2019t help believing that his bill could be substantially reduced. Can you help? AF, Hertfordshire These cases are very difficult because we never know what the person agreed to when they took out the contract. I agree that on the face of it, though, \u00a3175 a month is a crazy sum to be paying. I asked Virgin Media to contact the customer, and having done so it has concluded that he is on the best bundle for his needs \u2013 albeit still at a whopping \u00a3120 a month. This includes Premium Netflix which is worth \u00a317.99 if bought separately, and Sky Sports that he doesn\u2019t need, but wouldn\u2019t save any money by ditching. That said, I think you could help him bring this bill down significantly by establishing which channels he actually watches, and then switching to the Sky home entertainment package that fits his needs.

        "body": "In 2015, Philadelphia\u2019s Sheer Mag released their second EP in collaboration with a tiny Brooklyn punk label. Its lead track, Fan the Flames, was one of those songs that just stops you in your tracks. It seemed to be rooted in music that had far less to do with punk than the mainstream hard rock that predominated when punk first reared its head: there was Thin Lizzy and quite possibly some Lynyrd Skynyrd in its unhurried sound, while lead guitarist Kyle Seely was audibly engaged in the kind of playing that would once have been approvingly referred to as \u201claying down\u201d some \u201ctasty licks\u201d. But the sound was lo-fi and absolutely everything was caked in distortion, including the voice of Tina Halladay, a potent, soulful wail that, on closer inspection, was delivering a call-to-arms against unscrupulous landlords and gentrification. Between the classic rock references, the noise, the dextrous musicianship, the vocal delivery and the righteously pissed-off lyrics lurked the exciting sense that this was a band who weren\u2019t quite like anyone else around at the moment, amplified by the fact that Sheer Mag didn\u2019t do social media, or grant interviews to the press. Since then, Sheer Mag have eased up on their media blackout and released two full-length albums that honed the sound found on Fan the Flames: retro-glancing rock of the hard \u2013 and, occasionally, soft \u2013 variety, noisy punk/garage aesthetics, political lyrics, killer guitar playing and Halladay\u2019s equally killer voice. Both 2017\u2019s Need to Feel Your Love and 2019\u2019s A Distant Call come highly recommended \u2013 if you\u2019re in the market for a vaguely New Wave of British Heavy Metal-influenced call for armed socialist revolution, hasten to the latter album\u2019s Chopping Block \u2013 but Playing Favorites is a noticeably different beast. For one thing, it started life as a disco EP \u2013 an attempt, the band have suggested, to shake off personal difficulties through euphoric music. These origins are still intermittently audible on Playing Favorites, both in lyrics that deal with emotional upheaval \u2013 not least the death of Halladay\u2019s abusive father \u2013 and in its sound. You hear disco during the breezy All Lined Up and the episodic Mechanical Garden, which slips from tough powerpop to orchestral interlude to intricate funk, complete with blazing guitar solo courtesy of Mdou Moctar. Moonstruck, meanwhile, dramatically diverts from its slide guitar-strafed country rock intro and heads euphorically towards the dancefloor, bearing a freewheeling melody that has a hint of the Jackson 5\u2019s I Want You Back in its DNA. But the music here clearly outgrew its original remit, not least to include songs that fit Halladay\u2019s description of the band\u2019s USP \u2013 \u201cnobody [else] seems to write straight-up rock bangers any more\u201d \u2013 although they\u2019re wont to leave you wondering whether \u201cstraight-up\u201d isn\u2019t a knowingly reductive view of what Sheer Mag do. Eat It and Beat It might be rooted in old-fashioned, blue-collar heartlands American rock, but it arrives stripped of that genre\u2019s swaggering machismo, replaced with simmering anger at the state of things. Essentially a rallying call for a new generation of rock bands, it still seems to keep casting its eyes towards societal iniquities: \u201cDon\u2019t bother with the referee, it\u2019s all going back to the company.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that isn\u2019t entirely without historical precedent (tellingly, when once asked to pick the song they wished they had written, Halladay and Matt Palmer picked Judas Priest\u2019s Breaking the Law, which beneath its potent riffs and preposterous video, is a song mired in fury about unemployment in early 80s Britain), but it still sounds fresh and vital. So do the moments on Playing Favorites where Sheer Mag sound like they\u2019re expanding outwards, either tonally \u2013 there appears to be a celeste on Tea on the Kettle; a tumbling acoustic guitar figure introduces the title track \u2013 or in leaning more towards pop. Everything is still lightly battered in distortion, as though the band were still recording on a cheap 8-track tape in a bedroom, but the snarl in Halladay\u2019s voice is dialled back, the melodies on Golden Hour and closer When You Get Back ring a little more sweetly than in the past. The latter song is a triumph \u2013 dressed with vocal harmonies, the Thin Lizzy-ish twin guitars chiming joyously \u2013 but in truth, everything here is done really well. There\u2019s doubtless someone ready to grouse about the moments that take a softer approach, but you struggle to see that argument gaining a lot of traction. Even at its most melodious, Playing Favorites still sounds fierce and raw, an object lesson in altering your sound without losing your essence. This week Alexis listened to Musclecars \u2013 Ha Ya!

        "body": "I have an old friend from another city \u2013 who is struggling to find work and just got evicted from her home \u2013 staying with my family. Part of her struggle to find her own place (or even a homeless shelter in her area) is that many landlords don\u2019t accept pets and she has a cat. She\u2019s basically starting her life over. Her skills are minimal (no degrees or specialised training), no car, and she just left a big city for the small town that we live in. She and I both know that it will be months upon months of living with us. She has spent the last five years caring for her mother, who had dementia. As much as I\u2019m humbled and honoured to give her a leg up, I\u2019m terrified that she will be living with us for a long time. My focus on myself and my own goals are fragmented at this point, because I\u2019m trying to help her out, too. She\u2019s also afraid of doing anything alone. I\u2019m trying to think of realistic boundaries/timelines to set with her; but in all reality she may not have her ducks in a row. I will not allow her to be homeless; but my sanity may be on the line if she\u2019s going to be my permanent roommate. Any advice? Eleanor says: You\u2019re doing a good thing. It sounds like your friend fell hard and bit the asphalt \u2013 mourning a parent, losing years of possible career time to caretaking, and now without a home. In a culture of \u201cyou don\u2019t owe anyone anything\u201d, you\u2019re doing a good thing. But the fact something is good to do doesn\u2019t necessarily make it easy \u2013 total compliance with morality would probably make life worse and leave you without any bits of sweetness or solitude. And boundaries are going to be important \u2013 you don\u2019t want to wind up like the giving tree, sawing off your own limbs so someone else has a place to sit. How to balance the imperative for kindness with the need to protect your own sanity? I think one place to start is recruiting as much help as you can to improve her situation. Precarious housing is a broader category than people think. It includes couchsurfers and people who\u2019ve been evicted and people staying with friends or family in just the way that your friend is. If your own ingenuity or industry could fix the problems that put people in these situations, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone in them any more. There are professionals and groups who have more experience than either of you in getting people back to more permanent housing. If you can encourage her to grab hold of as much qualified help as possible, that will simultaneously make it more likely that she finds a solution, and less likely that finding that solution will devour all your time and focus. It can be really easy for people to put off engaging this kind of help \u2013 out of shame, social awkwardness or the sense that it\u2019s only for people in worse positions. If you can frame it as a kindness to you for her to seek this kind of help, it might overcome those feelings. It might also help to be specific about what\u2019s putting your sanity on the line. If you can name exactly what you need and aren\u2019t getting, it\u2019s easier to find ways to provide it, even in slightly compromised ways. If it\u2019s about solitude \u2013 if you\u2019re like me and without enough alone time your brain goes like an old TV tuned to nothing, just static and bands of nonsense colours \u2013 you could try to find slivers of alone time even while she\u2019s living with you. You could ask for X many nights to yourself, and make them predictable and recurring, so you can plan and look forward to them. Or if it\u2019s about feeling overwhelmed with responsibility for another person\u2019s future, you could work on small ways to call your focus back. Mark periods of the day off as times when you do not think about this, or practice directing her (and you) to professionals instead. One final thing would be to make sure you keep careful track of the common ground between you. You don\u2019t want to be thinking \u201cI wonder how long until she finds a place to stay\u201d while she\u2019s thinking \u201cthank heavens I\u2019ve found a place to stay\u201d. Try to make sure that you\u2019re each continuously upfront about what the other expects. If it comes to it, and you feel like you\u2019ve ended up with too-porous boundaries, try to remember the fortune-cookie wisdom: would you rather be non-confrontational or treated fairly? This is a really good thing you\u2019re doing. Not many people put their money (or their house) where their mouth is in this way. Just try to make sure it doesn\u2019t obscure her longer-term path. *** Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

        "body": "People regularly invoke your name as someone they\u2019d like to join them at the perfect dinner party. Are you such a fantastic guest? hhhhssss When people say that, I usually reply: \u201cAh, you haven\u2019t seen me eat.\u201d It\u2019s a very charming thing to hear, a way people get, I guess, to list qualities of their heroes or people they admire and imagine very kindly that I\u2019m a good speaker or that I\u2019m a wit of some sort, and hope I\u2019m friendly. The list usually includes Winston Churchill and Oscar Wilde and I always feel extremely unworthy, but I don\u2019t want to bore anybody with, you know, the usual British modesty ritual. I\u2019ll just say that it\u2019s a great honour and I certainly try when I\u2019m at dinner parties. Although, have you noticed post Covid, there seem to be fewer of them? Or perhaps it\u2019s just that people have stopped inviting me. \u201cIf nothing else works, a total pig-headed unwillingness to look facts in the face will see us through.\u201d Was Melchett the godfather of Brexit? Shauny79 It\u2019s a brilliant observation by whoever put that question that the speech of Melchett\u2019s, which I loved saying, does so precisely fit the attitude to Brexit: \u201cA total pig-headed unwillingness to look facts in the face.\u201d Playing Melchett was one of the great joys of my life. To be let loose on such powerful eccentricity and unpredictable barking madness is a great treat for any actor. What is your achilles heel in trivia quizzes? vastariner Oh, popular culture and pop generally. I wouldn\u2019t know one Kardashian from another. I know they exist, and I know most of their names begin with K, but I\u2019m not being fake ignorant, I genuinely just don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t see why I should go to Wikipedia and read up on the history of the Kardashian family. I know it\u2019s a phenomenon. And all phenomena are worthy of interest in the human story, I suppose. But there isn\u2019t room for everything. So I wouldn\u2019t be good on K-pop or Girls Aloud or indie or hip-hop. My husband is a great hip-hop fan and has taught me to love and respect Kendrick Lamar. Eminem has genuine poet skills and is quite exciting to listen to, although I wouldn\u2019t put it on as I\u2019m going for a drive, I have to confess. Did you really win a large pile of Turkish Delight for being the brainiest boy at Cambridge University and knowing all the biggest words, while Hugh Laurie won a small truck for having the boggliest eyes in college (as depicted in the Viz comic strip Fry\u2019s Turkish Delight)? TopTramp Someone did send me a scan of it, and I was of course simultaneously thrilled, horrified and deeply honoured to be in the pages of that sensational magazine. If prizes were being given for the boggliest eyes, surely Hugh would have won. I don\u2019t remember anyone else at the university with bogglier. Would I have been the brainiest boy at Cambridge University? The thing is, when you go to a place like Cambridge, the first person you\u2019d meet is someone who speaks seven languages, then you turn around and there\u2019s a person who\u2019s doing binomials and polynomials in their head. I can understand all the hatred and contempt for Oxbridge and these kinds of great British institutions that were once so lauded and praised. How are you coping with getting old? Bustersmyboss Do you know what? I rather like it. Yes, there are leaks. Leaks and creaks. And, of course, being a baby boomer, it\u2019s very interesting because we are the demographic leaders and have been since the moment we were born, with sugary cereals and sweets advertised to us on television. Then as we became slightly older, we became yuppies. We were the spending generation. Now, as baby boomers, you start getting advertisements for people completely mysteriously making tomato sandwiches in conservatories talking to the camera about their insurance and funeral plans, stepping out of baths, lifting themselves out of electric armchairs, mobility scooters and incontinence pads. There are more adverts for us now than there are for children. I was never cute, I\u2019ve got better looking as I\u2019ve got older. Not that I\u2019m good looking, but it suits me better than youth did when I was a bit awkward, gawky and looked older than my age. So that was confusing and weird. Now I\u2019ve sort of settled into my mid-60s and they seem to suit me pretty well. If you\u2019re so clever, why can\u2019t you invent time travel or a cure for cancer? TurangaLeela2 and TopTramp Who says that I haven\u2019t, didn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, aren\u2019t at this very moment? No, you\u2019re right. Good heavens, I wish I were that clever. There are brands of clever. There\u2019s smart quick. You look at someone like Lee Mack and you think: \u201cHow does a brain operate that fast?\u201d You get other people who have a cleverness of verbal facility and talk about philosophy, history and poetry all in one go. And then there are others who have a kind of intelligence that\u2019s a wisdom, an insight into human behaviour that\u2019s nothing to do with education. How to cope with life: you don\u2019t need education for that. People use the great phrase: \u201cCan\u2019t sit the right way on a toilet seat\u201d to mean doesn\u2019t have any common sense. But so there are so many wildly different kinds of intelligence. I\u2019m aware that I have verbal facility and that I have a good memory and I\u2019m very pleased about those things. If only they helped in things like a cure for cancer. What would have happened if it was Laurie and Fry and your career had taken the path of Hugh\u2019s and him yours? TurangaLeela2 I think if I had his physical talents for sport: tennis, cricket, football, rowing \u2026 I can\u2019t even dive into a swimming pool. If I could sing and play an instrument, I would sit all day at the piano. But it\u2019s a bit like a flatfooted platypus looking up at an eagle and saying: \u201cIf I could fly, I would do this. I would do that.\u201d Hugh\u2019s life is brilliant and he\u2019s earned it and the respect and affection in which people hold him is so fully deserved. He\u2019s a wonderful, wise, kind, good, funny, clever man, and brilliantly talented. In many ways, his life is much more admirable and enviable than mine. And yet I wouldn\u2019t swap. It loops back to your question about old age. One of the things you come to terms with is that your life is your life, and all the terrible mistakes, wrong terms, regrets and I wishes and why didn\u2019t I? You do actually think: \u201cWell, it was my life and I led it, and I wouldn\u2019t really have it any other way.\u201d \u2022 The Inventor is in Vue cinemas from 8 March",

        "body": "Just last night, before I woke up to the news that comedy legend Richard Lewis has passed away at 76, I was watching him duke it out with Larry David. There is a very funny scene in the new season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, a gloriously volcanic t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate on a golf course where the two men \u2013 playing heightened versions of themselves \u2013 start bickering, hardly for the first time in the show\u2019s 12 seasons. \u201cI\u2019m leaving you in my will \u2013 I\u2019m tweaking it and you\u2019re in it,\u201d Lewis snaps, triggering the following vein-bulging exchange: David: If bequeathed, I will not accept! Lewis: Well, I\u2019m bequeathing. David: Well, I\u2019m not accepting! Lewis: Well, you have to accept! David: Don\u2019t give it to me! Lewis: Don\u2019t hurt my feelings! David: I\u2019m not gonna keep a penny of it! Lewis: You\u2019re hurting me! David: Thank you, but I don\u2019t want it! Lewis: I\u2019m giving it to you anyway, pal! David: Oh my god, fuck you! This absurd moment perfectly encapsulates how well these two old friends worked together. \u201cRichard and I were born three days apart in the same hospital and for most of my life he\u2019s been like a brother to me,\u201d David said after Lewis\u2019s death was announced. You can feel the very real affection between these guys, though neither would stand for schmaltz. It is why any Curb fan can watch them argue ad infinitum \u2013 and also because a fight over their relationship\u2019s \u201cobligation imbalance\u201d could somehow become a discussion of the linguistic similarities between Mussolini, the dictator and Mucinex, the cold and flu medicine. Lewis\u2019s schtick was a slightly calmer counter to David\u2019s, but always acerbic and always ready to pick and needle. Both on camera and in real life, he was almost always dressed in all black \u2013 in Curb he was sometimes overdressed in black, one vaguely military-looking outfit prompting David to ask him: \u201cAre you vying for the title of the most pretentious man in the world?\u201d And on and on we go. Watching these guys go to town on each other never gets old. So often when Lewis performed, you can see a cheeky, impish gleam in those big eyes: he was having a great time. Much of his career was in standup comedy, positioning the bulk of his work in live and ephemeral art as \u201cthe Prince of Pain\u201d, as well clocking up a whopping 48 appearances on Late Night with David Letterman. His film credits include Prince John in 1993\u2019s Robin Hood: Men in Tights, directed by Mel Brooks who once said that Lewis \u201cmay just be the Franz Kafka of modern-day comedy\u201d. Lewis brings a hilariously manic, bulging-eyed energy to the role, such as when he insists that the Sheriff of Rottingham must deliver some bad news \u201cin a good way\u201d (then, of course, admonishes him for making light of a terrible situation). Lewis also starred alongside Jamie Lee Curtis in the well-loved late 80s sitcom Anything But Love, bringing the funnies as neurotic journalist Marty Gold. In the opening scene we see him board a flight while desperately trying to \u201cforget the fact that five million pounds of metal is slightly heavier than air\u201d. In no time he\u2019s engaged in a spritzy banter with Hannah Miller, played by Curtis, another of Lewis\u2019s great conversational sparring partners. It was 30 years before his final turn in Curb, but even then you could clearly see Lewis was enjoying himself, loving the banter and relishing the comedy, but never winking too hard at the audience. He will be missed.",

        "body": "I was working as a documentary producer in New York when I stumbled upon a rooftop farm and realised that growing food was the work for me. (Though I assure you there are less ridiculous ways to get started with edible plants.) After my epiphany brought me back to London, I had to figure out how to grow without a garden (as even my windowsills were too narrow for a window box), so I spent my spare time volunteering in community gardens and city farms, starting to learn what it takes to sow, grow and harvest. I found that all the growers I lent a hand to would repay my efforts by sharing with me their insight and experience as we harvested, weeded and mulched together. Whether it\u2019s someone up the street whose crops catch your eye or your allotment neighbour with an enviable plot, it\u2019s especially useful to get advice from nearby gardeners who can tell you what does \u2013 and doesn\u2019t \u2013 do well where you are. Despite having a horticultural qualification now, I truly believe the most enriching kind of learning I\u2019ve experienced has been by the side of passionate plant people. Volunteering, though, is the preserve of those with the privilege of free time, which so many of us don\u2019t have enough of. When I was too busy working to volunteer, I\u2019d be making my way through the secondhand gardening books I\u2019d collected from charity shops. While there are new books about growing released every year, most old ones contain the same information and are, of course, more affordable. I\u2019d take an abundance of notes and then return the book to the charity shop for the next budding grower to find. I got started in growing before lots of gardeners had taken to demonstrating their skills on social media. If there had been how-to videos and garden tours on my phone, that\u2019s how I would have be learning. So if you\u2019re also more of a visual learner, I recommend that you check out Rekha Mistry and Huw Richards (instagram.com/huwsgarden). Both offer great practical advice that takes you through the process of cultivating all sort of plants destined to end up on your plate. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a sunny patch to call your own but feel a bit daunted by the prospect of growing into soil, consider starting with containers (I really like fabric grow bags and use plenty of them every season). The first book I wrote was about growing edible crops in containers, as this is a great way to try your hand at raising crops for the first time, plus it means you can still grow stuff if your outside space is paved over or rented.",

        "body": "Late-night hosts talk the supreme court endorsing Donald Trump\u2019s delay tactics, Trump\u2019s visit to the border and how he is going to pay his $454m civil fraud penalty. Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert celebrated 29 February, AKA Leap Day, on Thursday\u2019s Late Show \u2013 \u201cthat one magical day you can do anything you want because no laws apply, evidently, according to the supreme court\u201d. He referred to the court\u2019s decision to hear Trump\u2019s immunity claim, further delaying his January 6 trial \u201cin the landmark case of People v Do Laws Matter?\u201d joked Colbert. \u201cSeriously, what is going on?! Justice deferred is justice gutted like a fish and thrown in the river for chum!\u201d The justices scheduled arguments for the week of 22 April and said proceedings in the trial court would remain frozen until then. \u201cThat makes it a total of 19 weeks of delays,\u201d Colbert explained. \u201cThese proceedings have been frozen for so long, they legally count as children in Alabama.\u201d The decision comes after an appeals court ruled unanimously against Trump\u2019s claim that presidents have total immunity from prosecution, including if they ordered the assassination of a political rival. Though arguments will be heard in April, decisions would not be released until June, which would push the trial to late September or October, in the heart of the election. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible news for democracy, but fantastic news for television,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cAll of the plotlines will come together at once for the thrilling conclusion of \u2026 America.\u201d Colbert then turned serious, noting recent polls indicating that only 18% of Americans have confidence in the court. \u201cThe supreme court gains all of its legitimacy and all of its power from public approval,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an army or a police force or, apparently, an HR department. \u201cThey have to rely on moral authority. But they have abdicated that moral authority,\u201d which is why Colbert declared, with the power vested in a late-night host, that the court was unconstitutional. \u201cI don\u2019t make this decision lightly,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m here to say that their decisions are \u2026 henceforth null and void, because they are poo-poo heads and completely divorced from what the people want and reality.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers celebrated a New York court\u2019s rejection of Trump\u2019s request to extend the payment period for his civil fraud penalty; as of now, he must either pay $454m or present a cash bond within 30 days. \u201cA lot of batshit stuff will happen in this election, so I think it\u2019s OK for us to just take a second and enjoy the sentence \u2018Trump doesn\u2019t have the money,\u2019\u201d Meyers laughed. Trump will probably have to sell off property to raise the money. \u201cI guess that means we should look forward to seeing his private jet joining the Spirit Airlines fleet,\u201d Meyers quipped. \u201cIf you upgrade to Comfort Plus, you get exclusive access to the gold toilet.\u201d Meyers also touched on the supreme court\u2019s decision to hear Trump\u2019s immunity defense. \u201cThe supreme court is a partisan institution that is there to protect Trump and do his bidding,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich of course undercuts the supreme court\u2019s self-styled image as an independent arbiter of the law. \u201cThe justices want to be seen as apolitical, but there can be no doubt now that they\u2019re very explicitly doing Trump\u2019s bidding after siding with him in his attempt to get his January 6 trial delayed until after the election,\u201d he added. \u201cKeep in mind, this isn\u2019t some sort of thorny, hotly contested constitutional issue that\u2019s been vexing scholars for decades, and where the lower courts are at loggerheads, thus forcing the high court to step in to reconcile contradictory rulings,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBasically everyone thinks this is ridiculous. Trump is saying: \u2018I\u2019m allowed to commit any crime I want, and nobody can do anything about it,\u2019 and the supreme court is like, \u2018Oh, yeah, maybe we\u2019ll take a look at that.\u2019\u201d Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped Trump\u2019s visit to the southern border \u201cto scream about Biden not doing anything to secure the border\u201d after strong-arming Republicans to renege on a deal that they made with Democrats to improve border security. Polls now show about half of Americans support construction of a wall along the border, \u201cwhich is just as dumb an idea as when Trump first threw it out there eight years ago,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cFirst of all, there already is a wall across the parts of the border where a wall makes sense. There\u2019s 706 miles of wall already. And second, walls \u2013 they\u2019re not magic. You can go over them, you can go under them, you can cut right through \u2013 basically, a wall is a great way to stop undocumented bighorn sheep from sneaking in here and taking jobs from American sheep.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump is looking for money for his fraud penalty of $454m or a bond to cover it. \u201cIn other words, a man who became famous for never paying anyone back has to convince a bonding company that he will definitely pay them back, and it\u2019s not happening,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cHe owes like a whole Powerball lottery jackpot\u201d and he may have to sell off property to reach it. \u201cBut that\u2019s a worst-case scenario,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cHis first move is to see how much he can get for Eric on Craigslist.\u201d",

        "body": "The idea was to celebrate one of the greatest British authors with a beautiful statue set up in a cathedral for the 250th anniversary of their birth. But at a public meeting to discuss the erection of a Jane Austen sculpture close to her final resting place at Winchester Cathedral, concerns were raised that it would lead to the \u201cDisneyfication\u201d of the place of worship and become a magnet for tourists keen to get a selfie. Elizabeth Proudman, an Austen expert and leading light in the Jane Austen Society, also suggested the author herself would not have approved of the statue and the fuss surrounding it. She said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what she looked like, but we do know that she was a very private person. She despised publicity.\u201d Austen is buried in the north nave aisle of Winchester Cathedral under a memorial stone, which mentions \u201cthe extraordinary endowments of her mind\u201d but does not provide any more detail about her career. The Hampshire cathedral says the anniversary \u201cpresents a significant opportunity to bring her legacy to even greater prominence\u201d and plans to erect the statue in the Inner Close. Proudman said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any statue is appropriate for this part of Winchester Cathedral. The Inner Close is where the monks had a private area, it\u2019s a special place. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to turn it into Disneyland-on-Itchen [the river that runs through the city]. I don\u2019t think the Inner Close is the place to attract a lot of American tourists to come and have a selfie with Jane Austen.\u201d The \u00a3100,000 statue is being created by the sculptor Martin Jennings, who created the official coin effigy of King Charles. His Austen statue, which he is still working on, captures her standing next to her writing desk, prompting Lizzie Dunford, the director of Jane Austen\u2019s House in Chawton, Hampshire, to question why she had not been depicted actually writing. After unveiling his preliminary model, Jennings said: \u201cThis is a work of the imagination as, I must emphasise, every work of art is. We don\u2019t know very much at all about what she looked like. I want the sculpture to express her spirit. \u201cIn life, she may have been aghast at being represented in this way. But after death, she belongs to all of us. I don\u2019t think we have, in any way, invaded her private personality. If she was writing, her head would be bent over and looking down. The figure is more dynamic.\u201d The Rev Canon Dr Roland Riem, the vice-dean of the cathedral, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t designed by committee. We have to trust the creative process and trust Martin with his creative gifts and experience.\u201d",

        "body": "The Zone of Interest, the Holocaust drama directed by Jonathan Glazer and adapted from the novel by Martin Amis, could pull off a shock upset in the best picture Oscar race and beat Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer, as a series of interviews with anonymous Oscar voters appears to indicate a surge of support for the film. After the voting window for the Academy Awards closed on Tuesday, the intervening period before the results are announced on Sunday week is filled with fevered speculation. Much of the fuel is provided by anonymised interviews with Oscar voters, known as the Brutally Honest Oscar Ballots, in which real-life Academy members talk through how they arrived at their particular choices, and in doing so shed much light on how individual films and performers benefit or are disadvantaged in the process. The brainchild of Hollywood Reporter columnist Scott Feinberg, the Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot is in fact contrary to Academy regulations, which bars \u201cshar[ing] your voting decisions at any point \u2026 includ[ing] speaking with press anonymously\u201d. But it has been a fixture for more than a decade, with revelations including the studio executive who said he never got around to seeing Mad Max: Fury Road and the actor who proclaimed she was \u201cjust sick of\u201d Meryl Streep. And the verdict on the 2024 crop is that The Zone of Interest is making an unexpectedly strong challenge for the Oscars headline award. Since its five-award victory at the Golden Globes, and the subsequent announcement of its status as Oscars nominations leader, the received wisdom is that Oppenheimer, the Christopher Nolan-directed biopic of atomic weapon scientist J Robert Oppenheimer, is the most likely winner of the best picture prize and is far ahead in the bookies\u2019 ratings. The vote-transfer system used by the Oscars is still expected to deliver a victory for Oppenheimer. However, enthusiastic endorsements from unnamed voters are a sign that The Zone of Interest should be taken seriously as a player in the race. The Academy voter interviewed in the Hollywood Reporter described it as \u201cwhat film-making is supposed to do\u201d, and said he had voted for it over Oppenheimer, while Variety magazine, which is also conducting its own anonymous interviews, said that two out of its five interviewees named The Zone of Interest as their choice for best picture \u2013 the same amount as for Oppenheimer \u2013 with one participant saying it \u201chaunted me ever since I saw it\u201d. With its largely German dialogue, The Zone of Interest is also nominated for the best international feature film Oscar, where it is the strong favourite to defeat the likes of air-crash drama Society of the Snow (selected by Spain) and toilet-cleaner character study Perfect Days (selected by Japan). The Zone of Interest\u2019s chances in this category were considerably improved after Cannes winner Anatomy of a Fall, its main non-English-language rival on the awards circuit, was not put forward for the international feature Oscar by its home country France, who opted for foodie romance The Taste of Things instead. However, the dynamic between The Zone of Interest and Anatomy of a Fall is expected to find an echo in the fortunes of Sandra H\u00fcller, who is nominated for best actress for her role in the latter, as a woman on trial for her husband\u2019s death; she also features in the former as Hedwig H\u00f6ss, wife of Auschwitz camp commandant Rudolf H\u00f6ss (played by Christian Friedel), but for which H\u00fcller did not receive a supporting actress nomination. The weight of both performances saw H\u00fcller named by the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Brutally Honest voter for best actress, in a category considered hitherto as a contest between Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon and Emma Stone for Poor Things, and by two of Variety\u2019s five anonymous interviewees. Given the tiny sample size, the views of the Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot does not make for a conclusive poll, but it is indicative that the race is far from done and dusted. The 96th Academy Awards will take place at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles on 10 March.",

        "body": "\u201cTranslators are like ninjas,\u201d the Israeli author Etgar Keret wrote in 2017. \u201cIf you notice them, they\u2019re no good.\u201d The literary translation community must have felt delighted at this upgrade to their image: no longer dictionary dorks, but lithe, black-clad assassins! The thrilling story of ninja translators is yet to be told, but Jennifer Croft, an eminent translator whose English version of Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s Flights won the International Booker prize in 2018, has put her own spin on the profession with this ambitious, fecund novel, her second after the autofictional Homesick (published in Spanish in 2014, then in English in 2019). Croft has been fascinated by translation since she was a child, and this novel is a deep dive into the complexities and ambiguities of the role. A translator\u2019s job is to render the original as faithfully as possible, yet they are also creating a new work of their own with every word they type. It\u2019s an artistic paradox, the kind that can\u2019t be represented straightforwardly in fiction. It needs something special \u2013 and Croft does not disappoint. The book\u2019s narrator is a translator, one of eight who gather periodically at the home of Irena Rey, a critically acclaimed Polish novelist, to write versions of her latest book in their mother tongues. They are so bound up by their work that they refer to each other by their languages, rather than names. Our narrator is called Spanish and she uses the collective \u201cwe\u201d liberally, speaking for the group, especially with reference to Rey, whom they revere: \u201cWe were all in love with her.\u201d Spanish wants us to think the translators are of one mind, like a Greek chorus. There\u2019s a twist, though: the text we are reading, written by Spanish, has itself been translated by another of the eight, English \u2013 and Spanish and English do not get along. English makes it clear, in her prefatory Note from the Translator, that she has her suspicions about Spanish\u2019s version of events, and has \u201ccorrected\u201d a few things as she went along. So we are faced with a (possibly) unreliable narrator, translated by a (possibly) unreliable translator. It\u2019s a hall of mirrors worthy of Nabokov, and indeed, there are echoes of his great work Pale Fire in the snide, funny footnotes English scatters through the text (\u201cHere I have preserved her ridiculous word\u201d). Upon this complex scaffolding Croft hangs a vivid story about what happens to the eight translators when Rey goes missing, leaving them alone in her house on the edge of Poland\u2019s Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest, a primal wilderness teeming with life. They search for her in its mossy undergrowth, but find only fungi \u2013 a central metaphor of the book, for what are translators if not symbionts, perhaps even parasites, using the raw materials of someone else\u2019s creativity to produce a florescence of their own? The group are lost until an email arrives with the text of Rey\u2019s new novel, ready for translation, at which point they learn each other\u2019s names and Spanish\u2019s \u201cwe\u201d falls away as each begins to assert their own identity. Drama ensues, secrets are spilt, characters couple up and the search for Rey becomes increasingly bizarre and unpredictable. There\u2019s a lot going on here; indeed, the book resembles Bia\u0142owie\u017ca forest in its wild and fertile proliferation of ideas. Croft just about manages to keep it all together, although her fondness for themes and metaphors comes at the expense of character development. The warring English and Spanish are a marvellous double act, but others who could also have been interesting (Serbian and Slovenian, for instance) are neglected. And the ending, which unites the group once more, falls a little flat after the intense 300-page buildup that has gone before. But it is to Croft\u2019s credit that she sustains her claustrophobic narrative so deftly, with plenty of plot twists. What ultimately makes this book such a pleasure, though, is the uniqueness of its perspective. Reading a translator translating a translator is a brain-twister like no other, and it can\u2019t fail to change the way you think about language. It feels like a privilege, too, to appreciate the passages that seem to have been written specifically to amuse her colleagues. Notably English\u2019s version of a work by a Polish poet deemed untranslatable, which runs: \u201cThe world persists, but insecurely! / The rustling trees grow ultratreely!\u201d You can picture translators gleefully texting it to each other with laughing-face emojis. It\u2019s a glimpse into a profession that serves as a fascinating metaphor for our parasitic, multilingual, creatively prolific world. \u2022 The Extinction of Irena Rey by Jennifer Croft is published by Scribe (\u00a316.99).

        "body": "Where to begin. The lessons in how to dress, or the lessons in how to live? Iris Apfel\u2019s 102 years were a masterclass in both. Really, of course, there\u2019s no debate. We start with the clothes, because the clothes are entirely unignorable. Not so much outfits, as living tableaux. A coat of gold-tipped duck feathers topped with a lei of turquoise pebbles at the neck. Embroidered Indian silk tunics with fringed suede trousers. Fuchsia satin boots and a banana-yellow tulle cape. Bangles stacked to the elbow, a slash of lipstick bright as apricot jam, those delicate, bird-like knuckles dusted with a clatter of sweetie-toned cocktail rings. Every day, Apfel left the house dressed as a picture of joy. \u201cLife is grey and dull,\u201d she says, in her deliciously chewy New York accent, in Albert Maysles\u2019 2014 documentary about her life. \u201cYou might as well have a little fun dressing up.\u201d But despite the rainbow pandemonium of her wardrobe and the cacophony of the egg-sized nuggets of souk-bought gems that rattled as she walked, there was a purity to her. She had incredible taste, but no snobbery. She once explained that her passion for accessorising came from her mother, who taught her that \u201cif you bought, for example, a simple little black dress, by changing the accessories, which are so transformative, you could make dozens of outfits out of the same basic piece.\u201d Apfel wore Dior haute couture with flea-market jewellery, layered a vintage Balenciaga coat over a Mickey Mouse T-shirt, mixed 19th-century ecclesiastical vestments with Topshop. As a designer and consultant she worked for H&amp;M and for the White House \u2013 Mrs Nixon, apparently, was \u201clovely\u201d \u2013 for Faye Dunaway and for Tommy Hilfiger. Her passion for beauty was democratic. Status, price tags, money \u2013 these were never the point. The pleasure came from joy. In a 2010 interview with the Observer, she explained that the first painting she ever bought, still hanging in her hallway, is probably by Velasquez, but that she had never had it authenticated, because if it really was she might be nervous to leave it hanging there, and what would be the point in that, since she wouldn\u2019t enjoy it? Apfel didn\u2019t dress like anyone else, because she didn\u2019t think like anyone else. She was a true original. And for all her iconoclasm, there was something august and stately about Apfel. She was a true aesthete, a deeply respected textile expert. You have to know the rules of style well to be able to break them with grace, and she did. She defied every rule of how a snowy-haired older woman should dress yet somehow retained an almost old-fashioned elegance. There was method in the madness, as well as irreverent humour. \u201cI think when you\u2019re paying $15,000 for a dress you\u2019re entitled to a pair of sleeves,\u201d she said in 2015. \u201cIt makes me crazy. Because everybody knows that older women, no matter how much of a jock you are, you look like a horse\u2019s arse in a strappy dress.\u201d There was wisdom behind those owlish glasses. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to do is live in the present, which is what I have always done,\u201d was one of many soundbites every bit as splendid as her best looks. Her 102 years are a testament to the energising power of fashion and it is fitting that, when she went, it was with chic timing, in the middle of Paris fashion week. As she once said, \u201cYou only have one trip. You might as well enjoy it.\u201d",

And a nice interview with Bring Me the Horizon by Ben\u2026 For anyone catching up on the night\u2019s non-Raye winners, here\u2019s a great essay by Shaad D\u2019Souza on the source of SZA\u2019s success. Here\u2019s the night in pictures. As long as our previously established Horlicks drinking game hasn\u2019t already put you to sleep, we have reached the end of a very safe evening, extremely short on anything political even by the Brits\u2019 standards. No firebrand performances, no references to Israel and Palestine; just one stand for trans rights, one for the sub-postmasters affected by the Horizon scandal and one for the rights of songwriters. It\u2019s not that you go to primetime shiny-floor ITV awards shows for biting commentary, but \u2026 there was a lot of unclaimed potential there. Maybe some of the nominees who lost out to Raye\u2019s \u2013 very deserved \u2013 wins had something up their festive sleeves. We\u2019ll never know. Having not had a hit of any substance since 2010, in recent years Kylie made genre forays into country and disco along with a Christmas album, and it looked like she was pootling off into cosy Radio 2 land. But she swerved decisively back to pop with Padam Padam: malevolently sexy and powered by firmly up-to-date programming, it sent a wriggle of pleasure through summer 2023, although people saying \u201cPadam?\u201d as a question got old after about five minutes. There\u2019s a whisper of Spinning Around as a portentous fanfare builds like the score to a particularly depressing Christopher Nolan film \u2013 but then we\u2019re into Padam Padam, with Kylie appearing atop a lofty plinth, that bit of staging long beloved by X Factor, Eurovision and more. She channels the same endearing everywoman energy she had on stage at that epic Glasto performance, clearly enjoying herself and \u2013 unlike Robbie Williams unforgivably didn\u2019t do in this slot a few years ago \u2013 just gives us hit after hit. Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Head begets a bit of Slow and then Love At First Sight \u2013 which squeezes even more dancefloor euphoria than Calvin &amp; Ellie and Chase &amp; Status managed. She keeps the dopamine pumping by finishing with All the Lovers, jumping around for the drop like a kid who\u2019s double-dropped fistfuls of Haribo. It\u2019s a wonderfully unguarded and joyous ending, matching Raye\u2019s jubiliation at her historic wins. Padam padam indeed! Our de facto national treasure (borrowed from Australia) acknowledges her lifetime in pop and the people who have buoyed her along the way: \u201cAlright I\u2019m just gonna be sobbing with Raye. Raye, you did that! You did that. Brits, thank you so much. I really tried to think hard about what to say tonight but I knew I couldn\u2019t plan anything and I knew it\u2019d be just about the emotion. For some of you it\u2019s been a lifetime \u2013 36 years and counting of experiences together and the thing that really gets me is the love of music and connection with people \u2026 I have friends in this room that I\u2019ve worked with through the years. My team now, thank you so much. There\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s still the 14-year-old girl in her room dreaming of making it in this industry and I met some of the Brits students before and I feel your promise \u2026 here I am with this and anything\u2019s possible. Thank you to each and every person who\u2019s been part of my journey, you have my heart forever and always, thank you so much!\u201d Everyone was welling up at Raye brining her grandma on stage \u2013 including Maya Jama, dabbing her eyes behind the camera. It\u2019s pretty much a clean sweep for Raye, who has won every award she was up for bar the best pop category \u2013 and she was in the best song category twice \u2013 and in doing so smashed the record for the most awards won in one year (previously four, held jointly by Adele, Blur and Harry Styles). To deliver the news is the headteacher of the Brits school \u2013 where Raye was a student for two years before dropping out as she felt \u201cconfined\u201d. Raye bursts into tears when her name is called, and brings her grandma Agatha Dawson-Amoah, resplendent in green velvet, up on stage with her, and grabs her hand at the podium before sobbing openly into the mic. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand what this means to me! This is\u2026 [weeps] I wanna thank Mike Sabath, executive producer, I love you, my best friend. I wanna thank my grandma for her prayers. My grandma is awake til 3am praying for me and my beautiful sisters, I love you so much. My middle name is Agatha and her name is Agatha Dawson! I wanna thank all of the writers and the musicians [weeps some more] Is this happening right now?! I\u2019m so sorry. I wanna thank all the writers who were part of this. I wanna thank \u2026 I\u2019m ugly crying on national television. I\u2019m so proud of this album, I\u2019m in love with music, all I ever wanted to be was an artist and now I\u2019m artist with an album of the year! Thank you so much to the Brits, this is too much, this is too much, really it is. Come on grandma, let\u2019s go!\u201d Long championed by the diaspora here, the rest of the UK has eventually come around to the charms of African pop, with massive chart hits for Burna Boy, Libianca and Tyla in recent years \u2013 and the biggest of all has been Calm Down by Nigerian vocalist Rema, which is the kind of perfect earworm that doesn\u2019t just go round your head all day but then also decides to buy a timeshare in your subconscious. Like Raye he gets a souped-up full-band arrangement but this one actually suits the song much better; the tempo has been slightly upped to keep the energy high, and perhaps to free up some more space for Maya Jama chatting about getting wrecked, as is her wont. But there\u2019s still space for the song to simmer down to a tender standstill, then explode into a bombastic coda. Rema has a gorgeous open book of a voice, and he negotiates the song\u2019s little curlicues with ease, making this one of the night\u2019s best performances. He\u2019s wearing the kind of fur hat that would see you right through a Yukon winter, and as a broadsheet journalist and father it behoves me to say \u201che must be bloody boiling in that\u201d. Named record of the year at the Grammys last month, Flowers now gets \u2026 more flowers at the Brits, though it\u2019s a fairly generic song in a category filled with more innovative ones \u2013 Doja Cat\u2019s Paint the Town Red, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Vampire, Rema\u2019s Calm Down, SZA\u2019s Kill Bill, Tyla\u2019s Water. Still, in terms of UK impact, it spent 10 weeks at UK No 1 last year, so the gong makes sense. Like most international superstars, Miley isn\u2019t here \u2013 \u201cwe forgive her cos she\u2019s got incredible hair,\u201d says presenter Bimini \u2013 but she\u2019s sent a video in which she is sporting massive hair and a tiny sparkly dress! \u201cHello to everybody at the Brits. I wanted to say thank you so much for voting Flowers as the international song of the year, and a special thank you for giving me somewhere to wear this dress. It\u2019s incredible to win but the real prize is having this incredible song hit around the world. I know this video is a little short but I just wanted it to match my dress.\u201d And with a twirl, she\u2019s done. The Canadian critic Carl Wilson recently described Miley as the next Cher, and it\u2019s hard to disagree. Finally, something approaching a political statement, after the brief Post Office comment earlier on. Presenting the international song category, former Drag Race star Bimini says: \u201cRight now in the UK it\u2019s a really difficult time for a lot of people, and trans people and non binary people more so, and I want you to know that everyone in this room loves you and you are valid, and trans rights are human rights.\u201d The reliance on drinking gags is so desperate that Roman Kemp is doing shots with Calvin Harris, who is long sober and having a mocktail. Though the \u201creveal\u201d is that Kemp\u2019s drink is a Saltburn shot, labelled \u201cHarry Styles\u2019 bathwater\u201d. Harris professes to have liked it. If this is what passes for spicy \u2026 someone smash the emergency \u201cJack Whitehall and Haim\u201d button. This is a pretty formidable category full of hugely worthy winners \u2013 Central Cee, Dave, J Hus, Jessie Ware, Little Simz \u2013 but claimed again by Raye, who looks around as if she\u2019s waiting for a candid camera to pop out. She even opens the envelope to check that yes, she has won her fifth award of the night. \u201cThank you to the Brits. There are so many ridiculously incredible artists here tonight, so this is especially overwhelming. Man, what is happening? What the hell is happening? Shoutout Croydon! South London! What! Shoutout my team! My sisters! My best friend Carly, I love you so much Carly, don\u2019t start me off! Thank you, this is unfair, this is unfair, this is wild. Somebody take this mic off me, I\u2019ve had my first drink. Thank you to the Brits, thank you so much!\u201d Can she make it to seven? Let\u2019s find out! Becky Hill won the dance category the last two years and was Olivia-Colman-at-the-Oscars levels of endearing when picking up each: someone who palpably loves dance music culture and isn\u2019t too cool to pretend she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s right there in her singing voice, too \u2013 gloriously histrionic and keen of feeling \u2013 and she\u2019s now become the patron saint of nights out in clubs where you make questionable life choices. Legend has it that if write \u201cmotive\u201d on a Be At One mirror in lipstick and chant her name three times she jumps out with a J\u00e4gerbomb. Chase &amp; Status\u2019s stock meanwhile is higher than ever: having stayed with a drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene that had waned out of the charts in recent years, they were ready to capitalise when it inevitably came back around, with their outrageously huge track Baddadan. They open with a snatch of Baddadan delivered by Irah, and then into the Hill-helmed Disconnect, whose headily rising melody has the requisite wobbly-eyed dancefloor headrush. They switch back again to Baddadan, if only for a brief spell, and back to Disconnect \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to conjure the feel of switching between two decks in a nightclub at the cavernous O2 Arena, but all concerned make a good stab at it, and Hill is in typically brilliant voice. This was a shot in the arm for a slightly deflated Brits. Hard to tell why some of the pre-announced awards, such as this one, are properly televised and some aren\u2019t; and whether producer is meant to acknowledge \u201csomeone who makes other people\u2019s songs\u201d or \u201cproduces dance music\u201d. Anyway. Here\u2019s a nice VT on how the duo drew inspiration from rave and have been ploughing the drum\u2019n\u2019bass furrow for nearly 20 years, albeit an incorrect voiceover about how they\u2019ve \u201cheadlined\u201d Glastonbury (they haven\u2019t). Saul Milton thanks the fans/mums/wives/management and \u201cthe big man Naylor\u201d, while Will Kennard adds: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to represent British music, to champion new talent always, but mostly tonight we are proud to represent drum\u2019n\u2019bass music.\u201d Presumably keeping things quick because they\u2019re up next with Becky Hill\u2026 There\u2019s a fairytale stardust across this performance, a coronation moment for a pop Cinderella who at one point was very much not invited to the ball, and left to toil in the depths of a major label for years. She extricated herself from that flatlining deal and became one of the UK\u2019s most successful independent artists, a turnaround marked by her record-breaking seven nominations. She\u2019s already won three Brits \u2013 and there\u2019s still some big awards she might still secure. She first performs Ice Cream Man on piano: a song about how she was sexually assaulted during a recording session, and the kind of raw and candid songwriting she didn\u2019t seem to get to make in her unhappy spell with Polydor Records. Then it\u2019s into an orchestral version of Prada, her mega-banger that earned her one of two song of the year nominations, and then a 1920s lindy-hop intro to Escapism \u2013 her other song of the year nomination \u2013 before switching up again into a sumptuous big band arrangement. For me, it\u2019s the crispness of the rap drum programming of the original that gives the song its urgency, and makes its tale of nihilist bacchanalia work, given that it\u2019s something you might actually listen to in a bout of nihilist bacchanalia. I don\u2019t think she needs the heavily telegraphed classiness of the orchestral version \u2013 this uniquely tortured song doesn\u2019t need or suit it \u2013 and perhaps there was too much packed into this megamix performance. But there\u2019s no doubting Raye\u2019s conviction, star quality and ability to carry her pain to the back of the biggest arenas \u2013 and it certainly looks like this evening is deservedly turning into that fairytale ending. Or rather beginning. Very brief cutaway to the table there as Clara Amfo introduces the Rising Star award winners. Says singer Abigail Morris of Raye\u2019s performance: \u201cYou know when Gaga did the VMAs in 2009? I feel like we just saw history being made.\u201d Finally, a proper Brits moment. Hair-raising! Boygenius announced their hiatus in February, presumably so that Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus can return to their respective solo careers. After winning three Grammy awards last month, this is a great final \u2013 for now \u2013 coronation for a supergroup greater than the sum of its parts, whose debut album The Record struck a huge chord with listeners and who were clearly having a great time during their performances and even their playful press (to wit: the brilliant photoshoot for our 2023 interview with them). Here they are on video, starting off with a massive \u201cwooooo!\u201d Julien: \u201cHello Brit awards, thank you for voting us best international group of the year!\u201d Lucy: \u201cWe wanna thank our label Polydor for making this possible. Long live Boygenius.\u201d Phoebe: \u201cThank you so much.\u201d Curious that ITV are leaning heavily on BBC property The Traitors here! Both Dua Lipa and Charli XCX are in this category on the strength of songs from the Barbie soundtrack, not even their own new album eras \u2013 both of which are just starting and will see them eligible next year \u2013 which suggests a barrel scraped a touch thin. But here\u2019s Dua winning the fan-voted category on the basis of Dance the Night. \u201cAmazing, thank you so much! Well I guess for more reasons than one my fans are the reasons why I\u2019m standing here today, so I wanna say a massive thank you to each and every single one of you who have voted for me. This means so much, I\u2019m so, so happy to be here. You guys give me this radical sense of confidence that I can do anything, I can try and experiment \u2026 and all the love and optimism and support is what inspires me, so thank you so much. Beyond that, it takes a village, so I want to thank my dad-ager \u2026 [thanks team/label at length, you can imagine the rest].\u201d If you need a pr\u00e9cis on who Jungle are, they named themselves after the some of the most forward-thinking music in the UK, and then proceeded to make some of the most backward-thinking music in the UK. They started out with the Fifa 14 loading screen-core of stuff like Busy Earnin\u2019 and have since graduated to what is very much the \u201clive laugh love\u201d of funk and soul music, with less edge than my toddler-proofed kitchen. Their decidedly un-pyroclastic 2023 album Volcano sound like a tepid mix of other artists with everything that made those artists good removed \u2013 it\u2019s no-sodium Sault; not so much the Temptations as the Ooh No I Musn\u2019ts. Or like someone asked that Adobe AI music software that dropped this week for \u201cJ Dilla for Tory barbecues\u201d. Indeed, they\u2019re so blah they should probably be put on an Arts Council protection list for artists most under threat of being replaced by artificial intelligence. They seem nice and one of them cried a bit at winning best group and I\u2019m not so jaded to not go a bit gooey at that \u2013 but come on, Young Fathers are right there. They\u2019re playing their sleeper hit Back on 74 which does have a pretty, if rather inconsequential-feeling, chorus melody \u2013 and the strutting dancers lift the cruise-ship-at-teatime feel just a little. But this is one of the most forgettable performance I can remember at the Brits, which is to say it feels like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones barged past Guardian security and hit me with that Men In Black mind ray. The earth spins onward and leaves this behind. This is an astonishing win, given that Casisdead is substantially less commercially successful than Central Cee, Little Simz, Dave and J Hus \u2013 and in a completely separate lane, too, flowing over a kind of 80s-inspired synthwave vibe. No one knows who he actually is \u2013 and that\u2019s not his \u201creal\u201d face, covered as it is by subtle prosthetics. It\u2019s a testament to him building a really devoted fanbase, in thrall to someone who has charted his own weird way through UK rap culture, shrugging off genre labels as he goes. \u201cThis is well funny. Look man, there\u2019s so many people involved in this record, I don\u2019t have time to thank everyone cos I know you wanna get pissed up so I\u2019ll keep it moving. I\u2019ll thank you guys personally later. Buy the vinyl cos the thank yous are in the vinyl. But what I do wanna do is take the time to thank the stans, without you none of this would happen \u2026 Thank you XL for letting me do what I want.\u201d And let Charli run the whole thing, co-presenting this award. \u201cShout out to all the hot girls in the place, where you at! Dua Lipa, Raye, where you at! OK we should do our job\u2026\u201d I feel like Fred Again and Romy have had more cultural significance this year but you can\u2019t argue with Miracle, the Ellie Goulding collab we saw earlier, spending eight weeks at UK No 1 last year. \u201cWow. Wow. Thank you. First and foremost I wanna dedicate this award to Danny Rampling\u2019s Love Groove Dance Party. I wanna thank Ellie Goulding, wherever she is. Ellie, I wouldnae be on this stage this year if it wasn\u2019t for you. What you brought to Miracle was unbelievable, I couldn\u2019t have done this with anybody else. Burns, who I\u2019ve been working with this year finally, my old friend, finally making tunes together this year. And I wanna say thank you to my beautiful wife [Vick Hope].\u201d JUST GIVE THE AWARD TO CHARLI, GIVE ALL THE AWARDS TO CHARLI Raye only needs one more award to tie Adele, Blur and and Harry Styles for the most awards received in a single year (ie four). As I wrote yesterday, \u201cbest new artist\u201d does seem like a particularly poignant category for Raye, who is nine years into her career but only started her second creatively free act two years ago. Great haughty pout from fellow nominee PinkPantheress there; meanwhile Raye and the lady handing out the microphone appear to be on first-name terms at this point: \u201cWhat is actually happening right now \u2018cause I just don\u2019t understand! I have to thank my mum and my dad who are also part of my team, and my grandma. Yes grandma! I, in ways, do feel like a new artist. I released my first song when I was 15, my first mixtape when I was 16, don\u2019t go and listen to it because it\u2019s not that good any more. But I do feel like a new artist, I got to start again. The artist I was three years ago would not believe what she\u2019s seeing today. I\u2019m my own boss now, I\u2019m in control. Thank you!\u201d Wait! Clara\u2019s out to give Raye another award, mentioning how she gave Raye her first radio play back when she was a teenager \u2013 and giving her the previously announced songwriter of the year award. (Which also makes the best new artist thing a bit absurd.) \u201cBrit awards coming like buses, you wait for one and three come along!\u201d says Clara, while Raye shakes her head and laughs \u2013 then remembers what she wants to say, taking a stand for songwriters\u2019 rights: \u201cOh wait sorry! Please, whilst I\u2019m here, British record music industry please, I just wanna have a brief conversation about normalising giving songwriters master royalty points. It can be net costs, it doesn\u2019t have to be at your expense, but it means if songs win big the writers win big too. Please allow that to happen.\u201d Even a year ago this booking might have felt a bit B-list but McRae has become so absolutely enormous in the interim that this now feels like a bit of a coup. Greedy, up for best international song, has been a vast success on streaming, and follow-up Exes hasn\u2019t done shabbily either. Anyone who had her pegged as a Billie Eilish clone in the wake of her bruised piano ballad You Broke Me First has been comprehensively proven wrong: some of her best performances have been over throbbing deep house (You), tech-y EDM (10.35) and glossy new wave (She\u2019s All I Wanna Be). We\u2019re getting Greedy here, and there\u2019s lots of purposeful walking while she lets the backing track do the heavy lifting. Of course there\u2019s a segment ringfenced for her to do her oft-viral bougie-streetdance choreography \u2013 and while my cardio levels are such that I could barely say my own name after doing all that, she does stay firmly in her vocal comfort zone again, idly moving around her middle range. It does feel a bit phoned-in, and can\u2019t help but feel disappointing given this is the biggest American star the Brits have conjured this year. Meanwhile, I\u2019m also having a full-on new-dad moment at being baffled by her abdominal fashion choices. OK new drinking game: take a sip of Horlicks every time the presenters make another wearying booze gag (\u201cgag\u201d) and hopefully you\u2019ll have conked out before the night ends. And we\u2019re back to the dreadful drinking \u201cgags\u201d, a mainstay of the Mo Gilligan era. Is Kylie Minogue going to drink from a shoe in the Australian \u201cshoey\u201d tradition? \u2026 Yes she is. Just say stilett-no. Oh boy, can\u2019t wait for \u201cAmerican superstar\u201d Tate McRae (she\u2019s Canadian) after the break. Maya Jama might be playing hard and fast with accuracy there on more than one level. The Brits can struggle to attract international pop superstars and hardly any of this category is here \u2013 only Asake, Caroline Polachek, CMAT and Kylie Minogue seem to be here from the nominations \u2013 and so it is with the winner SZA, who had a huge year in 2023 thanks to the December 2022 release of her sublime second album SOS and only appears tonight in video form. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for this honour, thank you for bumping my music, and I hear you\u2019re at the O2 which is my favourite \u2026 and I should be back really soon!\u201d I\u2019m on the floor among the celebs and everyone is wearing black leather \u2013 that seems to be a look this year. A lot of leather trousers on the men. All the ex-Love Islanders were loving Calvin and Ellie, which says a lot. ITV and the British music industry\u2019s primetime Saturday night showcase is going down well on Twitter. The only way to jazz it up: massive Kate Middleton reveal in the middle of Jungle\u2019s performance. The Sheffield band win the all-male category in a rare mainstream showing for British metal, often sorely overlooked at the Brits and the Mercury award. It\u2019s their first ever Brit award, though they performed live with Ed Sheeran a couple of years ago. I am extremely here for the cutaways to an extremely bored-looking Young Fathers, who should have won this. But here\u2019s to BMTH\u2019s sweary speech, which leads to a good part of it being blanked out. Oli Sykes: \u201cI reyt don\u2019t know what to say \u2018cause we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be winning this at all. Cheers to the Brits for making the voting system so complicated only our fans could be arsed, thanks to our fans [sweary sweary swearing] This is bloody insane this. Cheers to our management, family, all that stuff. I\u2019m not gonna say owt else, thank you so much, cheers. Reyt good.\u201d The UK may be a petty, pursed-lipped, radically ungenerous island \u2013 but certain things get me waving a Union Jack like I\u2019m the admin for a Facebook page about Spitfire maintenance, and our love of dance music is one of them. More than rap, more than indie-rock, more than Dua Lipa trying really hard, commercial dance is our national pop music, and the way we rallied around Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding\u2019s Miracle to send it to No 1 for eight weeks had me staring wistfully off the white cliffs of Dover. My millennial nostalgia was juiced by Harris essentially splicing trance classics Tell It to My Heart, Castles In the Sky and Seven Days and One Week, and Goulding\u2019s ethereality makes her the perfect trance vocalist. But you don\u2019t get a hit of this stature through nostalgia alone: it\u2019s a copper-bottomed bit of songwriting. Ellie Goulding stays in that ethereal tone throughout, rarely bringing in that rougher grade of sandpaper that so differentiates her voice from the rest of her peers \u2013 and of course Calvin uninterestingly prods some equipment that may or may not be plugged in. But just as this performance starts to feel a bit mid, he gives it the full Sundissential treatment with a hard-trance breakdown lifted from the Hardwell remix, as Ellie bounds around with her backing dancers like they\u2019re a bunch of kids who have just set a toilet on fire at Leeds festival. Vibes retrieved! Two down! This one is voted for by the public via Instagram. It\u2019s a new standalone genre category after musicians and fans complained about R&amp;B being conjoined with the pop slot last year: one of those musicians, Mahalia, was nominated this year. Arguably Raye does so much more than R&amp;B \u2013 and if we\u2019re talking genre purists, it would have been lovely to see Cleo Sol win this \u2013 but I begrudge her precisely nothing. \u201cWhat!\u201d she mouths as the camera turns to her. \u201cHi! Look I just wanna say, when I was about 16, 15 years old, I wanted to be an R&amp;B artist, that\u2019s what I would say. And I was told, I think, a lie that R&amp;B doesn\u2019t sell in the UK so I needed to learn how to make different kinds of music. I know that\u2019s a bit shady but I need to say R&amp;B is so important and there are so many R&amp;B artists in the UK eating it up. I wanna shout out to Mahalia, who campaigned for this award, Cleo Sol, who\u2019s immaculate, Sault. This really is a lot \u2013 thank you.\u201d MORE SHADE PLEASE! I will be passing Ben the smelling salts during this one as I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever known him to love a song so much in the six-plus years we\u2019ve worked together. I find Ellie Goulding\u2019s voice a bit like opening a bag of icing sugar, accidentally inhaling a bit and choking. \u201cThere\u2019s been some pretty awesome bands that have come out of the UK,\u201d says Billie Joe Armstrong. But \u2026 Jungle? Really? Young Fathers should have blitzed this with their fantastic, absurdist sound, showcased on last year\u2019s Heavy Heavy, our No 2 album of the year \u2013 and they look pretty nonplussed at their table \u2013 but instead it goes to Jungle, tepid white soul pastiche artists whose greatest contribution to British music is a lot of soundtracks for sports montages. It\u2019s their first Brit nomination and thus award, and they spend their excitable acceptance speech \u2013 which features the first sweary sound blot-out of the night on the ITV feed \u2013 thanking their team and families. Forgettable in every way. One down, five possible gongs to go! Raye wins her first award of the night for Escapism, one of the songs she claimed was left collecting dust in a filing cabinet when her former label Polydor declined to release it. More fool them: Raye went it alone as an independent artist, the song hit UK No 1, was the biggest-selling song by a British female artist in 2023 and it went many-times platinum all over the world. She is literally leaping up and down with glee \u2013 and in bare feet. \u201cAhhh! What! Thank you God, like wow! I\u2019m shaking. I didn\u2019t \u2026 I don\u2019t really know what to say right now but thank you, thank you to my team. Wow, I\u2019ve always dreamed of saying that, \u2018thank you to my team\u2019. Thank you to my distribution company who are called Human Resources, a small little imprint in America, no one else would take my songs but J [Erving], thank you for believing in this music. Thank you to Mike Sabbath, who collaborated on my entire album on this song. He made the beat, I heard it in the car. I can\u2019t believe this is happening, aaah!\u201d Loving her saying that she\u2019s always dreamed of saying \u201cthank you to my team\u201d! A graceful barb. Plus in the presenters\u2019 prelude, we got our first political statement of the night from the stars of ITV\u2019s Mr Bates vs the Post Office: \u201cIn spite of what the government say, they\u2019re not paying the postmasters.\u201d It would be inaccurate to say that Dua Lipa is entering her flop era \u2013 the first singles from her upcoming album, Houdini and Training Season, are currently in or around the top 20 most streamed songs globally on Spotify. But there\u2019s something a little gimlet-eyed in how they\u2019re written \u2013 catchy in a grimly determined rather than breezily natural way \u2013 that makes them hard to love, and some mean media types (not me, yet!) are wondering if she could be on the way down the other side of fame\u2019s hill. Well, that performance should quieten them down a bit. Dressed in her second leather ensemble of the night, she launches into Training Season and while I find this song really quite plodding and funkless on record, Lipa lifts this B-tier material with a really robust vocal performance \u2013 she sounds like she absolutely has to have the sexual-spiritual connection she\u2019s singing about, and her voice doesn\u2019t waver even when strutting around a populous troupe of acrobatic dancers. That\u2019s the kind of boot-camp vocal training that only peak pop stars can haul themselves through \u2013 and it makes for a potent opening. We\u2019re graced with a new cohort of presenters this year, Clara Amfo, Maya Jama and Roman Kemp. All dyed-in-the-wool actual presenters, the Brits are seemingly going for \u201cabject professionalism\u201d this year after the shambolic \u201ccomedy\u201d of Mo Gilligan the past two years. Or \u2026 70s variety show with this Love Island \u201ckiss cam\u201d bit? What! (I have never seen Love Island and have no idea what is going on here.) This Dua Lipa performance of Training Season is giving James Bond opening titles via Cirque de Soleil. Will this performance vanquish the \u201cgo on girl give us nothing\u201d meme spawned by her performance at the 2018 Brit awards? Pity these poor dancers, suspended above the stage waiting for Dua Lipa\u2019s opening performance to start. Excellent stuff happening on the ITV2 red carpet feed as the presenter asks Caroline Polachek whether her dress, with its elf-ears-cum-Madonna-cone-bra is \u201ca homemade affair\u201d? \u201cIf only,\u201d she says, barely hiding her disdain. \u201cThis is a Jean Paul Gaultier and Simone Rocha collab.\u201d [Presses delete on part two of costume box joke.] Two of Green Day here, looking like a middle-aged goth couple who used to be cool but have rung your Ring doorbell four times about your poor recycling bin management in recent weeks, but you\u2019re ignoring them, so they\u2019re getting right up to the camera to express their disapproval. Did Griff: 1. Struggle from option paralysis about which outfit to wear? 2. Have a fight with the Last Dinner Party over the costume box? Hard to tell. Olly Alexander, AKA our Eurovision entry this year, which is \u2026 fine. Bit mid-table. If you\u2019re a country people actually like. Which we\u2019re not. Here\u2019s Laura\u2019s review from yesterday. Big \u201cLawrence Llewellyn-Bowen hosting an immersive murder mystery weekend\u201d energy to this frock coat. Brits awards-art history hive: is that Joan of Arc down there? What does this represent if so? Shout out to Cass\u00f6, who is wearing an outfit so boring I haven\u2019t even bothered to crop the whole thing, but who I massively venerate after he made the mighty Prada \u2013 a huge high-tempo dance banger splicing Raye and D-Block Europe with the energy emanating from a Renault Clio packed with five 17-year-olds. He made it on a laptop while he was at Swansea uni and ended up becoming one of the biggest songs of 2023, spending 22 weeks in the Top 10, five of them at No 2 \u2013 and now it\u2019s up for song of the year. An unfairly little-trumpeted British success story. Here\u2019s Annie Clark AKA St Vincent, who just presented the Last Dinner Party with their Rising Star award on the ITV2 red carpet coverage \u2013 quite possibly because guitarist Emily Roberts plays a signature St Vincent guitar on stage. And there you have it: Joe Keery from Stranger Things, looking like the rhythm guitarist from a band in 2007 who are trying to get past that bruising 4/10 in the NME in 2005. Actually, though, he\u2019s a properly massive pop star as well, recording as Djo \u2013 his song End of Beginning is currently the fifth most streamed song in the world right now on Spotify with 5m plays a day. Oh spirit come, we beckon you! Oh wait it\u2019s best international artist nominee Caroline Polachek. Speaking of the Last Dinner Party, here is Alexis Petridis\u2019s review of their very hyped debut album. Bring Me the Horizon here, looking like they\u2019ve just been busted for smoking weed by their mum who\u2019s wandered over to the bus shelter with their dad hovering impotently behind. Hand it over lads! Look, to my mind they\u2019re the best band in the UK and would be thoroughly deserving winners of the rock/alternative category they\u2019re nominated in, following a year of awesome singles. Is it post-ironic to wear a dress saying \u201cI\u2019m Only Here For Your Entertainment\u201d in a sarcastic font to a primetime ITV-screened industry \u201cbash\u201d? Jury\u2019s out. Kylie looking overjoyed as you would be if you\u2019d been named a Global Icon (capital letters very much warranted). There will undoubtedly be a comprehensive costume change for when she accepts that award and probably another for closing the show with, we presume, a hits megamix centred around Padam Padam \u2013 by which time every music industry functionary will have had around twelve (12) bottles of wine and will be throwing shapes like someone bringing a plane into land in high winds. And the winner of next year\u2019s best song category is here: if you haven\u2019t heard Charli XCX\u2019s aggressively brilliant comeback single Von Dutch yet, you\u2019re 547 plays behind me and can catch up right here. Can\u2019t believe Victoria Beckham circa 2001 is here! Hello, Laura here. This week I learned that in 1959, Volvo invented the three-point car seatbelt and recognised that it was such a gamechanger in safety that the Swedish automobilists gave away the patent to other companies for free. Just on my mind as I look at this photo of best dance act nominee \u2013 and previous winner \u2013 Becky Hill for no reason, I am sure. (Becky is one of my favourite Brits characters of recent years thanks to her propensity for enjoying her table\u2019s liquid wares before coming up to collect her gongs.) I know it\u2019s a journo cliche to say that someone has dressed up like a Quality Street, but Jacob Collier is wearing three distinct Quality Street wrappers here and you very much suspect he considered a fourth. So all the multifarious reality TV stars who get on the red carpet at about 2pm yesterday have all filed through, leaving us with some actual musicians. Here\u2019s Casisdead, making a brilliant effort with a phalanx of bodyguards branded with his Deadcorp project name. I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of his album last year \u2013 I felt like the lyricism didn\u2019t meet the ambition of the overall endeavour \u2013 but he admirably does a lot more world-building than most British artists, creating an entire cyperpunk dystopia as a backdrop for his tales of crime and trauma. He\u2019s the outside bet in the rap genre category, up against some big beasts in the form of Central Cee, Dave, Little Simz and J Hus \u2013 but it\u2019s fan-voted, and his fans adore him, so he\u2019s got a chance. It may have less star power than the Grammys, less critical clout than the Mercury and essentially be a celebration of naked commercial success \u2013 but dammit, the Brit awards remain one of the most silly, palpably British and occasionally quite subversive shows in the global awards season. The big story this year is Raye already winning songwriter of the year and scoring a record seven nominations across the field tonight \u2013 including two in song of the year. Can she convert any, or indeed all of them? But there\u2019ll be plenty more action besides, from Dua Lipa opening the show to Kylie closing it as the Global Icon award winner. Join us here as we rate and slate the live performances and red carpet looks, and chart all the award-winners, speeches and \u2013 this being the Brits \u2013 moments of evident drunkenness.

        "body": "Dua Lipa It would be inaccurate to say that Dua Lipa is entering her flop era \u2013 the first singles from her upcoming album, Houdini and Training Season, are currently in or around the top 20 most streamed songs globally on Spotify. But there\u2019s something a little gimlet-eyed in how they\u2019re written \u2013 catchy in a grimly determined rather than breezily natural way \u2013 that makes them hard to love, and some mean media types (not me, yet!) are wondering if she could be on the way down the other side of fame\u2019s hill. Well, this performance should quieten them down a bit. Dressed in her second leather ensemble of the night, she launches into Training Season and while I find this song really quite plodding and funkless on record, Lipa lifts this B-tier material with a really robust vocal performance \u2013 she sounds like she absolutely has to have the sexual-spiritual connection she\u2019s singing about, and her voice doesn\u2019t waver even when strutting around a populous troupe of acrobatic dancers. That\u2019s the kind of boot-camp vocal training that only peak pop stars can haul themselves through \u2013 and it makes for a potent opening. Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding The UK may be a petty, pursed-lipped, radically ungenerous island \u2013 but certain things get me waving a Union Jack like I\u2019m the admin for a Facebook page about Spitfire maintenance, and our love of dance music is one of them. More than rap, more than indie-rock, more than Dua Lipa trying really hard, commercial dance is our national pop music, and the way we rallied around Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding\u2019s Miracle to send it to No 1 for eight weeks had me staring wistfully off the white cliffs of Dover. My millennial nostalgia was juiced by Harris essentially splicing trance classics Tell It to My Heart, Castles In the Sky and Seven Days and One Week, and Goulding\u2019s ethereality makes her the perfect trance vocalist. But you don\u2019t get a hit of this stature through nostalgia alone: it\u2019s a copper-bottomed bit of songwriting. Goulding stays in that ethereal tone throughout, rarely bringing in that rougher grade of sandpaper that so differentiates her voice from the rest of her peers \u2013 and of course Harris uninterestingly prods some equipment that may or may not be plugged in. But just as this performance starts to feel a bit mid, he gives it the full Sundissential treatment with a hard-trance breakdown taken from the song\u2019s remix by Hardwell, as Goulding bounds around with her backing dancers like they\u2019re a bunch of kids who have just set a toilet on fire at Leeds festival. Vibes retrieved! Tate McRae Even a year ago this booking might have felt a bit B-list but McRae has become so absolutely enormous in the interim that this now feels like a bit of a coup. Greedy, up for best international song, has been a vast success on streaming, and follow-up Exes hasn\u2019t done shabbily either. Anyone who had her pegged as a Billie Eilish clone in the wake of her bruised piano ballad You Broke Me First has been comprehensively proven wrong: some of her best performances have been over throbbing deep house (You), tech-y EDM (10.35) and glossy new wave (She\u2019s All I Wanna Be). We\u2019re getting Greedy here, and there\u2019s lots of purposeful walking while she lets the backing track do the heavy lifting. Of course there\u2019s a segment ringfenced for her to do her oft-viral bougie-streetdance choreography \u2013 and while my cardio levels are such that I could barely say my own name after doing all that, she does stay firmly in her vocal comfort zone again, idly moving around her middle range. It does feel a bit phoned-in, and can\u2019t help but feel disappointing given this is the biggest across-the-pond star the Brits have conjured this year. Meanwhile, I\u2019m also having a full-on new-dad moment at being baffled by her abdominal fashion choices. Jungle If you need a pr\u00e9cis on who Jungle are, they named themselves after the some of the most forward-thinking music in the UK, and then proceeded to make some of the most backward-thinking music in the UK. They started out with the Fifa-14-loading-screen-core of stuff like Busy Earnin\u2019 and have since graduated to what is very much the \u201clive laugh love\u201d of funk and soul music, with less edge than my toddler-proofed kitchen. Their decidedly un-pyroclastic 2023 album Volcano sound like a tepid mix of other artists with everything that made those artists good removed \u2013 it\u2019s no-sodium Sault; not so much the Temptations as the Ooh No I Musn\u2019ts. Or like someone asked that Adobe AI music software that dropped this week for \u201cJ Dilla for Tory barbecues\u201d. Indeed, they\u2019re so blah they should probably be put on an Arts Council protection list for artists most under threat of being replaced by artificial intelligence. They seem nice and one of them cried a bit at winning best group and I\u2019m not so jaded to not go a bit gooey at that \u2013 but come on, Young Fathers are right there. They\u2019re playing their sleeper hit Back on 74 which does have a pretty, if rather inconsequential-feeling, chorus melody \u2013 and the strutting dancers lift the cruise-ship-at-teatime feel just a little. But this is one of the most forgettable performances I can remember at the Brits, which is to say it feels like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones barged past Guardian security and hit me with that Men In Black mind ray. The earth spins onward and leaves this behind. Raye There\u2019s fairytale stardust across this performance, a coronation moment for a pop Cinderella who at one point was very much not invited to the ball, and left to toil in the depths of a major label for years. She extricated herself from that flatlining deal and became one of the UK\u2019s most successful independent artists, a turnaround marked by her record-breaking seven nominations and six wins. She first performs Ice Cream Man on piano: a song about how she was sexually assaulted during a recording session, and it\u2019s the kind of raw and candid songwriting she didn\u2019t seem to get to make in her unhappy spell with Polydor Records. Then it\u2019s into an orchestral version of Prada, her mega-banger that earned her one of two song of the year nominations, and then a 1920s lindy-hop intro to Escapism \u2013 her other song of the year nomination \u2013 before switching up again into a sumptuous big band arrangement. For me, it\u2019s the crispness of the rap drum programming of the original that gives the song its urgency, and makes its tale of nihilist bacchanalia work, given that it\u2019s something you might actually listen to in a bout of nihilist bacchanalia. I don\u2019t think she needs the heavily telegraphed classiness of the orchestral version \u2013 this uniquely tortured song doesn\u2019t need or suit it \u2013 and perhaps there was too much packed into this megamix performance. But there\u2019s no doubting Raye\u2019s conviction, star quality and ability to carry her pain to the back of the biggest arenas. Chase &amp; Status and Becky Hill Becky Hill won the dance category the last two years and was Olivia-Colman-at-the-Oscars levels of endearing when picking up each: someone who palpably loves dance music culture and isn\u2019t too cool to pretend she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s right there in her singing voice, too \u2013 gloriously histrionic and keen of feeling \u2013 and she\u2019s now become the patron saint of nights out in clubs where you make questionable life choices. Legend has it that if write \u201cmotive\u201d on a Be At One mirror in lipstick and chant her name three times she jumps out with a J\u00e4gerbomb. Chase &amp; Status\u2019s stock meanwhile is higher than ever: having stayed with a drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene that had waned out of the charts in recent years, they were ready to capitalise when it inevitably came back around, with their outrageously huge track Baddadan. They open with a snatch of Baddadan delivered by Irah, and then into the Hill-helmed Disconnect, whose headily rising melody has the requisite wobbly-eyed dancefloor headrush. They switch back again to Baddadan, if only for a brief spell, and back to Disconnect \u2013 it\u2019s not easy to conjure the feel of switching between two decks in a nightclub at the cavernous O2 Arena, but all concerned make a good stab at it, and Hill is in typically brilliant voice. This was a shot in the arm for a slightly deflated Brits. Rema Long championed by the diaspora here, the rest of the UK has eventually come around to the charms of African pop, with massive chart hits for Burna Boy, Libianca and Tyla in recent years \u2013 and the biggest of all has been Calm Down by Nigerian vocalist Rema, which is the kind of perfect earworm that doesn\u2019t just go round your head all day but then also decides to buy a timeshare in your subconscious. Like Raye he gets a souped-up full-band arrangement but this one actually suits the song much better; the tempo has been slightly upped to keep the energy high, and perhaps to free up some more space for host Maya Jama chatting about getting wrecked, as is her wont. But there\u2019s still space for the song to simmer down to a tender standstill, then explode into a bombastic coda. Rema has a gorgeous open book of a voice, and he negotiates the song\u2019s little curlicues with ease, making this one of the night\u2019s best performances. He\u2019s wearing the kind of fur hat that would see you right through a Yukon winter, and as a broadsheet journalist and father it behoves me to say \u201che must be bloody boiling in that\u201d. Kylie Minogue Having not had a hit of any substance since 2010, in recent years Kylie made genre forays into country and disco along with a Christmas album, and it looked like she was pootling off into cosy Radio 2 land. But she swerved decisively back to pop with Padam Padam: malevolently sexy and powered by firmly up-to-date programming, it sent a wriggle of pleasure through summer 2023, although people saying \u201cPadam?\u201d as a question got old after about five minutes. There\u2019s a whisper of Spinning Around as a portentous fanfare builds like the score to a particularly depressing Christopher Nolan film \u2013 but then we\u2019re into Padam Padam, with Kylie appearing atop a lofty plinth, that bit of staging long beloved by X Factor, Eurovision and more. She channels the same endearing everywoman energy she had on stage at that epic Glasto performance, clearly enjoying herself and \u2013 unlike Robbie Williams unforgivably didn\u2019t do in this slot a few years ago \u2013 just gives us hit after hit. Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head begets a bit of Slow and then Love at First Sight \u2013 which squeezes even more dancefloor euphoria than Calvin &amp; Ellie and Chase &amp; Status managed. She keeps the dopamine pumping by finishing with All the Lovers, jumping around for the drop like a kid who\u2019s double-dropped fistfuls of Haribo. It\u2019s a wonderfully unguarded and joyous ending, matching Raye\u2019s jubiliation at her historic wins.",

        "body": "If Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph is, as predicted, announced as winner of the supporting actress Oscar at the 96th Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles next weekend, the actor from Philadelphia will have to stride up to the podium and come up with the goods yet again. She has already spoken well at both the Golden Globes and Baftas when honoured for her role in The Holdovers. Let\u2019s hope she has something left in the bag. For Wendy Shanker it is a familiar predicament. The American script-doctor is regularly called upon to write a few wise words for potential award winners and at this time of year her phone is red hot. \u201cIt can be difficult if you\u2019ve already done acceptance speeches, like Da\u2019Vine. She will want to have kept back something that\u2019s unique for the Oscar. But then she might not get it,\u201d she said this weekend. \u201cSo I often help clients find that fine balance between making the most of it and hanging everything on it.\u201d On Oscar night, television viewers might well suspect some of the victorious stars have not prepared a jot. Sadly, in Shanker\u2019s view, this is often the case. \u201cI wish they would all write something. It\u2019s a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone should; even the dark horse nominees, not just the favourites.\u201d She suggests it is simply \u201cgracious to prepare something\u201d, rather than to hope to endear by stuttering out a few lines about gratitude and childhood destiny. \u201cBut I know why many don\u2019t prepare. They are superstitious and I do understand that,\u201d she said. Certainly, the pressure on nominees in Hollywood\u2019s Dolby theatre is immense. It is a career highlight like no other, after all. Even Steven Spielberg described it as \u201cthe best drink of water after the longest drought in my life\u201d when he finally won for Schindler\u2019s List in 1994. And, co-mingled with a fear of jinxing one\u2019s luck, it is easy to imagine a parallel concern that looking too slick could look entitled. Surely there are a few successful actors who don\u2019t enjoy all the hoopla and who are quietly willing the statuette into another nominee\u2019s hands? Generally not, says Shanker. \u201cThere are a few introverts, like Joaquin Phoenix, who really don\u2019t like the pomp and circumstance. But for most it\u2019s a dream, after years rehearsing an acceptance speech into their toothbrush.\u201d It was Phoenix who in 2020 gave a textbook seriously socially conscious speech when he won for Joker. He spoke at length about the shame of calves being taken from their mothers in service of milk production. \u201cWe go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources,\u201d he said. Was it a worthy use of a brief worldwide platform? Well, for Larry David it formed the basis of an episode of sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm in which Woody Harrelson parodied an actor who brings his vegetarian politics to the microphone at a moment of triumph. Other key political speeches from the Oscar archives include Michael Moore\u2019s criticism of the Iraq War as he received an award for his 2003 gun-control documentary, Bowling for Columbine. Moore was booed and later recalled being told, \u201cWow, you really know how to ruin a standing ovation.\u201d Vanessa Redgrave also went for broke when she criticised \u201cZionist hoodlums\u201d who were giving Jews a bad name when she picked up a best supporting actress gong in 1978. Better received was Frances McDormand, a winner in 2018, who called on Meryl Streep to lead the crowd in taking to her feet in support of the women in the industry. It is important to get your facts right though, as discovered by Spectre songwriter Sam Smith in 2016 after the false suggestion that \u201cno openly gay man had ever won\u201d before. Marlon Brando\u2019s notorious decision to get actor Sacheen Littlefeather to turn down his 1973 award, in protest at the treatment of American Indians, was dented by the revelation she was not a Native American. (This year Lily Gladstone, descended from the Blackfeet and Nez Perce nations, may actually make history by winning for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon.) Shanker is a fan of an emotional speech, as demonstrated by Sally Field in 1985, when she cried out deliriously: \u201cI can\u2019t deny the fact that you like me, right now, you like me!\u201d. Many will also recall Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s tears when she won for Shakespeare in Love in 1999. Her father had just been diagnosed with cancer and so she was forgiven. Will Smith\u2019s attempts to earn back credit after he slapped host Chris Rock in 2022 also had major wattage. Winning an Oscar later for King Richard, Smith said: \u201cIn this business, you\u2019ve got to be able to have people disrespecting you, and you\u2019ve got to smile and you\u2019ve got to pretend like that\u2019s OK.\u201d Another good route, if you have the comedy chops, is to have some fun. Witty Dianne Wiest, a best supporting actress for Hannah and Her Sisters, said: \u201cGee, this isn\u2019t like I imagined it would be in the bathtub.\u201d While Olivia Colman won laughs in 2019 for pointing starstruck at Lady Gaga, then poking her tongue out at the teleprompter urging her to wrap up. The prize for the longest speech still goes to Greer Garson who won for Mrs Miniver in 1943. \u201cI\u2019m practically unprepared,\u201d she began at 1am, then continued for seven minutes. Nowadays the ceremony\u2019s infamous, swelling \u201cget off the stage\u201d music would have harried her away. A final word must go to the weird ones: those speeches that have mystified or amused. Matthew McConaughey, accepting his award for Dallas Buyers Club in 2014, began by thanking God, then talked of chasing his \u201chero\u201d, himself a decade on, while Italian Roberto Benigni declared, \u201cI would like to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody and lie down in the firmament making love to everybody\u201d in his 1999 speech. Shanker, who sees herself as a secret weapon for nominees, advises clients to stay close to their public persona and to focus on enjoying the appreciation of their peers. It is not necessary, she insists, to thank everyone you ever met, which Julia Roberts, among others, did in 2001. \u201cYou may throw a few thanks out there,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you\u2019re Bradley Cooper in Maestro, you\u2019re going to want to thank the make-up artist.\u201d But perhaps the crown for Oscars\u2019 gratitude should go to Daniel Kaluuya, though, who in 2021 thanked many people, including his parents for originally having had sex \u2013 which clearly alarmed the middle-aged couple who were watching the show in front of a camera at home in London.",

        "body": "When Peter Wright first created his production of The Sleeping Beauty for the renovated Birmingham Hippodrome in 1984, it was a significant stepping stone on the way to the Sadler\u2019s Wells Royal Ballet\u2019s move to the West Midlands city, where it became the Birmingham Royal Ballet, a jewel in the crown of the council\u2019s policy of reviving the fortunes of the city through generous support of the arts. How times change. The company\u2019s current artistic director, Carlos Acosta, has mounted a 40th-anniversary revival just as the bankrupt local authority has withdrawn support from all the arts organisations it once part-funded. Birmingham Royal Ballet will survive, but the cut is a sign of how far artistic ambition in national and local government has receded from the high-water mark that this handsome, expansive production represents. Acosta himself still believes; his passion for making his company not only world-class but also accessible and enticing to new audiences is shown as much by this revival as it was by last year\u2019s new commission Black Sabbath: The Ballet. The Sleeping Beauty is a work that puts a company through its paces, offering a workout for the dancers and magic for audiences. Wright\u2019s version is pretty traditional, with the Lilac Fairy and Carabosse, the good and bad fairies, fighting over Princess Aurora\u2019s future, in long dresses and elaborate headdresses. \u201cIt\u2019s Maleficent, only she\u2019s not called that,\u201d one mother explained to her young daughter as Carabosse appeared high on a bier carried by pirate-hatted attendants. In Daria Stanciulescu\u2019s glittering performance, the bad fairy certainly commands attention; poor Eilis Small as her benign counterpart has a disappointing grey gown and rather too much mime to contend with. Many of the costumes are originals, and Philip Prowse\u2019s bronze, gold and deep red designs still gleam as the choreography moves briskly through the story, the dancers rising to its challenges with plenty of commitment and varying degrees of success. In the fairytale final act, Riku Ito and Beatrice Parma shimmered in the Bluebird pas de deux, and Sofia Li\u00f1ares, who shone in various roles throughout, brought a sense of happiness to the celebratory pas de quatre. Yu Kurihara is a very young and pretty Aurora; her nerves sometimes showed as she faced the technical demands of the famous Rose Adagio, but she\u2019s light and lively and was beautifully partnered by Lachlan Monaghan as Florimund, lending feeling and panache to possibly the most thankless prince role in ballet. Someone, though, needs to look at the lighting, which is often unaccountably dark and flat. Perhaps they should talk to Dimitris Papaioannou, the Greek choreographer, whose ability to conjure an entire world of shadows and highlights, of dark and light is once more on display in his latest work, Ink, at Sadler\u2019s Wells in London. Lit in stark contrasts by Lucien Laborderie and Stephanos Droussiotis, it looks utterly sensational, sometimes like a black hole, sometimes a silvery shell, a space surrounded by swathes of transparent plastic and full of water that arches from a jet making its own squelchy soundscape. In this mysterious arena Papaioannou (dressed in black) and the mainly naked \u0160uka Horn grapple for power and control. Horn first appears crawling under sheets of heavy plastic that Papaioannou uses to imprison him like Frankenstein controlling the monster. Perhaps the battle is between id and ego, or wildness and civilisation. There\u2019s also an octopus and a baby. The images tantalise and sometimes terrify, but they don\u2019t always cohere. Star ratings (out of five) The Sleeping Beauty \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Dimitris Papaioannou: Ink \u2605\u2605\u2605 Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s The Sleeping Beauty tours until 27 April",

        "body": "Steph Tisdell isn\u2019t a dog person or a cat person \u2013 she\u2019s a bird person. The comedian and actor has two Amazon parrots named Michael Parkinson (\u201cParky\u201d) and Eddie McGuire (\u201cEddie\u201d or \u201cEdzy\u201d). \u201cPeople get birds and keep them in cages \u2013 that\u2019s not what they\u2019re there for,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have an exotic parrot, they require a huge amount of work, a lot more work than a dog does. But they\u2019re so worth it. They sing, they dance, they talk \u2026 They\u2019re just really good companions.\u201d When she\u2019s not at home with her birds, the Yidinji woman is busy on stage and screen. Although she\u2019s known for being funny, Tisdell\u2019s breakout screen role was in political drama Total Control. She\u2019s since joined the cast of Bump, and gives a standout performance in comedy series Class of \u201907. She is also moderating a \u201cfeminist roast\u201d at the All About Women festival in Sydney. Here, the funny woman gets serious about her beloved birds, and shares the stories of other important belongings. What I\u2019d save from my house in a fire A drawing my niece did. I have it up on the fridge and love looking at it every day. She made it on a really nice day we spent together when she was seven. We did these drawings of Bluey and then I said to her, what if we made an animal that looked like Bluey, but wasn\u2019t a dog? So we made a Bluey unicorn. My niece reminds me of me as a kid. I was really creative but also quite academic, and I think she\u2019s the same. There\u2019s always a focus on academia, and so I love showing her that you can be creative too. My most useful object I have an ice-cream container that is the most perfect size for my bird food. Actually, even better is the measuring cup that I serve out their food with. My entire life is my birds. You know those people who treat their animals like they\u2019re children? I can\u2019t stand those people. But I\u2019m one of them now! [Before I had to go to Sydney to film Total Control] I went to a place in Brisbane called Northside Produce, because they have heaps of birds \u2013 aviary birds, chickens, all of that, and I saw this little baby Amazon, which they don\u2019t normally have. And he was obsessed with me. As I walked in, he bit a kid, which I thought was funny. But when I went over, he just jumped on me, and it took three staff members to get him off. So I picked him up the next day and we drove to Sydney together. I didn\u2019t feel crazy for talking out loud to him. He got me through the hardest period of my life, and he was there for the biggest thing that had happened in my career to that point. Amazons aren\u2019t solo birds \u2013 they\u2019re the second or third smartest bird species in the world. So I got him a little friend for my birthday, another Amazon. They act like brothers \u2013 they fight. They are best friends. They sing opera. For about an hour every day, we sing songs together. They make me happy. The item I most regret losing An iPod that I had years and years ago \u2013 it must have been 2009. I got mugged on a trip to Jamaica and it was taken. And I had my first love on this trip \u2013 a holiday romance with an English guy. He had downloaded all of his songs on to my iPod, and a lot of songs that were really important to us and explained how he felt about me. We got mugged on our last night and it was because we were canoodling and holding hands \u2013 we were easy prey. But those songs were symbolic of our relationship; my first love. Steph Tisdell will appear at the All About Women festival on Sunday 10 March at the Sydney Opera House.",

        "body": "\u2018An opera of dazzling surfaces, knowing theatrical tropes and deliberate distancing effects,\u201d is how director Polly Graham describes The Rake\u2019s Progress, in a programme note for her new staging for English Touring Opera. Completed in 1951, Stravinsky\u2019s ironic Hogarthian parable ranges allusively through operatic history in its exploration of the relationship between indolent Tom Rakewell and demonic Nick Shadow, deploying the formalities of 18th-century opera \u2013 recitative, aria and ensemble \u2013 to distance us from the protagonists even as the music itself exposes their thoughts and feelings with extraordinary poignancy. But where Stravinsky strives for narrative clarity, Graham on occasion tips stylisation towards surrealism, with uneven results. April Dalton\u2019s designs elide Rococo frippery with the distortion of Dal\u00ed, as pictures of eyes and lips materialise on the walls of Mother Goose\u2019s brothel, and bizarre bric-a-brac fills the house where Baba (Lauren Young) lives with Tom (Frederick Jones, unwell on opening night; his understudy, Brenton Spiteri, sang the last two acts from the side of the stage). Some of it is unduly busy. The opening scene between Tom and Anne (Nazan Fikret) now takes place at a May Day festival, during which Tom is already being eyed by Shadow (Jerome Knox), while masked pagan figures, half-human, half animal, dance round a maypole. There\u2019s more maypole later on in the graveyard scene, which proves distracting. Some of it is striking. Casting a younger baritone than usual as Shadow allows her to present the pair as alter egos rather than middle-aged mentor and hapless protege. We\u2019re never quite sure whether or not London is a hell on earth populated by Shadows\u2019s demonic minions, while Bedlam, ironically, seems the only calm place in a world where \u201cgood or bad, all men are mad,\u201d as Baba puts it. Elsewhere, however, Graham\u2019s ideas sometimes don\u2019t quite work. Anne sets out to redeem Tom as a warrior heroine in trousers and chainmail, brandishing a sword like Bradamante in Handel\u2019s Alcina, which comes close to undermining Stravinsky\u2019s depiction of her courage as born of simple goodness. That it does not is due to Fikret, who sings with a wonderfully silvery tone and great depth of feeling throughout. This is one of several superb performances in an evening which, musically, is consistently fine. Knox\u2019s elegant Shadow is all the more dangerous for being so plausibly charming, even when he is at his most malevolent. A couple of moments of wayward intonation apart, Jones didn\u2019t sound as if he was struggling in Act I: Spiteri\u2019s voice is slightly darker, nicely combining weight with lyricism. Young, meanwhile, makes a really fine Baba, funny, self-assured, tellingly compassionate beneath the self-dramatisation. In the pit, Jack Sheen propels the score urgently forwards. It\u2019s beautifully played with some wonderfully precise, elegant instrumental solos, and the choral singing is first rate. \u2022 At Norwich Theatre Royal on 8 March, then touring",

        "body": "Thanks to her keen eye, Atlanta singer-songwriter Faye Webster first made waves as a hip-hop photographer. Being school buddies with local rap luminaries helped too. The petal-voiced Webster is now five albums into a body of delicate, powerful work that always captures more than first appears. This album\u2019s pithy trailer, But Not Kiss, describes a stymied relationship with someone out of reach. Alongside Webster\u2019s wounded, barely-there vocal, the song\u2019s multiple tempos bear witness to the stop-start of the pair\u2019s commitment levels. Often, on songs such as He Loves Me Yeah!, a base-level indie chug establishes Webster\u2019s output somewhere familiar. You might file her body of work under 70s-tinged alt-country. But Webster\u2019s subtle accessorising \u2013 her eclectic production choices, like Feeling Good Today\u2019s Auto-Tuned multitracking \u2013 always render these miniatures next-level. No less a lead guitarist than Wilco\u2019s jazz-trained Nels Cline is often on hand to lay plangent classiness atop her tunes. The album\u2019s title reflects Webster\u2019s habit of going to classical concerts at the last minute to assuage heartbreak; a flurry of orchestral strings appears and disappears almost immediately. Most fun of all is when schoolfriend Lil Yachty guests on Lego Ring, where the pair\u2019s harmonies are woozily Auto-Tuned.",

        "body": "If there\u2019s another blockbuster this year that matches the visual impact of Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune: Part Two, I\u2019ll eat my desert boots. The second Dune instalment is jaw-on-the-floor spectacular. It elegantly weaves together top-tier special effects and arresting cinematography; it layers muscle, sinew and savagery on to the bones of Part One. It\u2019s an inhospitable, brutal kind of beauty that Villeneuve has created \u2013 there\u2019s not enough lip balm in the universe to make a visit to the sandblasted wilderness planet of Arrakis look appealing. But this epic action picture, which follows the journey of Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) from a cheeky whippersnapper who\u2019s a bit handy with a sword, to a feared warrior, to the prophesied leader of the Fremen tribe of Arrakis, is realised with a retina-searing intensity. So how is it that Villeneuve has been able to succeed \u2013 and make no mistake, Dune: Part Two is an emphatic success \u2013 in adapting a book that was long considered to be unfilmable? The breadth and scope of Dune, Frank Herbert\u2019s 1965 far-future saga of interstellar feudal conflict, proved a daunting prospect to previous prospective film-makers. The generous budget available to Villeneuve\u2019s pictures certainly helps \u2013 the lack of funds was the factor that sank Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s proposed 14-hour film adaptation of the book in the early 1970s. And studio support is another \u2013 while Warner Brothers hasn\u2019t exactly covered itself in glory recently, as anyone who has been following the Coyote vs Acme debacle will know, it has at least given Villeneuve the space and freedom to achieve his creative vision (compare this with David Lynch\u2019s less happy experience with his version of Dune, originally intended to run at three hours, then unceremoniously hacked down by nearly 40 minutes). But a crucial element in Villeneuve\u2019s approach, a creative ethos that gels particularly effectively with the material, is his firm commitment to showing rather than telling. A chunk of exposition at the very start of the film, delivered as an entry into the \u201cImperial Diary\u2019\u2019 and narrated by Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh), neatly proves how futile it is to attempt to unpick the intricacies of this densely plotted chronicle. In this case, too much dialogue and plot explanation drain the energy from the picture; it\u2019s far more effective to employ Villeneuve\u2019s preferred tactic of exploring the story visually. This technique occasionally misfires, with some of the transitions between vividly created scenes and set pieces feeling a little cursory and disjointed. But on the whole, it does no harm at all to bathe the audience in heady, colour-saturated atmosphere rather than to spoon-feed them with easily digestible gobbets of plot. Although Paul is the main focus of the story, this instalment allows other characters to come to the fore, most notably Fremen warrior Chani (an impressive, physically committed performance from the always magnetic Zendaya). But a standout in a supporting role is Austin Butler, playing Feyd-Rautha, the psychopathic nephew of Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s levitating despot, Baron Harkonnen. A vast, seat-shuddering spectacle like this movie is no place for subtlety, and Butler evidently got that particular memo. From the moment he tests the calibre of a freshly sharpened blade with his extended tongue, before trying it on the throat of one of his slaves, he is phenomenal. It\u2019s a gleefully over-the-top performance fuelled by malice and channelled through axe-blade cheekbones and a smile that could strip the skin from your face. Equally impressive and only slightly less disturbing is Rebecca Ferguson, reprising her role of Lady Jessica, Paul\u2019s mother. Driven by her ambition for her son, and twisted by the gruelling ritual that transforms her into the Reverend Mother of the Fremen, Jessica takes on a chilling ruthlessness, something that Ferguson manages to convey almost entirely through an icily inscrutable gaze and a collection of facial tattoos. The immense, breathtaking visuals and the grandstanding performances are more than matched by Hans Zimmer\u2019s behemoth of a score. There are passages so thunderous, it sounds as though he somehow harnessed the noise of colliding planets in place of percussion. It\u2019s a fittingly ominous accompaniment to a story that lurches away from passionate idealism, truth and romance, and towards political machinations, betrayals, zealotry, the weaponisation of fear and the looming threat of a devastating religious war. There are moments when Dune: Part Two feels uncomfortably timely.",

        "body": "Nikki Haley on Sunday declined to say she would support Donald Trump in the coming presidential election if he won the Republican party\u2019s nomination to face Joe Biden in the race for the White House. The former South Carolina governor is the last serious opposition to Trump who seems almost certain to become the nominee, despite a raft of legal problems and the multiple trials he faces linked to his businesses, attempts to subvert American democracy and alleged hush-money payoffs to former lovers. Trump has swept the Republican contest so far and maintains a dominant lead across the country ahead of Super Tuesday. Earlier in the race all Republican candidates were required by the Republican National Committee to pledge loyalty to the winning eventual candidate as a requirement to taking part in the party\u2019s televised debates \u2013 which Trump himself refused to participate in. In an interview with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press show on Sunday Haley acknowledged making the pledge of loyalty but said she did not feel bound by it any more. In recent weeks the RNC has been hit by turmoil and a change in leadership to make it more pro-Trump. \u201cThe RNC is now not the same RNC,\u201d Haley said. When asked directly on the show if she would endorse Trump were she not to be the nominee Haley did not answer but instead insisted that she has \u201cserious concerns about Donald Trump. I have even more concerns about Joe Biden.\u201d Haley\u2019s ailing attempt to stop Trump securing the Republican presidential nomination got a recent vital boost with the endorsement of two senior senators who have given the former South Republican governor their backing ahead of Super Tuesday\u2019s crucial contests. The Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have both now endorsed Haley\u2019s bid. \u201cAmerica needs someone with the right values, vigor, and judgment to serve as our next president \u2013 and in this race, there is no one better than her [Haley\u2019],\u201d Murkowski said in a statement. She added: \u201cNikki will be a strong leader and uphold the ideals of the Republican party while serving as a President for all Americans.\u201d Meanwhile, Collins told the Bangor News that she had voted for Haley in the Maine primary, saying Hayley was \u201cextremely well-qualified\u201d to be the first female president. \u201cShe has the energy, intellect, and temperament that we need to lead our country in these very tumultuous times,\u201d Collins said in a statement to the outlet. Collins and Murkowski are now part of a very small group of Republican lawmakers to have spurned Trump in favor of Haley. Trump\u2019s grip on the wider Republican party remains firm as he consolidates his overwhelming lead in the race and he has already mostly focused his campaign targeting president Joe Biden.",

        "body": "Start with people you know If you\u2019re not sure about house-swapping but looking to dip your toe in the water, exchange with people you have a connection with, rather than strangers. Naomi Kendall, an artist based in Somerset, has embarked on several home swaps. She says: \u201cYou can\u2019t be too precious about your home, but equally, you need to feel comfortable with the people you swap with, so you\u2019re not worrying the whole time. You need to think about your neighbours a bit, too. We\u2019ve only swapped with people we knew, or people who were friends of friends.\u201d Find the right platform If you are ready to switch with strangers, platforms such as HomeExchange, HomeLink and Home Base Holidays (which also runs the Guardian\u2019s own website, Guardian Home Exchange) let you list your property, browse places where you would like to stay, and contact the owners to see if they would be interested in swapping with you. These charge an annual fee: at the time of writing, Home Base Holidays charged \u00a349 a year, HomeLink \u00a3120 and HomeExchange \u00a3180. In most cases, no other money will change hands. These platforms offer direct swaps with another homeowner. You get in touch with each other, and if they want to swap with you, you discuss all the details and make a plan that suits everyone. The switch doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be simultaneous \u2013 perhaps you are going away somewhere in August, and the other family comes to stay in your house, then while that family are away in a different destination in October, you go to stay in their empty house. As well as swaps with only two parties involved, HomeExchange has a \u201cGuestPoints\u201d system where you can let people stay in your home when you are away, in return for a number of GuestPoints, then use those points as a credit for a stay in another home at another date. Trust in your house A few platforms \u2013 for example, the US-based site Kindred \u2013 operate an applications system, where they check your home meets its minimum requirements \u2013 for example, wifi, a workspace and \u201ctasteful\u201d decoration. On many platforms, though, you simply tick the boxes to show your facilities, and the process becomes self-regulating, with people opting for swaps that meet their requirements. A lot of people worry they will stay somewhere incredible and their guests will, in turn, be underwhelmed. Your home doesn\u2019t need to be perfect, but do be candid in your descriptions. When creating your listing, clear clutter and make it look as appealing as you can for the photos, but include images of the avocado bathroom suite you plan to update, so there are no surprises. For most platforms you don\u2019t need to own your home, but, says Mark Sealey, the chief executive of Home Base Holidays: \u201cMembers who rent their homes must get an agreement from their landlord or letting agency before listing the property for home swapping.\u201d Sell your area It\u2019s not just about the house \u2013 people want a base from which to explore. Even if you don\u2019t live in a tourist hotspot, mention any places of interest that are within an hour or so\u2019s drive \u2013 cities, national parks, beaches, attractions, anything that might pique people\u2019s curiosity \u2013 and include photos. Tell your insurer The Association of British Insurers (ABI) advises that you speak to your home insurer to see whether a swap would have an impact on your cover. \u201cYour insurer will also be able to advise on what exclusions may be in your policy regarding loss or damage caused by guests,\u201d an ABI spokesperson says. Pikl, an insurer specialising in cover for \u201cthe sharing economy\u201d, is among the firms offering a property host top-up policy suitable for home swapping or Airbnb-style lets if your existing policy is inadequate. Ad hoc cover is available from \u00a32 a day, and cover for up to 30 days in a year is \u00a339.99. It covers fire damage caused by the guests, accidental or malicious damage, as well as public liability up to \u00a32m an event if the guests were to get injured as a result of the house swap. You need permission for the swap from your main insurer for the top-up policy to be valid. Some people swap cars as well as homes. Check whether your motor insurance provider will allow this \u2013 if it does, you may need to provide licence details for the driver and pay extra. Your exchange partner should do the same for you. Sealey says some Home Base Holidays members have split the cost of car rental in cases where insurance policies are too restrictive for one party to borrow a car. Expect charming imperfections One person\u2019s \u201cclean and tidy\u201d is another\u2019s \u201chow do they live like this?\u201d \u201cThe vast majority of places that are swapped are people\u2019s year-round homes, so they are not always going to be perfect,\u201d Sealey says. \u201cOccasionally issues occur because people don\u2019t have the same approach to housekeeping. If your home is immaculate and you need the place you stay in to be the same, ask questions to find out how your potential swapper approaches cleaning.\u201d Be flexible \u201cIf you need to be in Madrid on a certain date in April for a wedding, it might be difficult to find a suitable swap,\u201d says Caroline Connolly, the country manager for HomeLink UK. \u201cBut if you can say \u2018we\u2019d like to go to Spain in the summer\u2019, you\u2019re far more likely to find something that works for you.\u201d When you register, you can specify destinations or leave that open \u2013 some say that being open-minded about locations can lead to more interesting swaps. Connolly\u2019s first-ever swap was to a house in Saint John in New Brunswick, Canada \u2013 a place that she would have struggled to find on a map at the time. \u201cIt turned out to be incredible,\u201d she says. Take your time and ask questions \u201cThe first contact you have with members will be very much feeling things out,\u201d Sealey says. \u201cGive yourself plenty of time to find the right place and build trust with one another.\u201d Ask a lot of questions \u2013 and be prepared to answer them \u2013 and check the address on Google Maps to see if there is something that might be a problem for you, such as road noise or busy city centre nightlife if you are a light sleeper. Phillippa Rose from London and her family have swapped homes several times using HomeExchange, staying in homes in the UK, France and Spain. Rose recommends meeting online before the swap: \u201cI find a live video call really nice, just to get to know the people you\u2019re swapping with, and you can have a virtual show-around, too.\u201d Leave a small welcome pack with information on your home and the area, and consider recording videos to help with any quirks \u2013 for example, if there is a knack to opening the washing machine door. \u201cThe owners in France recorded a video to show how to change the pool filter \u2013 it\u2019s much easier to see how things work on a video,\u201d Rose says. Store your stuff and keep things clean Before the swap, spring clean, clear clutter, and perhaps put away anything particularly breakable or valuable, or your child\u2019s precious Lego creations. Store things in the attic if you have one, or take a box round to a friend or family member\u2019s home. \u201cWe have members who do longer-term swaps, say for three months, and in those cases they might rent storage units,\u201d says Sealey. \u201cWe lock certain things in a cupboard, and we make sure we empty a couple of drawers in the bedrooms for guests to use,\u201d Rose says. Rather than emptying wardrobes containing the family\u2019s clothes, they provide freestanding clothes rails. Aside from one broken lightbulb, she says she has never had any problems with guests. Unless you are very unlucky, your home will be well looked-after, Sealey says: \u201cMost experienced house swappers like to leave the home in as good a state, or even better, than they found it. There is a spirit of respect here: this is someone\u2019s home and they have welcomed you into it, so you should take care of it.\u201d",

        "body": "In an extended dialogue between Marilynne Robinson and Barack Obama, published a few years ago in the New York Review of Books, Obama homes in on the dimension of Robinson\u2019s writing that makes her so unusual as a 21st-century literary figure. \u201cYou\u2019re a novelist,\u201d he observes, \u201cbut you\u2019re also \u2013 can I call you a theologian? Does that sound, like, too stuffy? You care a lot about Christian thought.\u201d This could be described as something of an understatement. Robinson wears her faith on the sleeves of most of her books. In the epic Gilead series, which brought her a Pulitzer prize and worldwide renown, she probes with gentle but forensic subtlety into the religious preoccupations \u2013 and doubts \u2013 of two fictional midwest pastors. More recently, in collections of essays such as What Are We Doing Here?, she combines theology with cultural commentary to explore what her vision of a Christian humanism might contribute to a politically polarised, divided, 21st-century west. In her latest religious study, Robinson pursues this project by going back to the very beginning \u2013 to Genesis, the first book of the Bible. Most of us have at least a hazy idea of the contents of this ancient text, from God\u2019s creation of the world in six days to the dramatic exiling of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, and the subsequent two-by-two salvage operation of Noah\u2019s ark. Robinson takes it to have been written as a kind of origin story for a liberated nation, after the Israelites\u2019 exodus from Egypt. In luminous prose she challenges a modern reader to understand just how unusual a book Genesis is, pregnant with meaning that stretches to our own day. Robinson illustrates how the ancient Hebrew authors borrowed liberally from the Babylonian mythologies created by their near-east neighbours. But with a crucial distinction. Great narratives such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Enuma Elish feature fickle, rivalrous deities who turn their ruthless gaze on mortals only when it serves their interest. In stark contrast, Genesis portrays a troubled love story between humanity and a divine creator who is described as, extraordinarily, \u201chaving created man in his own image\u201d. The vision of a single omniscient and benevolent God is a staggering new departure in ancient literature, with implications all the way down to design details. In the Garden of Eden, Robinson points out, \u201cthe beauty of the trees is noted before the fact that they yield food\u201d. Here is a world packed with signs of a divine desire that the first humans feel at home. Compared with the surrounding myths on offer, this vision \u201cis from the beginning an immeasurable elevation of status\u201d. It all goes wrong, of course, as a highly ill-advised decision to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil leads to disaster and banishment. Robinson deftly guides the reader through Genesis\u2019s account of how human history proper, red in tooth and claw, gets under way as God tries to keep faith with his errant creations. Seminal episodes such as Cain\u2019s murder of Abel, the razing of Sodom and Abraham\u2019s near-sacrifice of Isaac \u2013 the son the old patriarch waited so long to see \u2013 are interpreted with a novelist\u2019s eye for drama. The sections dealing with Joseph\u2019s treacherous brothers are a psychological tour de force, as this guilt-ridden crew descend into a spiral of angst after selling their father\u2019s favourite son into Egyptian slavery. But the point is that God works in mysterious ways. The brothers\u2019 heinous act later proves providential when Joseph, having become one of the most powerful men in Egypt, is able to rescue the Israelites from famine. By refusing to leave the really ugly human stuff out, Robinson suggests, the ancient scribes produced a book \u201cnot primarily meant to offer examples of virtue or heroism\u2026 but meant instead to trace the workings of God\u2019s loyalty to humankind through disgrace and failure and even crime\u201d. More than two millennia later, beyond the poetic and literary fascination of the text, can this narrative say anything meaningful to a secular mind? Robinson implies that it can, at a gloomy moment when \u201cthe natural order and the social order are fraying together\u201d. In the face of contemporary atrocities, geopolitical strife and the threat of human-made environmental catastrophe, a work championing the goodness of creation and the infinite value of human life can offer a salutary read, calling us to our responsibilities. And in the ancient rabbis\u2019 account of a merciful God who refuses to write his people off in spite of everything, Robinson finds a way to produce a powerful meditation on hope at a time when that virtue is generally in short supply. For many fans of Robinson\u2019s novels, such ruminations may fall outside their conceptual comfort zone. But for devotees of the Gilead series, Reading Genesis also serves as one of the best primers they will get for the theological world of its protagonists, the Reverends John Ames and Robert Boughton. In Gilead, as he senses death approaching, Ames vainly tries to imagine heaven but can\u2019t get past the first base of feeling simple awe for the world he is still in. \u201cEach morning,\u201d he writes in a letter intended to be read one day by his young son, \u201cI\u2019m like Adam waking up in Eden, amazed at the cleverness of my hands and at the brilliance pouring into my mind through my eyes.\u201d In this rich and provoking study, Robinson has masterfully traced that sense of wonder back to its ancient, remarkable source.

        "body": "Jennifer Aniston first told us: \u201cHere comes the science bit \u2026 concentrate\u201d when selling shampoo in the late 1990s. But with everything from medical-grade serums to gut-boosting yoghurts filling our shelves the \u201cscience bit\u201d has truly taken over. However, experts warn that more regulation is needed in the beauty and wellness industry to ensure that consumers are aware of genuinely innovative products compared to those selling false claims. Analysts at Kantar put the growing popularity of science-backed beauty and wellness products down to people having more access to information through social media. This has resulted in greater awareness of the benefits of specific ingredients, they say. Dionne Officer, a research analyst at Mintel, said 67% of UK adults wanted beauty brands to provide more scientific validation. Additionally, 36% of all products that claimed to be science-backed in the last five years were launched in the last 12 months Mintel data shows. The value of the gut health industry alone is expected to rise from \u00a341bn to \u00a370bn by 2030. The Zoe nutrition plan, co-founded by the epidemiologist and gut health expert Dr Tim Spector, has more than 130,000 sign-ups since its launch in 2022. The skincare brand Lyma, which is putting its products through doctor-led trials, had a waiting list of thousands when it launched last year. This week, the company, co-created by an accredited plastic surgeon, brings to market a \u00a34,995 medical-grade at-home laser. Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator for McGill University, said consumers were \u201cquick to believe something is good for us if it\u2019s brand new and cutting edge\u201d. He said: \u201cConsumers may have tried a product with yesterday\u2019s molecule in it and been disappointed with the results, but just like with diets, there\u2019s always a fresh new thing to try with the promise that, this time, it will work.\u201d Lyma\u2019s founder, Lucy Goff, whose company boasts its products are based on scientifically backed breakthroughs, says there has long been a fascination with longevity since Greek mythology and recent technological innovations can help improve how the body works. She added: \u201cThe problem is that so many companies and brands have jumped on the well-tech bandwagon when it\u2019s a marketing ploy and this is where the government has to act more responsibly to put consumer benchmarks in place so consumers know what they are buying into, empowering consumers to be educated in what is credible science and what is marketing hype.\u201d The UK government department responsible for the cosmetics laws is the Office for Product Safety and Standards. These laws are enforced by Trading Standards. However, there is no standard around certain claims or rules around what can be dubbed scientifically proven to work. Goff gives the example of the sun cream market, saying that there is a \u201cconsumer benchmark\u201d on the back of the bottle to \u201cshow how well a product will work\u201d but this does not exist for other creams and supplements. \u201cThe benchmark should be not what the company is telling you but what is peer-reviewed science backing that up \u2026 consumers are not educated in this area and brands are manipulating that, and that is what has to stop.\u201d Timothy Caulfield, a research chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta, coined the term \u201cscienceploitation\u201d to describe how brands borrow language from emerging areas of science to market unproven products. He takes the example of a recent boost in interest in \u201cgut health\u201d. While microbiome and gut health is an exciting emerging area, he says, it takes years of research to explore what works and what does not. Dr James Kinross, a senior lecturer in colorectal surgery and consultant surgeon at Imperial College London, says \u201cmost supplements that allege to target the microbiome, don\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cHaving said that, there is lots of good evidence for pro, pre and synbiotics, the problem is accessing this information to make helpful decisions.\u201d Kinross said that the \u201creal problem is that most of these products don\u2019t do what we really need which is to optimise the microbiome for health to prevent disease.\u201d He advises that eating 30g more fibre a day could be the best and simplest way of helping your colonic microbiome. He added: \u201cThe consumer is often asked to spend a lot of money on these products; sometimes as part of a subscription model or sometimes as part of a platform that charges you for the pleasure of handing over all of your data to Silicon Valley. Be very wary of these products.\u201d Kinross invests \u201cin products that have reproducible science, which are cost-effective and those which have an ethical data policy.\u201d Caulfield said consumers should be sceptical of brands even if they are led by scientists or professors because \u201ca lot of academics are under pressure to hype their work up\u201d. He gives examples of stem cell genomics and microbiomes. \u201cThey are exciting areas of science but think how few clinical applications we have,\u201d he said. Caulfield said it was getting harder for customers to distinguish between good and bad products because there was \u201cso much noise\u201d and you could find something that \u201clegitimises\u201d false claims on the internet. His advice is to look for claims that are not clearly explained to avoid products that will not deliver as much as they promise. After all, while times may have changed the old L\u2019Or\u00e9al adage remains, and as Aniston would say, it\u2019s \u201cbecause you\u2019re worth it.\u201d",

        "body": "Plenty of classical composers have a reputation these days. Some are good \u2013 think of the celebrated jollity of \u201cPapa Haydn\u201d or Beethoven\u2019s tantalisingly struggle-fuelled inspirations. Others are less positive, from Rossini\u2019s image as a workshy tunesmith to Wagner\u2019s as a megalomaniac antisemite. Yet surely no mainstream classical composer is more often dismissed as simply \u201cboring\u201d than Austrian symphonist Anton Bruckner. His symphonies are certainly massive, no matter what you make of the venerable quip that Bruckner recomposed the same one nine times. Of course, one listener\u2019s longueurs are another\u2019s immersive epic \u2013 and this devoutly Catholic, counterpoint-obsessed musician also has his superfans. They were out in force for the Big Bruckner Weekend marking the composer\u2019s 200th anniversary at Gateshead\u2019s Glasshouse International Centre for Music \u2013 one coachload was rumoured to have come all the way from Dorset. But the five concerts were clearly aimed at agnostics and newcomers as well: broadcaster John Suchet did double-duty throughout as MC and hype-man. The thing about back-to-back performances of Bruckner\u2019s last three symphonies \u2013 plus his \u201cGreat\u201d Mass No 3 and his String Quintet \u2013 is that there\u2019s no escaping the challenges of his music, as well as its pleasures. I don\u2019t just mean its marathon duration. While these are all pieces from the XXL rail of the classical wardrobe, most of us would sit for longer through films, plays, operas or sports matches. Unlike any of those, though, Bruckner\u2019s works don\u2019t have in-built narratives to carry you along. Like the joke about Bruckner\u2019s beloved Wagner, alas, there were some beautiful moments in the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra\u2019s opening performance of the Seventh Symphony but some long half-hours. It was clear when the musicians were enjoying the broad sweep of Bruckner\u2019s slow-burn melodies and the trumpets were thrillingly incisive throughout, the tuba a dark shadow across the texture. (The less said about the tuning of the Wagner tubas in this or most other performances this weekend, the better.) That Domingo Hindoyan conducted from memory was a major feat. What was missing, however, was a sense of overall shape and momentum driving through Bruckner\u2019s slabs of thematic material. The finale\u2019s vast orchestral unison landed like a breeze block on a pile of toy bricks: impressive in its way, but dislocated from an already bitty performance. A rendition of the String Quintet by five musicians from the Royal Northern Sinfonia (playing to a home crowd in the petite, in-the-round space of Sage 2) suffered something similar. Bruckner\u2019s only chamber work is full of finicky motivic small-print and, regardless of periodic tuning issues, there was a serious wood-for-trees problem here. The full-sized RNS was more persuasive in Bruckner\u2019s Mass No 3 \u2013 its forces beguilingly intimate, in fact, alongside the combined mega-choir of Durham University Choral Society and the Chorus of Royal Northern Sinfonia. The choral sound was gloriously warm and finely balanced with the RNS by conductor Thomas Zehetmair to create textures of gleaming lucidity. Among the soloists, Elizabeth Watts and Hanna Hipp stood out \u2013 Hipp\u2019s fantastically dark timbre the ideal foil for the bright edges of Watts\u2019s soprano. Only hours later, the 1,640-seater Sage 1 was packed for what turned out to be a Bruckner masterclass: the Eighth Symphony from the Hall\u00e9 under outgoing music director Mark Elder. \u201cWe were a bit worried the piece might be too butch for the hall\u201d, Elder told Suchet afterwards, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t.\u201d No indeed. From the absolute precision of the horn\u2019s first note to the terrifying timpani strokes of the finale, Elder\u2019s ear for detail was matched by the hall\u2019s bright, crystalline acoustic. Barely shifting on the podium, the conductor moved musically from 0 to 60 with the flick of a baton; the string syncopations in the Adagio became a kind of tectonic shifting under the surface; the climaxes were catastrophic. That, I assumed, would be peak Bruckner for the weekend. But Sunday afternoon saw Alpesh Chauhan and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra serve up a Ninth Symphony every bit as compelling. A charismatic, balletic conductor, Chauhan jabbed and scooped at the air in front of him; passages that could have been yet more repetition were held in absolute tension with a poised little finger. Most remarkable, however, was the journey from laid-back sonic beauty in the first movement via an extravagantly off-kilter push and pull in the scherzo to a phenomenally intense third movement, by turns majestic and breathtakingly gentle. As a Bruckner first-timer marvelled to me at the end, \u201cWhat\u2019s not to love?\u201d",

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, will announce the fund in Melbourne on Tuesday when he addresses a gathering of 100 chief executives from Australia and south-east Asia. Albanese will say in a speech that he is pursuing \u201cthe most significant upgrade of Australia\u2019s economic engagement with Asean for a generation\u201d, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He will also promise to improve access to longer-term visas for south-east Asian travellers, saying this \u201cdemonstrates unequivocally that Australia is open for business, tourism and trade\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The $2bn south-east Asia investment financing facility is to be managed by Export Finance Australia. It is expected to provide loans, guarantees, equity and insurance to increase Australian trade and investment in south-east Asia. \u201cThe government I lead has made it clear: more than any other region, south-east Asia is where Australia\u2019s future lies,\u201d Albanese will tell business leaders, according to speech notes distributed to media in advance. He will say Australia\u2019s two-way trade with Asean member states topped $178bn in 2022 \u2013 and two-way investment was worth $307bn \u2013 \u201cbut we want to do more to support regional growth and to realise mutual benefits\u201d. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said he would speak to the same gathering of investors on Tuesday \u201cbecause we really believe we can turbocharge these relationships with Asean countries\u201d. Chalmers said Asean was \u201cthe hope of the side when it comes to two-way trade\u201d. As a bloc, he said, it was already Australia\u2019s second-biggest trading partner. \u201c[It is] bigger than the US, bigger than Japan, bigger than the EU, second only to China,\u201d Chalmers told Sky News. \u201cThis is where the action is \u2013 in Asean \u2013 and we want to get a bigger slice of that action.\u201d On Tuesday the government will also earmark $140m over four years to extend the Partnerships for Infrastructure Program. The program has helped fund transport, clean energy and telecommunications projects since launching in 2021. Australia will set up regional \u201clanding pads\u201d in Jakarta and Ho Chi Minh City to \u201cprovide on-the-ground support to help Australian businesses to boost technology services exports to south-east Asian markets\u201d. Trade and investment are a major focus of this week\u2019s special summit in Melbourne, held to mark 50 years since Australia became Asean\u2019s first dialogue partner. But security and great power rivalry between China and the US also loom large. China, like Australia, is not a member of Asean but is a dialogue partner to the regional bloc. Some Asean members have tensions with China over competing maritime and territorial claims in the South China Sea, but the regional bloc resists taking sides in the strategic contest between Beijing and Washington. The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, warned on Monday that \u201cthe region\u2019s character\u201d was under challenge, including in the South China Sea. In a veiled reference to China, Wong said: \u201cWe face destabilising, provocative and coercive actions, including unsafe conduct at sea and in the air and militarisation of disputed features.\u201d Addressing a maritime cooperation forum at the special summit, Wong called for a regional balance \u201cwhere no country dominates and no country is dominated\u201d and \u201cwhere each country can pursue its own aspirations\u201d. Wong welcomed the resumption of leader-level and military-level dialogue between China and the US as \u201cimportant steps on the path towards stability that the region has called for\u201d. But she said all countries, not just the major powers, must \u201cshape habits of cooperation that sustain the character of our region\u201d. She said all countries should \u201cinsist differences are managed through dialogue, not force\u201d and \u201cinsist that communication never be withheld as a punishment or offered as a reward\u201d. \u201cWe want to support Asean member states to ensure, collectively, we all have the practical tools we need to be able to rapidly and effectively deescalate tensions and crises.\u201d Wong said the government would commit $64m over the next four years to help Asean countries \u201cincrease resilience to coercion and ensure waterways that serve us all remain open and accessible\u201d. Albanese met the Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, in Melbourne on Monday and promised closer collaboration on issues including cybersecurity and nuclear non-proliferation. Malaysia was an early critic of Australia\u2019s plan to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, but Anwar avoided direct criticism of the Aukus pact at his joint press conference with Albanese. Anwar expanded on his recent comments about a rise of \u201cChina-phobia\u201d in the west. \u201cWe are an independent nation. We are fiercely independent. We do not want to be dictated by any force,\u201d Anwar told reporters. He said Malaysia remained \u201can important friend to the US and Europe and here in Australia\u201d but that \u201cshould not preclude us from being friendly to one of our important neighbours, precisely China\u201d. \u201cAnd if they have problems with China, they should not impose it upon us. We do not have a problem with China.\u201d",

        "body": "For almost 90 years the UK\u2019s electricity grid has served us well. So well, in fact, that it is easy to take for granted. We put the kettle on and know it will boil. Flick a switch and lo, there is light. But with the shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energy, the grid, which we rely on so much in our day-to-day lives, is in need of an upgrade. That\u2019s because it was originally engineered to connect coal and gas-fired power stations that were built on the coal seams running down the centre of the country. But our reliance on fossil fuels is being replaced by renewable sources of energy, which are generated in large part by offshore windfarms, as well as solar. So significant new infrastructure is needed to connect that renewable energy from where it\u2019s generated to where it\u2019s needed by homes and businesses right across the country. National Grid, the company that builds and maintains the UK\u2019s electricity grid infrastructure, has a plan to solve this: The Great Grid Upgrade. Billed as the largest overhaul of the UK\u2019s electricity transmission grid in generations, The Great Grid Upgrade represents a significant shift in infrastructure development, according to Joseph Northwood, director, portfolio development and strategy at National Grid. \u201cOver the next decade we will be undertaking one of the biggest ever infrastructure build outs in the UK, with 17 major onshore and offshore projects to deliver. That is the step change required.\u201d So why is it needed, and how will it touch all our lives? Adding value to the economy National Grid needs to build five times more electricity transmission infrastructure over the next six years than it has constructed over the past three decades \u2013 something that could provide a serious boost to the economy. According to government figures, The Great Grid Upgrade could create as many as 130,000 jobs and contribute up to \u00a311bn to the economy. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just engineering and construction jobs,\u201d says Northwood. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a huge range of skills to deliver these projects from design through to delivery \u2013 chartered surveyors, planners, IT and environmental professionals, procurement specialists, visual designers, project managers, apprentices, and many more.\u201d The wide geographic scope of the upgrades means new jobs will be distributed right across the country. And it\u2019s not just the projects themselves that will stimulate job creation \u2013 connecting more renewables to the grid will see new job opportunities in other areas too, such as solar and wind, as well as the automotive sector (through increasing demand for electric vehicles) and the heat pump market. \u201cIt also creates an opportunity for the UK to put itself on the map as an economy that is leaning into the green energy transition,\u201d says Northwood. \u201cIf we develop those skills in the UK, they can be further utilised by other economies as they go through their energy transition.\u201d Safeguarding national energy security Replacing expensive imported fossil fuels with cheaper, cleaner, domestic sources of energy will prevent the kind of big hikes in our bills we saw after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \u201cWhen you look at energy bills, the bit that fluctuates most is the commodity, because it is a finite resource and it is less secure,\u201d says Northwood. \u201cThe energy transition will bring that volatile component down. That resilience, the security and diversity of supply, is going to be delivered by this infrastructure and we are working hard to deliver a network that enables this, while delivering a secure, diverse mix of clean energy to our hospitals, schools, homes and businesses.\u201d Helping the UK to reach net zero at pace If we\u2019re to achieve net zero by 2050, as the climate emergency requires us to, millions of UK households and many thousands of businesses will need to adopt new technologies. \u201cTechnological evolution and innovation create a demand for energy that has to be catered for,\u201d says Northwood. And these changes could also be good for your finances: the Treasury\u2019s Net Zero Review suggested that the average electricity bill in 2050 for a household with an electric vehicle and a heat pump could be broadly similar or even lower than the average electricity, heat and transport fuel costs for a household in 2019 with an internal combustion engine vehicle and a gas boiler. The electrification of heating, transport and industry is expected to result in a rapid increase in demand: by 2050, we could be using twice as much electricity as we do today. The government has set a target of adding up to 50GW of offshore wind to Britain\u2019s energy mix by 2030 and is also targeting a fivefold increase in solar deployment, to 70GW, by 2035. But we can\u2019t connect these new clean, green sources of supply to the grid without upgrading our electricity infrastructure. Getting new renewable energy projects connected to the grid as quickly as possible will give the UK a much better chance of successfully achieving net zero and bringing bills down. The Great Grid Upgrade is, in that sense, the very foundation of the country\u2019s energy transition. \u201cThe fundamental point of the transition is to sustain and to enhance the environment we live in,\u201d says Northwood, \u201censuring that it is preserved not only for our generation, but generations to come.\u201d Find out more about The Great Grid Upgrade at nationalgrid.com/tggu",

        "body": "If there\u2019s one thing the Oscars are usually sniffy about, it\u2019s a mainstream blockbuster. They may garner nominations but winning is a different matter altogether. But Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, an effervescent comedy about the world\u2019s most famous doll that wraps up a zingy dissection of the patriarchy, women\u2019s lack of power and mortality in a bright bow, is not your standard blockbuster. And that\u2019s exactly why it deserves that best picture Oscar. Meryl Streep wasn\u2019t being hyperbolic when she credited Barbie for saving the film industry and \u201call of our jobs\u201d at this year\u2019s Palm Springs film awards. It became 2023\u2019s highest grossing film and the 14th highest-grossing film of all time after cashing in $1.4bn at the worldwide box office. Barbie swept in like a pastel-hued tsunami through an industry that had been sluggish since the pandemic, with cinemas failing to get as many people through the door as they had pre-Covid. It\u2019s true that the Oscars have never been about box office receipts. But Barbie became a true cultural phenomenon. It resurrected cinema and if that isn\u2019t enough to win a statuette, I don\u2019t know what is. And there\u2019s a good reason why people turned up in droves, dressed up in pink, to watch Barbie and then returned for multiple viewings. That\u2019s because it is a genuinely great film; one of the most offbeat, subversive and surreal blockbusters that we\u2019ve seen in recent times. Barbie\u2019s journey towards self-realisation, when she crosses over into the real world, takes in feminism, sexism and toxic masculinity, but does so in a way that is still playful and always humorous. And most importantly, Barbie is fun. So much fun! Gerwig and Noah Baumbach\u2019s script is stacked with jokes that sparkle as fiercely as Barbie\u2019s gold disco jumpsuit. Surely it merits a win for its sardonic jibe at Zack Snyder\u2019s cut of Justice League alone? And the brilliant ensemble cast, which includes America Ferrera, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, and Michael Cera, look as if they\u2019re having a ball. Their infectious energy beams like a warm glow from the screen. Margot Robbie is the beating heart of Barbie, playing the character with endearing wide-eyed wonder as she grapples with burgeoning self-awareness. While Ryan Gosling throws himself into his role as the lovelorn, eternally sidelined Ken, whose sharply defined abs, love for horses and slick dance moves aren\u2019t quite enough to win her over. It\u2019s one of the funniest performances of 2023, and his \u201cI\u2019m Just Ken\u201d dance number, a homage to Singin\u2019 in the Rain, is just sublime. For all its strengths, let\u2019s not kid ourselves that Barbie is anything but an outsider when it comes to best picture. Barbie may have successfully overthrown a patriarchal revolution from the Kens in Barbie Land, but the Academy is an even harder institution to shake up. I worry that Barbie is emitting some serious \u201cKenergy\u201d as a contender; despite supporting the industry so handsomely financially, it\u2019s not really being taken that seriously. Some have noted how it plays out more like an extended advert for Mattel. But as Barbie\u2019s success shows, you should never underestimate it; beyond its good looks (Those gorgeous costumes! Those incredible sets!) and high-spirited charm, it\u2019s an endlessly inventive, smart and daring comedy tour de force that is more than worthy of any awards. So, even though it\u2019s likely to be Oppenheimer announced on the night, I hope that the Academy realises that it\u2019s time to trade in gold statuettes for plastic dolls and celebrate the film that brought much-needed joy, laughter and crowds back to the cinema.",

The European Commission presented its new European Defence Industry Strategy and a proposal for a European Defence Industry program. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said that the strategy \u201cwill support Member States to not only spend more, but better, together and European.\u201d Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, said \u201cRussia war of aggression has brought a great sense of urgency to step up our industrial defence capacities.\u201d Thierry Breton, the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, said boosting Europe\u2019s defence industrial base is of \u201cexistential\u201d importance and that the issue of financing will have to be discussed. Margrethe Vestager, the Commission\u2019s executive vice president, acknowledged that \u201c1.5 billion is not a lot of money when it comes to the defence industry \u2013 but it can still work as an incentive, as a bonus, as what makes member states come together.\u201d Guntram Wolff, a senior fellow at Bruegel, said that \u201cas usual it is a mix of aspiration and some concrete measures.\u201d Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), said \u201cthe most logical way forward is for the EU to just borrow the damn money through Eurobonds.\u201d CSIS\u2019 Mathieu Droin said the new European Defence Investment Strategy \u201cmight not be the silver bullet to solve the structural issues of the European defense industrial base, but it is a very positive development.\u201d The Hungarian foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, said in a press conference that his country would not support Mark Rutte, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, as Nato\u2019s next secretary-general. Mathieu Droin, a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us that the new European Defence Investment Strategy \u201cmight not be the silver bullet to solve the structural issues of the European defense industrial base, but it is a very positive development.\u201d \u201cIt sends important messages,\u201d he said. First to Ukraine and Russia, that EU military support for Ukraine is here to stay, and to expand. It is not a magical spell that puts the European industrial base \u2018in a war footing\u2019, on par with Russia, but it tells that Europe stands ready for a long war of attrition and to ultimately prevail over Russia. Second to the United States that, amid transatlantic uncertainties, Europeans are serious about taking their share of the burden, while giving a sense of European agency by complementing NATO\u2019s motto of \u2018spending more\u2019 with an injunction to \u201cspend better, together, and European\u201d. And, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a message to member states to finally get their acts together.\u201d As always success lies in the conversion from strategy to policies, and the EU has an uneven track record in this regard (cf. PESCO, Strategic Compass, Versailles agenda, etc.). Without sticks, it needs its carrots to be very attractive to get industries moving. As it stands, the goals set for 2030 seem ambitious (35% of intra-EU defense trade, 50% of EU procurement, 40% of collaborative procurement), but it is always better to start with a good level of ambition. The Hungarian foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, said today in a press conference that his country would not support Mark Rutte, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, as Nato\u2019s next secretary-general. Rutte, a longtime head of government, has already won the endorsement of Nato\u2019s biggest members. The Netherlands has over the past years been among the EU countries most vocal about concerns regarding democratic backsliding in Hungary. In 2020, Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, quipped: \u201cI don\u2019t know what is the personal reason for the Dutch prime minister to hate me or Hungary.\u201d And in a particularly tense summit in 2021, when tensions rose among leaders over a Hungarian anti-LGBT law, Rutte said Hungary must respect fundamental rights or leave. \u201cMy goal is to bring Hungary to its knees on this issue,\u201d he said at the time. Today, the Hungarian foreign minister appeared to refer back to these comments. \u201cWe certainly can\u2019t support the election of a person to the position of NATO\u2019s secretary general, who previously wanted to force Hungary on its knees,\u201d Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said. Speaking in Prague today, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said \u201cwe are certainly approaching a moment in our Europe where it will be appropriate not to be a coward,\u201d Reuters reported. He also said France and the Czech Republic were \u201cwell aware that war is back on our soil (in Europe), that some powers which have become unstoppable are extending every day their threat of attacking us even more, and that we will have to live up to history and the courage that it requires.\u201d Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at Bruegel, has shared with us his first impressions of the new European Defence Industrial Strategy. \u201cAs usual it is a mix of aspiration and some concrete measures,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a start, it is great that the EU Commission is putting forward a strategy. Europe gets way too little effective defence for how much it spends. European defence industry is fragmented and economies of scale are low,\u201d he said. Wolff also noted that \u201ca lot of defence equipment is bought abroad \u2013 with relatively little domestic production left. In the short term, Europe will need to continue to procure and buy globally as the domestic capacities to produce are still too limited to satisfy the needs of Ukraine. But domestic production is increasing \u2013 and needs to increase further.\u201d Addressing the Commission\u2019s aim to have a certain percentages of defence industrial production to be completed within the EU, Wolff said: While I have been very sceptical of such targets in the EU\u2019s green industrial strategy, I am more open to it in the case of defence. After all, this is a core area of sovereignty where foreign dependencies may be real security vulnerabilities. But he also that the proposed European Defence Industry Programme \u201clooks like a disappointing instrument to shore up domestic production in the short term.\u201d The planned \u20ac1.5 billion for 2025-27, he said, \u201cis very small compared to defence spending and unlikely to have a big impact.\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the Commission\u2019s executive vice president, acknowledged at the press conference that \u201c1.5 billion is not a lot of money when it comes to the defence industry \u2013 but it can still work as an incentive, as a bonus, as what makes member states come together.\u201d She added: \u201cThe real funding for a stronger defence comes from member states. And that funding will increase over the years to come. So what we can do here is to enable that funding to be spent in a better way, that we get more value for money, and that more relatively speaking is being spent in Europe as well.\u201d \u201cWith war on our borders, if not now, then when?\u201d she said. Thierry Breton, the EU\u2019s internal market commissioner, has emphasised that boosting Europe\u2019s defence industrial base is of \u201cexistential\u201d importance and that the issue of financing will have to be discussed. The European Investment Bank should change the way it works, he argued, to underpin the investments for production and development in the defence sector. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president who is expected to get a second term after June\u2019s EU election, said that the defence industrial strategy presented today \u201cwill support Member States to not only spend more, but better, together and European.\u201d It will also \u201clink Ukraine\u2019s know-how with our defence industry to facilitate innovation,\u201d she said. Speaking to reporters, the internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said that there is no talk of taking away from member states competencies on defence and that there is no talk of changing the EU Treaties. Along with the new strategy, the Commission has proposed a European Defence Industry Programme to \u201cbridge from short-term emergency measures, adopted in 2023 and ending in 2025, to a more structural and longer-term approach to achieve defence industrial readiness,\u201d the Commission said in a statement. The programme will mobilise \u20ac1.5 billion of the EU budget for 2025-2027. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, said during the presentation of the Commission\u2019s new strategy that \u201cpeace is no more a given\u201d and \u201cthe Russia war of aggression has brought a great sense of urgency to step up our industrial defence capacities.\u201d The European Commission has now presented its new European Defence Industry Strategy and a proposal for a European Defence Industry program. Speaking to reporters, Margrethe Vestager, the Commission\u2019s executive vice-president, said the move is designed to \u201crespond to the changes of Europe\u2019s security paradigm.\u201d The Commission said the new strategy is aimed at \u201csupporting a more efficient expression of the Member States\u2019 collective defence demand\u201d as well as \u201csecuring the availability of all defence products\u201d and \u201censuring that national and EU budgets support with the necessary means the adaptation of the European defence industry to the new security context.\u201d Goals also include \u201cmainstreaming a defence readiness culture across policies, notably by calling for a review of the European Investment Bank\u2019s lending policy this year\u201d and \u201cdeveloping closer ties with Ukraine through its participation in Union initiatives in support of defence industry and stimulating cooperation between the EU and Ukrainian defence industries.\u201d The Commission\u2019s plan also sets new indicators to measure progress. These include procuring \u201cat least 40% of defence equipment in a collaborative manner by 2030\u201d and \u201cmake steady progress towards procuring at least 50% of their defence procurement budget within the EU by 2030 and 60% by 2035.\u201d The EU is proposing its first ever EU defence industrial strategy today in an urgent bid to rebuild capacity to fend off potential future attacks from Russia. The move will mark the end of post-war peacetime defence strategy in Europe which has seen production of ammunition and battlefield hardware such as tanks being wound down. It also comes five years after Emmanuel Macron suggested a European army and after recent warnings by the French president and others that the EU had to become independent in its defence particularly with the prospect of Donald Trump coming to office in November. Officials at the European Commission said they were able to \u201cremedy\u201d the lack of a defence policy in the last two years but had identified three gaps, including a large financial black hole. Officials calculated that if the bloc had spent 2% of its GDP on defence in the last 15 years it would have spent \u20ac1trn. \u201cThis gives an idea of the financial realisation\u201d that is needed, said an insider. Immediate funds it is hoping to secure on joint agreement of member states is \u20ac1.5bn but defence commissioner Thierry Breton has talked about the need for a budget of \u20ac100bn. Officials said the new strategy was \u201cground breaking and adds quite considerable ambition\u201d to the hastily put together defence strategy that has been put in place in the wake of Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine and largely dominated by bigger states such as Germany in bilateral contributions. The strategy is also designed to give defence manufacturers in Europe and elsewhere the commercial confidence there will be orders in place long beyond the end of the war in Ukraine. The EU has recently been criticised by Ukraine for missing a target of supplying 1m rounds of ammunition by spring. This is now expected to be met at the end of the year. Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told the Guardian this morning that \u201cthis is a very important moment for not just the EU but for NATO and European security.\u201d \u201cEuropean defence is in a disastrous state not just because European countries don\u2019t spend enough but because they don\u2019t coordinate their spending,\u201d he said. Bergmann added: This means European defence is far less than the sum of its parts. The EU can therefore play a critical role in doing what the EU does best: breaking down barriers to cooperation and getting Europeans to actually coordinate on what they buy. NATO doesn\u2019t do this and the end result is a bunch of European militaries that struggle to deploy and fight together. But like some EU capitals, he also cautioned about the question of money. The big issue though is funding. 1.5 billion euros is not going to cut it. The EU has to incentivise cooperation and needs 10x that. The most logical way forward is for the EU to just borrow the damn money through Eurobonds. It\u2019s stunning that Estonia and Poland are supportive. The key obstacle is Berlin though, which seems opposed to any funding at the EU level, which is astonishingly shortsighted. The European Commission will hold a press conference to present the new European Defence Industrial Strategy and European Defence Industry Programme. Stay tuned for updates. The European Commission is set to present today its new European Defence Industrial Strategy. The move comes at a time when Ukraine is experiencing a serious ammunition shortage, and as European countries grapple with the question of what Donald Trump\u2019s possible return to the White House could mean for both Kyiv and transatlantic security commitments. But while for the most part there is agreement in Europe that it needs to step up on defence, and that defence production needs to urgently be ramped up, there are still divergences in views on how to get there \u2013 and in particular on how to fund new defence efforts. The strategy unveiled today is thus expected to be one milestone in a long policy debate. Estonia, France and Poland have issued a call for \u201curgently\u201d increasing Europe\u2019s defence readiness. In a document seen by the Guardian, the three countries outlined their priorities for the new European Defence Industrial Strategy. \u201cWe must ensure that the ambition of the Strategy is proportionate and backed by concrete actions that support our combat capability,\u201d they said, adding: \u201cwe are in a race against time.\u201d The three countries said the strategy should aim to: \u2022 Improve the long-term capacity of EU defence industry to provide for the needs of our armed forces, reduce strategic dependencies, and enhance the ability to scale up production quickly in times of crises; \u2022 Support a fundamental increase in Member States\u2019 levels of battle-decisive munition stocks, availability of key weapon systems and other capabilities across domains; \u2022 Enhance the EU\u2019s and its Member States\u2019 competitive edge in (military and dual-use) technology and innovation, including by removing bottlenecks, securing supply chains, and improving access to growth finance; \u2022 Strengthen cooperation with and encourage Ukraine\u2019s participation in its defence industrial initiatives. They also warned about the need for sufficient funding to go with ambitious goals. We call upon the Commission to present concrete funding options, especially for the period leading up to the next [long-term EU budget]. Inadequate funding now will only mean higher expenditure at a later date. The Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said this morning that \u201cwe have to unlock the potential of the European defence industry.\u201d We must learn lessons from the war in Ukraine and invest in the security of Europeans, fight fragmentation by joint arms procurement and promote cross-border production. The defence sector must have access to significant public and private finance and investment. She also reiterated a call for the creation of a dedicate defence commissioner in the next European Commission. Good morning and welcome back to the Europe blog. Today we will be looking into Europe\u2019s latest discussions on how to boost defence \u2013 and in particular the production of weapons and ammunition.

        "body": "I love my boyfriend very dearly and I know he loves me. I have no anxiety in my relationship. But, after two years, I have recently felt uninterested in sex, probably because in comparison with me he is \u201cvanilla\u201d. I would never dream of leaving him and would rather suppress my own sexual desire to solve the issue. Many couples reach an impasse in their sexual connection because sex becomes predictable and loses the erotic spark, or because underlying relationship issues hinder the loving connection. In your case, you have made a broad assumption: do you really know your boyfriend is 100% vanilla? Or that he would not respond to something less mainstream? Since you have erotic interests outside the conventional realm why not introduce him gently to them? Intimacy requires the sharing of what arouses each of you, what your specific needs are and, especially, your creative ideas to spice it up. Initiate!

        "body": "It was my first week as a fully fledged teacher. Pinned up next to my sixth-form college whiteboard, the neatly coloured timetable told me that the AS literature group were next. They milled around outside the classroom, brimming with nervy start-of-term small talk: how vast the site was compared with the various secondary schools they\u2019d said goodbye to a few months ago; stuttered lists of subject choices. I opened YouTube on my monitor, increased the volume and beckoned the students in. Twenty bemused kids made their way to their seats as I clicked to the beat at my desk, before rising to my feet to offer a laid-back two-step. I got a quizzical thumbs up; one brave soul testingly called out: \u201cYeah, funky, sir?\u201d As they peeled out of their box-fresh hoodies, Fela Kuti\u2019s Water No Get Enemy strolled towards its chorus. Playing \u201ccool tunes\u201d as students filed in was one of many gimmicks I used at the start of my teaching career, all of which now seem utterly laughable. But back in 2011, I was a bushy-tailed, 26-year-old newly qualified teacher (NQT), thrilled to have my first job at an \u201coutstanding\u201d college in genteel Surrey. I was keen to be one of those maverick, anti-authoritarian English teachers. Riding high on the idealism of my PGCE course (one of our more memorable seminars was on \u201cTeacher as clown\u201d), I wanted my democratic classroom to be an extension of the students\u2019 common room: a place for relatable but fiery intellectual debate. Informality and eccentricity were to be mainstays of my approach, too. I referred to my students as \u201cmy lambs\u201d, I playfully called myself \u201ctheir shepherd\u201d, and sheep puns were scattered throughout their worksheets. We played elaborate versions of bingo to help memorise literary terms. I only just managed to stop myself dressing up as a wizened matriarch to better deliver a lecture on Lorca\u2019s The House of Bernarda Alba. The students were remarkably tolerant and humoured my efforts. These flourishes might have been seen as a little odd, but they weren\u2019t wildly out of place: the college\u2019s spirit was fairly open, progressive. The head of classics had the classroom above mine and she cried whenever she read Homer aloud to her classes. Teachers were referred to by their first names, dress codes for staff were relaxed: scuffed Converse abounded. We English teachers were given autonomy in terms of text choices and how we explored them. Initial analyses of characters in King Lear often centred on the question: in your opinion, which of the three sisters would be most fun on a night out? With all that freedom, I was very much at home. And I soon sensed that students felt at home with me, too. At break times, the ambitious ones were relaxed when talking to me about their intractable perfectionism. The perennially disorganised ones shared their frustrations about always being on the back foot. My goal was to be nonjudgmental as we solved problems together and \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 to perhaps even make the kids laugh. Teacher as compassionate clown, perhaps. But I was not so comfortable or at home that I was able to tell my students I was gay. Even when studying The Picture of Dorian Gray, where discussion of my own, personal thoughts about Wilde\u2019s experience of outsiderhood might actually have been pertinent \u2013 illuminating, even \u2013 I kept shtum. * * * Even though I had come out to my English department colleagues, I never talked to them about this particular reticence, this fear of speaking freely with my classes. Strange, given that we were a pretty collegiate bunch, staffroom chat veering between updates on The Archers, family strife and triumphs, Yeats\u2019s tangled love life, sweary but precise takedowns of Gove\u2019s Gradgrindian vision. Strange, given that I felt so warmly towards them, these more experienced teachers who were sharing so much with me about how to survive successive weeks with 30 hours of lessons and 20 hours of marking. From the vantage point of 2024, when the Equality Act supposedly legislates against discrimination for a person\u2019s sexual orientation, and popular culture \u2013 Heartstopper, Sex Education \u2013 represents the classroom as a queer-friendly space, my reticence seems archaic, incongruous. I\u2019m disappointed in my former self, too. Isn\u2019t our aim as teachers not just to impart knowledge or to get young people through exams, but to model positive adult behaviours \u2013 like self-belief and pride? At the time, I was deeply frustrated about this for other reasons, too; angry about the unspoken imperative often placed on queer people to repeatedly \u201ccome out\u201d in each new social context, as if we owe this information to those around us; as if this self-revelation is always an easy and untroubling thing to do. While it was galling, I also understood my hesitation. Perhaps, I thought, there was something inherently pragmatic about the choice to keep sexuality private. Why did students need to know about teachers\u2019 personal lives? Where was that a requirement on any mark scheme? I had no precedent for how to have these sorts of conversations with pupils. When I had been at school in the late 90s and early 00s, no teacher ever told us they were gay. Section 28 of the Local Government Act, which prohibited the \u201cpromotion\u201d of homosexuality in schools was only repealed in 2003 \u2013 the year I did my A-levels. And I don\u2019t think my teachers should have felt compelled to reveal their sexuality \u2013 indeed, the National Education Union suggests to its LGBTQ+ members that the decision to come out at work \u201cis yours and yours alone\u201d. Still, there were frenzied whisperings about a couple of science teachers. When I was in year 9, the arrival of a young maths teacher who favoured unfeasibly tight trousers heralded playground speculation about his sexuality, but nothing more than that. On some level, I reckon that, for me, a version of internalised homophobia was at play. Some deeply held, inner sense absorbed from the world around me that my gayness, in the classroom context, was inappropriate and unprofessional. A fear that, once \u201crevealed\u201d, it would undermine me and become the sole focus of students\u2019 interactions with me. I would be \u201cthat gay teacher\u201d, and nothing more. * * * Five years later, I found myself teaching in a very different setting: a south London sixth-form college euphemistically described in some quarters as \u201cvibrant\u201d and in others as \u201cchallenging\u201d. Nominally, it was a Roman Catholic college. A little crucifix was nailed to the wall of every classroom, often flipped and made wonky by lively jokers as they sauntered out of lessons. Many of the students had been on free school meals at their previous schools. Something like 50 different languages were spoken across the predominantly Black student body. It was rated as \u201crequires improvement\u201d by Ofsted in 2017, a year after I joined the staff. I arrived with my kooky shepherd shtick, but there was no perky lambiness about this lot. Initially, my buoyancy and bags of brightly coloured tricks were met with scowls at best. It didn\u2019t take me long to understand why. The majority of my lessons were for GCSE resits. A lot of the kids in these groups had attempted the English exam three or four times and not reached the threshold grade C. Most of them had studied Of Mice and Men so often that they could recite whole chunks of it with glazed eyes. And here I was, serving up the same tired old stuff that no amount of bells and whistles could redeem. Their ire for Curley\u2019s wife knew no bounds. I did not blame them. Praise is a powerful thing. I should have recognised it sooner, but it became clear that what many of these young people were lacking was acknowledgment of their achievements \u2013 in whatever form they took. So, however exhausted or bored I was with trotting out tasks about differences between \u201ctheir\u201d and \u201cthere\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d, I made a point to incorporate some tiny sense of congratulation. Perhaps the group had been quieter than they were last week. Perhaps they\u2019d been more vocal \u2013 more responsive to questions. Maybe someone had spoken sensitively about Lennie\u2019s dialogue. Whatever good I could see and that felt important, I tried to acknowledge. And, even if they found it a little corny, the understanding that I was actively looking for goodness, that I wasn\u2019t just another person loudly putting them down, enabled the beginnings of rapport between me and some of the more willing students. Even so, the seemingly difficult business of my coming out to students remained. This time, the issue was complicated by race. As a Black gay man, then in my early 30s, I had had countless experiences of covert and overt homophobia from my community. At the barber\u2019s I went to in Brixton, I clenched and winced each time a fellow customer called someone a \u201cbattyman\u201d. The slur passed entirely unremarked on \u2013 in fact it was usually accompanied by gales of approving laughter. And, not far from that barber\u2019s, I had had stones thrown at me by homophobes from a car window (I don\u2019t know why they picked me out). So I was wary of talking to my largely Black classes, who were merciless with each other about things as ridiculous as a misremembered Rihanna lyric, about something that seemed as sensitive and incendiary as my sexuality. Then came a moment where something shifted. After a session with my fizzy English language group had ended, one of the students walked back into the room. What had she forgotten? It was lunchtime. I had four million things to do, I was at my desk sorting out my next PowerPoint, dashing off emails, writing reports, gobbling the canteen\u2019s speciality: a pallid ham sandwich. This ambling student, let\u2019s call her Annie, was chatting loudly on her mobile \u2013 totally against college rules \u2013 as she blithely trotted through the door and approached me. Annie mouthed a \u201cSorry\u201d, indicating with a finger that I should wait a minute. I rolled my eyes, crossed my arms. She moved the phone from her ear and met my eyes: \u201cYou\u2019re gay, innit, sir?\u201d There was something disarming about the directness. I blinked, swallowed a hunk of bread, nodded. \u201cCos I\u2019m just chatting to my friend, he\u2019s Nigerian \u2013 you\u2019re Ghanaian, innit sir?\u201d I nodded again. \u201cHe\u2019s basically about to tell his parents, and I was just saying to him he should, because it\u2019ll be completely OK \u2013 because you\u2019re completely OK, innit sir?\u201d I nodded again \u2013 at her, at the sandwich. Annie thanked me and bounded off, utterly unfazed. I was in shock. Angry, too, that I had been caught so off-guard and that the opportunity to decide how I would raise the issue been taken from me. Surely Annie was going to tell all the other kids? And surely any frail cordiality would be replaced by chaos \u2013 lessons were going to be impossible, unbearable now? * * * The next day, I began my class with Annie\u2019s group \u2013 a rather technical session about toddlers\u2019 tentative first attempts at speech \u2013 feeling pretty tentative myself. But the gossiping I expected did not materialise. Annie seemed to pay much more attention than she usually did. She worked hard, and not once did she even think to scrabble in her bag for her phone. It strikes me now that this was a missed opportunity. Not just to speak openly about myself, but to have a broader conversation about sexuality, and to stand against any homophobia that might come. A door had been opened. What stopped me from walking through and moving forward? Some intuition that I shouldn\u2019t go too far and that, on this occasion, I\u2019d had a lucky escape. This anxiety followed me to my next teaching appointment. This third school, in 2017, had me leaping into a different milieu once again. It was a highly selective, fee-paying girls\u2019 school in west London. I was doing a maternity cover and had been given, among other things, a sixth-form tutor group to look after. As this was an independent school, the class was tiny \u2013 only 10 students. They were fantastic, wise beyond their years, but prodigiously silly, too: for me, an ideal combo. Interesting, chatty, inquisitive, they came to me every morning, for a least 45 minutes, at registration. Those conversations were often the highlights of my day. The girls steered me through the social peculiarities and history of this particular school, beaming as they regaled me with tales of errant head girls and questionable RE teachers. They were weirdly obsessed with Abba and musical theatre, and introduced me to a phenomenon called RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, which I hadn\u2019t a clue about before their hyperactive recommendations. As they sorted out their Ucas forms, I shared stories of my own university high jinks. I was open with them about the strangeness of being in this world of extreme privilege after my last job. There was a lot of interest in my writing, the nervous wait for the publication of my first novel. At parents\u2019 evenings, their mothers and fathers talked about how lucky their daughters felt to have me as a form tutor. My ego did somersaults. Despite all this, I again drew the line at talking to them about my gayness, and more specifically the fact that I was now engaged to my partner of a decade. This was in spite of there being a few happily \u201cout\u201d teachers at the school, an institution that prized itself on its liberal ethos. Again the intersection of race and sexuality had something to do with my keeping quiet. At the time, I was the school\u2019s only Black member of teaching staff. Because of \u201ccolour-blindness\u201d, fear of causing offence, not wanting to be seen as focusing exclusively and detrimentally on my Blackness, I\u2019m not sure, but my racial difference was never meaningfully acknowledged by my colleagues in my early days there. To be fair, I didn\u2019t raise it, either. This conspicuous silence made me feel as if my Blackness was enough of an awkward aberration. I didn\u2019t want to mark myself out any more by bringing my queerness into lessons. Besides, I was otherwise, to use Annie\u2019s assessment, \u201ccompletely OK\u201d. Settled and liked and doing well in a well-paid role. A permanent position was very much on the cards. What was the hardship in not telling the kids about my wider life? It didn\u2019t matter all that much. * * * Christmas parties are always decisive, aren\u2019t they? At my first festive bash at the school, the flamboyant drama assistant and I had a shouty conversation on the dancefloor about the sexiness of the gay romance in the film God\u2019s Own Country. We talked, too, about students we both taught \u2013 listing off names, comparing notes. He\u2019d had some rehearsals with a few of the girls in my tutor group. He wondered if I had come out to them. I said no. Embarrassment pricked my cheeks as I registered his surprise. He spoke about how he had discussed his sexuality with his sixth formers, and how much he had enjoyed giving advice to the school\u2019s LGBTQ+ society. Comparatively, I felt like a \u201cbad gay\u201d. I talked about my reservations. While he listened empathetically, he also asked me to consider how much it might mean to a possibly queer student in my group to hear me \u2013 someone they looked up to and respected \u2013 speaking honestly about myself. He asked me to imagine what it would have been like for me at school if a gay teacher had opened up about themselves. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what difference that scenario would have made to me. But it would have been an important part of my path towards understanding and delighting in my gayness. The next morning, I had my last registration of the term with my tutor group. They were singing Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas Is You and getting themselves in a tizzy about the year 12 secret Santa. Mutterings about university acceptance letters expected in early January were feverish. I asked them about their Christmas plans. They wanted to know mine. The conversation with the drama assistant was still with me \u2013 rallying and comforting. Maybe it was the festive hangover, or the last-day-of-term devil-may-care spirit, but I told them I was spending Christmas day itself with my partner\u2019s family. It was sure to be a noisy affair because his family was so large. \u201cHe\u2019s one of seven brothers \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely mad,\u201d I told them. They registered the pronoun. It hung in the air between us. The girls looked at each other, warmly. What I remember most about that aside that morning, and the quiet seconds that followed, was how natural it all felt. Despite it being years in the making, and the subject of so much agonising, there was no sense of effortful force or adrenalised fear. No huge sense of release or relief, either. Only a lightness and absolute ordinariness to the moment, to their silent smiling. I was smiling, too. Curious about what, if anything, might happen next. Pleased, yes, that as the drama assistant had said, I might now be able to offer solidarity to students in need. But mostly proud, now, to be shepherding myself. \u2022 Michael Donkor\u2019s novel Grow Where They Fall is published by Fig Tree (\u00a316.99).

        "body": "On a property out of Tamworth in country New South Wales, the uncle of the Australian shepherd Viking \u2013 winner of the most prestigious title at the 2024 Crufts dog competition in the UK \u2013 is a champion in his own right. Bradley, who was born in Russia to the same litter as Viking\u2019s mother, is nine years old and a semi-retired multi-champion of dog shows overseas and in Australia. \u201cI fell in love with Bradley when I saw that photo of him as a baby in the snow and had to own him,\u201d breeder Paulene Andrews said. Andrews, who has been a registered dog breeder in Tamworth for 26 years, co-owned Bradley until he was old enough to safely travel to Portugal, where he gained multiple titles before moving permanently to Australia to continue his show career. It was down under that Bradley won best in show over three consecutive years \u2013 2018, 2019 and 2020 \u2013 gaining his Australian supreme championship. Four years later, Bradley\u2019s niece has been crowned the same award but at the world\u2019s biggest dog show \u2013 beating more than 19,000 other dogs from around the world. Dog shows in Australia are run by Dogs Australia, which hosts events around the country almost every weekend. The best in show award is \u201cwhere the dog is showing the attributes of the best breed type\u201d, Lyn Brand, president of Dogs NSW (the state member of Dogs Australia), said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In other words, it\u2019s a beauty contest. Or as Brand put it, \u201clike a classic car collection\u201d. \u201cWhen you see people out there on the weekend with their cars that they\u2019ve spent hours and hours of work on \u2026 It\u2019s a bit like us breeders. It\u2019s a passion and we put a lot into breeding certain lines and trying to produce the best of the best and then we go out and compete against other people from other kennels.\u201d Australian shepherds have become extremely successful in the show ring because of their \u201ceye-catching colours\u201d and \u201ceffortless, powerful movements\u201d, Brand said. They are built to do some herding, have a little bit of guarding instinct, are a loyal companion and should be able to work all day, Brand said, but also are beautiful to look at. Andrews agreed: \u201cThey are just stunning dogs and their temperament is just so well behaved. \u201cThey are also an extremely smart dog that wants to please you all the time. They really are soft dogs.\u201d The colours of Australian shepherds vary from blue merle and red merle (patterned colours) to black and red. Viking, who won the top prize, is a blue merle. Contrary to their name, Australian shepherds are not originally from Australia. It is widely believed they come from the US, where they were bred as sheepdogs to work on ranches, but other accounts suggest a more complicated lineage. Shirley and Jeff Ford are recorded as the first to reintroduce the breed to Australia in the 1990s, when they emigrated from England. By January 1994, the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) officially recognised the Australian shepherd, which are now one of the largest in the working dog group. Herding and working dogs are having a moment. Messi the dog \u2013 a seven-year-old border collie in Justine Triet\u2019s Anatomy of a Fall \u2013 stole the show at Oscars on Sunday night when he sat among the industry\u2019s best to cheer on the winners of the night. Andrews\u2019 Australian shepherds like to \u201crun around in the morning, play, get fed and then they\u2019re not that active all day\u201d. She has bred them that way so they make better pets. \u201cWhat\u2019s a bit disappointing in this country is, after Covid, people bought Australian shepherds off people who were obviously back yard breeding and don\u2019t know the genetics or required health tests for quality and safe breeding.\u201d Dog breeders in NSW must pass an examination based on the upkeep of dogs, the breeding of dogs and then premises are inspected to see if you are suitable enough to rear a litter, Brand said. After the Crufts competition, organisers said \u201cthe health and welfare of dogs at our show is our priority\u201d. The statement came amid backlash after a French bulldog which some argued had no discernible nostrils, was awarded the best canine in the utility group.",

Catupatree That was one of my first jobs out of drama school. I think Anthony Hopkins was brilliant. I\u2019d like to know when that quote was from. When we were filming it, I was only 20 years old and having the time of my life in Tahiti with 200 gorgeous extras. I know that Anthony had problems with Roger Donaldson, the director. I don\u2019t know whether it was artistic \u2013 I was enjoying myself too much to pay attention \u2013 but in my opinion it ended up being a really good film. They must have patched things up because they went on to do The World\u2019s Fastest Indian together. I\u2019d be interested to know what Tony \u2013 as he\u2019s known to the glitterati \u2013 thinks of it now. You grew up in care homes. Does the story of I Am Urban resonate with your own experiences? Sirriv69 Very much so. It\u2019s a story we see over and over \u2013 the neglect of children by parents who have addiction problems and find it difficult to operate in society. All of that resonates. I was in care, whereas in I Am Urban, the boy is passed around between care homes and foster parents. If you\u2019ve been in care, it\u2019s almost like having been in the army. There is a camaraderie with other people who have experienced it to whatever degree. I\u2019ve always felt it wasn\u2019t that bad for me. You had certain freedoms taken away from you, but I\u2019ve more than made up for it in adult life. I always had my eye on the future, something which is taken away from some of the people in I Am Urban. So it did resonate very heavily. Hunting Venus was great. Did you enjoy being a woman and how difficult did it prove during filming? Prestonian79 It was difficult from the start. I had to be in makeup at 4am because it was a full prosthetic. I was pretty slim at the time, 32 waist, but the corset brought it down to something crazy like 22 or 24in, so it was really uncomfortable. When I took it off at the end of the day, I could feel my organs all slipping back into place. Walking in heels also made me empathise. But playing a woman was great. I had men \u2013 these big, big hairy grips \u2013 flirting with me on set. At one point I had to tell people to keep their hands off my breasts. I said: \u201cI know they\u2019re not real, but they\u2019re still mine.\u201d After filming, I asked if I could keep them but I wasn\u2019t sure what to do with them so I used them as doorstops. Then the silicone started to deteriorate and stain my carpet, so they ended up in the recycling. How do you feel about not being asked to voice the lead in the forthcoming Bob the Builder movie? If Anthony Ramos mucks it up, and producer Jennifer Lopez calls and says: \u201cIs it to late to repair the damage?\u201d what would you say? Paul_Rangecroft I\u2019d say: \u201cWell, my price has now gone up, Jenny.\u201d I\u2019ve no idea what this movie is going to be. Stop-frame animation? CGI? Jenny, get on the phone and let\u2019s have a little chat. I was chatting to Kate Harbour, who plays Wendy, the other day. We said that the entire original Bob crew should at least be invited to the British premiere. It was a labour of love. When we started, they were making it in a 12 x 8ft studio, and it would take a month to animate 10 minutes. By the end, we had a warehouse in Manchester with more than 200 animators, making 12 seconds per team a day. God bless Peter Orton, the original producer, who died. Then it was picked up by a big US toy company and became about making toys, as opposed to the lovely cottage industry of how it started off. So I could at least teach JLo some of the history. Do you find it gratifying that you have had two UK No 1 singles, while Morrissey has had none? VerulamiumParkRanger Poor bloke. I do actually feel gratified. It was a turn in my career I never expected. I ended up vicariously on Top of the Pops, even though it was a Bob animation. But listen, Morrissey is still making music, so he can keep trying. Boon was just brilliant. So many talented people. What was it like working with Michael Elphick? Could it ever be remade? Tryggo and pleicetene Michael Elphick was a dream, a great mentor and friend. He taught me so much about film craft. We used to play this game where, by judging the distance from your mark to the lens, you could guess the width of the frame. We\u2019d play for a fiver. He smashed me for years and took hundreds of pounds off me. When I started getting it right, he went: \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d and stopped. Could they ever bring it back? I suppose I would be the older biker bloke now. I wonder if they\u2019d make me grow my hair? I started getting fed up with having helmet hair every time I took a helmet off because they wouldn\u2019t let me cut it. Ever fancied doing a follow-up to Men Behaving Badly but as a midlife crisis dramatic piece? Kellysahero1970 That\u2019s my life already! All they need to do is film me as if it\u2019s a documentary. Would you ever write your autobiography or has Peter Serafinowicz put you off? TopTramp I think Peter is the only person out there who does an impersonation of me. It\u2019s very funny. I must be his fallback impersonation, making me look a bit dim, which is very sweet. It hasn\u2019t put me off. It\u2019s just a question of getting the timing right. What I don\u2019t want to do is write an autobiography and get sandwiched somewhere between \u2013 God bless them both, by the way \u2013 Katie Price and Wayne Rooney as a Christmas bargain bucket special. I\u2019d like to write about my life from somewhere near zero until about 18 when I got into drama school. And I can get Peter Serafinowicz to do the audio book, if he\u2019s not too busy doing Katie Price or Wayne Rooney. Do you think you\u2019ve received the recognition you deserve? AmongstTheWaves I\u2019m very happy. I\u2019m not a climb the ladder kind of person. I\u2019ve always just tried to go out there and do the best I can. I may have got caught up a little bit in the 90s with Men Behaving Badly thinking: \u201cNext up \u2013 Hollywood!\u201d But I think I\u2019ve had the appreciation. The best compliment is when you are employed. So when people employ me, I\u2019m happy, and that seems to be continuing to happen whether it\u2019s an animation comedy show, serious drama or a nice play in the West End. \u2022 I Am Urban is on digital platforms now",

        "body": "It\u2019s 10am and the sun is already bouncing hard off the Sydney Opera House forecourt where I\u2019m due to meet one of Australia\u2019s most prolific and awarded writers for stage and screen. David Williamson arrives on cue and is hard to miss. A head-and-something taller than the throng of sightseers and tour groups, he looms over the shirtless joggers gleaming in the sun and kids on bikes weaving through the crowds. He politely skirts past a photoshoot bride clutching an unruly bunch of sunburst dahlias. At 82, Williamson is an elder statesman of the theatre and in 2024, despite retiring several times in the past decade or so, he is very busy. His latest play, The Great Divide, is opening at Sydney\u2019s Ensemble theatre this week. Later in the year, another new play, The Puzzle, opens in Adelaide and another, Aria (directed by son Rory and starring son Felix), has an out-of-town season in Noosa before a season at the Ensemble in 2025. Williamson is the least retired 82-year-old you\u2019ll ever meet. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning \u201cI\u2019ve always loved walking around here, through the botanic garden, and up to Mrs Macquarie\u2019s Chair and into the art gallery before it gets too hot,\u201d says Williamson. On this occasion, however, we\u2019re already about an hour into \u201ctoo hot\u201d. \u201cSydney is a stunning city, but it\u2019s a young person\u2019s city,\u201d he says, eyeing off an empty bench in the middle distance. \u201cIt\u2019s almost unmanageable as you get older, just getting from A to B and finding a parking spot. It\u2019s an exciting city but you need a lot of energy.\u201d Today, Williamson confesses, \u201cI\u2019m functioning on about two cylinders\u201d. He loves walking but these days his exercise preference is a gentle morning swim in the lap pool at his home in Noosa. He\u2019s also recovering from a double whammy of Covid and influenza. \u201cI\u2019m still feeling the effects, but luckily I had all my vaccinations, otherwise, I think I might be dead by now,\u201d he says, bluntly. We agree that our planned walk through the botanic gardens will be a bit shorter than anticipated. Williamson towers over me \u2013 he\u2019s 2m tall \u2013 and he still has a tall man\u2019s stride. After a few minutes, I\u2019m relieved when he suggests we settle on a park bench shaded by tree ferns. Sydney Opera House looms large in the view, as it does in Williamson\u2019s career. Its theatres played host many of his biggest commercial triumphs in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. He was box office gold for Sydney Theatre Company, famous for holding up a mirror to upper middle-class Australian audiences and making them laugh at their reflection. Politicians, shock jocks, academics, real estate agents and art market speculators all copped a serve over the decades. Interesting aside: Madonna played an art dealer willing to strap on a dildo to please a client in his play Up for Grabs in London in 2002. Williamson is in town for the last few rehearsals and the opening night of The Great Divide, a story that pits a supermarket shelf-stacker against a property developer secretly buying up the town in order to turn it into an exclusive retirement/lifestyle destination. \u201cLike a lot of my plays, it was sparked by anger,\u201d says Williamson. \u201c[Economists] Friedman and Hayek told us we mustn\u2019t tax the rich, we must let them keep as much money as we can, because then they\u2019ll use all this money reinvested in productive industries, employ people, and all that wealth will trickle back down to us. In fact, it didn\u2019t. All that neoliberalism has done for us is made the top tier of Australians very wealthy.\u201d The Great Divide is a \u201cDavid v Goliath story\u201d he says, but from a realist\u2019s perspective. \u201cIn real life, Goliath always wins,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in a drama, you can tilt the balance a little bit.\u201d Has living in the white-shoe haven of Noosa mellowed him at all, then? \u201cOh, I still get fired up,\u201d he smiles. \u201cBy hypocrisy, by politicians on both sides telling us that we live in the greatest country on Earth yet won\u2019t do anything to address what\u2019s so obviously wrong with it. \u201cAustralian drama hasn\u2019t addressed inequality for 40 years! It\u2019s been obsessed with identity politics, which has brought many strong new writers, many good plays, but it has ignored the elephant in the room \u2013 that we are an unfair and unequal society. The notion of class, which is a huge factor in Australia, has totally disappeared from our stages.\u201d He did enjoy Sydney Theatre Company\u2019s The Picture of Dorian Gray, he says. \u201cThe technical wizardry, and the performance skills \u2026 amazing. But personally, Kris [his wife] and I were bored stiff. We know that story. I go to the theatre to see a story I don\u2019t know! \u201cAnd it was the same when STC did Jekyll and Hyde. Technical wizardry again and two of the finest actors in the country \u2013 but drama is not narrating a novel!\u201d Williamson has a theory. Maybe we\u2019re in a bread and circuses period? \u201cMaybe it\u2019s to offset the lure of the big 90-inch TV screens? It\u2019s like we\u2019re back in the days of [early 20th century impresario] Bland Holt. The staging and the wizardry of the sets were what the audience came to see. He used to stage Australian bushranger dramas with live horses on stage. He had an elephant on stage. The plays were pretty humdrum, but the effects were amazing and that\u2019s all people were interested in.\u201d Sitting here, Williamson seems to have got his breath back. I begin to suspect he can talk like this for hours. \u201cIt\u2019s getting like Hollywood,\u201d he says. \u201cHollywood will only do films whose stories have proved themselves in some other medium \u2013 like a book or in an earlier film. They will not risk an untried story. And theatres are becoming the same. It\u2019s all about adapting novels and director\u2019s theatre, that \u2018look at me, look at me\u2019 style. Pure playwriting has become, to some extent, ghettoised.\u201d He looks out at the harbour. A tall ship is gliding by. \u201cIt\u2019s actually very nice sitting here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m still a great believer in the words of the American playwright David Mamet, who, when asked why people came to the theatre, said it was to see what happens next. I love a situation where characters come on stage, you have no idea who they are, what they stand for, what their characters are like, what their conflicts are, and it unfolds in front of you. Theatre at its very best is enthralling, and I want people to experience that. I know it\u2019s old fashioned and we should have pyrotechnics, but I still feel drama is about unfolding characters and conflicts and that\u2019s what I try and do.\u201d Williamson gets a phone call: time\u2019s up. We say our goodbyes but, as always, he has more to say. Walking across the Opera House forecourt, my phone lights up with a message. It\u2019s Williamson. \u201cOne of Bland Holt\u2019s most famous plays was The Breaking of the Drought, in which he somehow managed to create a full-on flood onstage,\u201d he says in the text message. \u201cPerhaps ripe for revival at the Sydney Theatre Company?\u201d The Great Divide is playing at the Ensemble theatre in Sydney now, until 27 April.",

        "body": "Two Guardian Australia journalists have won the Quill award for excellence in Indigenous affairs reporting at the Melbourne Press Club awards. Nino Bucci and Blake Sharp-Wiggins won the coveted award for their investigation into pedestrian deaths in the Northern Territory. The investigation was picked for bringing to the reader\u2019s attention the \u201cstark details\u201d of the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in Northern Territory pedestrian deaths. Judges described the article, Lethal highways, as presenting a balanced use of statistical evidence, research findings and interviews that resulted in a feature that \u201cdemonstrates clearly a commitment on the part of the pair to deliver a comprehensive narrative without injecting editorial bias\u201d. \u201cImportantly for this particular category, Nino and Blake clearly seem to have addressed a sensitive and contentious topic with due respect to all parties involved,\u201d judges wrote. Guardian staff were also highly commended in two other categories. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The 29th Golden Quill award went to John Ferguson of the Australian for his exclusive story about the fatal Leongatha mushroom lunch in regional Victoria. Judges praised Ferguson\u2019s scoop, which was followed up with other exclusives, including an interview with the now-charged woman who hosted the lunch, for setting the agenda for a story which \u201cengaged Australians and the world\u201d. \u201cThis was a good old-fashioned scoop in one of the most competitive beats in this town, where nothing stays secret for long,\u201d judges wrote. The report of the lunch where three people died also won the scoop of the year. The ABC News Victoria team won best breaking news or live coverage for breaking the news of the premier Daniel Andrews\u2019 resignation, while the news reporting in writing award went to Aneeka Simonis of the Herald Sun for her coverage of family violence survivors. The 2023 Graham Perkin Australian journalist of the year award went to Neil Chenoweth and Edmund Tadros of the Australian Financial Review for their coverage of the PwC tax leaks scandal. Judges said in a story that dominated the news cycle last year, the duo\u2019s revelations led to the \u201cbreak-up of the accounting giant, the departure of the CEO and the biggest crackdown on misconduct by tax advisers in Australian history\u201d. Kai Feng, Jarrod Fankhauser, Olivia Ralph and Steven Viney of ABC News won the innovation in journalism award for their reportage into the evolution of sneaker brands. Guardian Australia\u2019s Jonathan Horn was highly commended in the same category for his commentary on the sporting media malaise. Charlotte Grieve of the Age won the award for reporting on disability issues for her reporting into the treatment of mental health crises, and the \u201cconsidered and respectful telling\u201d of the trauma associated with the use of restraints in mental health settings. Guardian Australia\u2019s Stephanie Convery was highly commended in the same category for her report \u2018Holding cell\u2019: Melbourne family with disabled son stuck in \u2018transitional\u2019 housing for a decade\u201d. The lifetime achievement award went to Jennifer Keyte of Channel Ten, for a \u201ccareer of accomplished journalism, presenting news across networks\u201d, and for being a \u201cpowerful role model\u201d for female journalists.",

        "body": "Monday Please make sure you are sitting down before I break this news to you. The Princess of Wales edited a photo of herself and her three children. It is thought she used several shots taken by her husband, a bald man, and sort of mushed them together to make a slightly better one. As a result, millions died. No, they didn\u2019t. But you would think they had, given the headlines, column inches and social media outrage that has been generated by a story best actually summed up as: \u201cThing that everyone does was done. By lady with nice hair.\u201d Can the monarchy survive? It probably can. Can the integrity of photojournalism? It probably can. Can respect for international press agencies endure? If such a thing still exists, yes. A misaligned zip and cardigan cuff are probably not going to be the stuff that brings it down. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. It\u2019s the biggest story of the week and it runs ALL week. We are officially insane as a country, and by the national madness individuals will surely be driven down the same path. The snake eats itself. Which makes me think that the conspiracy theorists are right. This isn\u2019t in fact the real Kate, returned from her \u201cplanned\u201d \u201cabdominal\u201d \u201csurgery\u201d, but Meghan in a Kate skinsuit, back to wreak revenge on us all for exiling her and her prince. It. All. Makes. Sense. Tuesday With the world still reeling from the Kate (Meghan!) photo revelations, it was rabbit-punched by the television presenter and current Celebrity Big Brother contestant Fern Britton, who revealed that she does not wear knickers or owt like that (I paraphrase slightly) under her jeans. I have questions for Fern Britton. I have questions for all ladies who do this. I have questions about chafing. I have questions about hygiene. I have questions, simply put, about whywhywhywhywhy?. But mostly I have questions about chafing. Those questions involve big seams, soft parts and the proximity and alignment thereof. I want answers, and then I want a cost-benefit analysis of what you\u2019re doing. What benefit are you reaping from the decision not to place one gloriously protective layer of cotton between yourself and what is essentially a serrated denim hellscape? So cheap! So easy! So surely saving you several washloads a week? Listen, this is at least as important as a wonky cardigan cuff, OK? Could we launch an investigation and cultural conversation stat, please? Wednesday I\u2019m so sorry but it\u2019s been a week of extraordinary blows and now I must deal you another one. For today it was revealed that vets are expensive. Not only that but it appears that those owned by large, profit-seeking consortiums are often more expensive than small, independent outfits. That they are not always interested in what is best for Fido or Felix but in what is best for the corporate bottom line. I know. I know. As the owner of two cats whom I love more than life itself (well, one of whom I love more than life itself \u2013 the other one and I are in talks) and who has certainly never, with panicked, desperate motions, shovelled cash in the direction of anyone assuring me that an expensive procedure is necessary to keep them from experiencing momentary discomfort, let alone from shuffling off this mortal coil, I am shocked. And as an upstanding member of western capitalist society I am appalled to learn that the profit motive could ever lead to unethical behaviour or any kind of corruption, major or minor. I have a lot of thinking to do now. A lot. Thursday As a little blessed light relief from these accumulating traumas comes the news that folk in Winchester are up in arms about the cathedral\u2019s decision to install a \u00a3100,000 Jane Austen statue in its Inner Close. Is their anger over the use of funds they feel should have been distributed among the poor and needy in accordance with good Christian practice? No (it was funded by private donations). Is it an offensive statue in some way? Has the sculptor Martin Jennings put her in a crop top and stood her on a pile of burned Pride and Prejudices in some kind of unfathomable Statement, as artists are so wearily prone to doing? No (she\u2019s standing in full Regency fig by her famous writing table). They are in fact afeard that it will turn Winchester into \u201cDisneyland-on-Itchen\u201d as tourists flock to come and take a selfie of themselves with the statue. What can you say but \u2013 no. No it won\u2019t, my pets. It\u2019ll be fine. Austen is buried in the cathedral. No one is going to say \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna see the grave of one of literature\u2019s greatest talents. But a statue? Of her standing up! Touching a smaller statue of her desk? Let\u2019s GO!\u201d Winchester will remain safely distinguishable from Disneyland for many years to come. Friday And so, would you credit it, we reach the end of Extremist Week. I\u2019m sorry, did you not know about the government\u2019s plan to leap back into pole position \u2013 or any poll position other than the one they currently occupy \u2013 by announcing a crackdown, no a real crackdown, grr, yes, on hate speech in public life. You were probably confused by the apologies of the Tory donor Frank Hester for his reported comments that Diane Abbott made him \u201cwant to hate all Black women\u201d and \u201cshould be shot\u201d, and the former Conservative deputy chair Lee Anderson\u2019s defection to the Reform party, with an accompanying speech about those who want to \u201cerase our history\u201d and \u201cgive our country away\u201d. Perhaps you thought \u2013 maybe like Anderson himself \u2013 that Extremism Week was a celebratory event, a chance to see how far we could all go. Like a verbal equivalent of The Purge. No. It was simply reality, gazing into the abyss of the Tory party, shaking its head and murmuring: \u201cWrong again, boys. Wrong again,\u201d while every satirist in town stared at a blank screen or piece of paper and wondered, not for the first time, what to do now.",

        "body": "Springtime for via ferrata, Lake Garda, Italy Spring in northern Lake Garda is an adventure paradise. I\u2019ve been several times and enjoyed the via ferratas: iron cables fixed to scrambling routes, which require fitness and sense of adventure but not technical mountaineering skills (safety equipment required). The views are amazing and varied, from gorges and ledges to grassy mountaintop finishes and, for the bold, huge vertical ladders \u2013 with castles, bastions and shrines along the route. It\u2019s a great area, too, for hiring a bike or picking one of the many apartments that include them, to explore the paths and see the lakes and mountains by pedal power. Bored with all that? There\u2019s also paddleboarding, windsurfing, swimming and river boat trips. All accompanied by brilliant food and gelato. David Thomas Spectacular by boat or bike, Lake District I\u2019ve enjoyed many perfect activity breaks around beautiful Keswick. Paddleboarding, kayaking and sailing on both Derwentwater and Bassenthwaite Lake are glorious \u2013 although you always have to be mindful of the no-boating zones set up to protect breeding birds. Once we have enough of the water we hire mountain bikes and enjoy various trails in Whinlatter Forest. The 16-mile Back o\u2019 Skiddaw route is a real wilderness ride. Hikers are spoilt for choice: my favourites include the nine-mile Coledale Horseshoe and the climb up Blencathra via Sharp Edge to get your pulse racing. The solitude and spectacular scenery make Dock Tarn, a few miles south of Derwentwater, perfect for a wild swim. Katharine High-level hiking in the Pyrenees, Andorra The Coronallacs Trail offers fantastic hut-to-hut hiking in the Pyrenees. The trail consists of five stages and covers 57 challenging but immensely rewarding miles (92km) passing remote mountain lakes and stunning vistas, reaching a high point of 2,900 metres above sea level. The route links all four of Andorra\u2019s staffed mountain refuges, which provide accommodation and food, allowing you to pack light. At 14 miles the fourth stage is the longest and the hardest, ending in a refuge on Andorra\u2019s highest mountain, Coma Pedrosa. Packages offering four nights\u2019 half-board accommodation at the huts can be found for about \u00a3180pp (\u20ac219.72) at stadesport.com. Jasper Exotic plants and winding paths, La Gomera, Canary Islands La Gomera in the Canary Islands is hikers\u2019 heaven. There\u2019s thrilling mountain scenery, superb waymarked trails, mild weather all year round and everywhere is so pristine and peaceful, without too many people. At times it\u2019s like walking on a winding path through an ornamental garden, with unusual plants at your feet but with spectacular mountain views all around. The island also has an excellent road network, which means you can abbreviate walks by taking taxis or buses at the start or finish. You still feel away from it all, though. I travelled with On Foot Holidays on a self-guided route with outstanding app and luggage transfer. Paul Kirkwood On wheels in Wales and looking out for warblers West Pembrokeshire is famed for plunging cliffs and turquoise water rising and falling in remote coves. But take to two wheels on a spring day and you can enjoy a whole field guide of inland wildlife. Traffic-free tarmac and infrequent climbs make this a viable destination for cyclists of all experience and abilities. The gorse hedges are as yellow as the cross on St David\u2019s flag in spring. Don\u2019t rush. Stop frequently to be rewarded by the first swallows and warblers arriving from Africa. Step carefully on sun-warmed ground where lizards and adders bask. As your ride concludes, recuperate in one of the uncrowded independent tearooms. Matthew Page A river trekking adventure, France My family and I went river tracing (also river trekking) in Les Gorges du Toulourenc in Dr\u00f4me in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, 25 miles east of Orange. It is a wonderful place to embrace physical activity and the beauty of nature simultaneously. The colour of the water \u2013 which is often around calf level, but goes up to above the waist in places \u2013 is an ethereal turquoise. With a bit of scrambling on rocks and swimming through deeper water there is enough challenge to feel like you\u2019re on a proper adventure, but you can also just sit quietly on the water\u2019s edge to take in the rocks leading up to sky and watch the rare Bonelli\u2019s eagles soaring high above. Jenny Ross The air is as sweet as wine in Portugal\u2019s Douro Valley There is no better place for a burst of spring energy and activity than the Douro Valley. The air is as sweet as the wine and the golden grapes by mid March \u2013 making it perfect for walking or cycling breaks. It\u2019s also pretty flat, as we discovered last year, making it accessible for the very old (in my case) and the very young (in my grandchildren\u2019s case). It\u2019s easily reached by train from Porto, and you can hire bikes for \u20ac20 a day or just walk. Swimming in the river \u2013 from one side to the other \u2013 is also fun. Make sure you visit Aveiro, ideally by boat, to check out its colourful houses cafes and streets. Gayle Our activity dreams came true in the Alps Before life with children, we headed to the French Alps for a multi-activity break with Responsible Travel (from \u00a3700pp excluding travel), sleeping in an off-grid yurt with a pick-and-mix menu of activities. We chose via ferrata, gorge walking, mountain biking and \u2013 a dream come true \u2013 paragliding! All the activities were easy to book. Cooking facilities were available on the farm; we also tried out local food markets and restaurants. We\u2019ll be heading back for more as soon as our small people are old enough to jump into cold rivers. Charlotte On the quiet route from Amsterdam to Brussels I booked a gentle six-day cycling holiday from Amsterdam to Brussels with Dutch Bike Tours (\u20ac889pp for two sharing, including breakfast), after taking the Eurostar to Amsterdam and then back from Brussels. It was a lovely, serene cycle trip that would be suitable for families, though I did it solo. Dutch Bike Tours took care of my luggage and booked hotels, leaving me to take in the quiet countryside and picturesque towns such as Gouda, Bergen op Zoom and Louvain at a pace of my choosing. The route is guided by a series of numbered \u201cjunctions\u201d and shows what cycling in the UK could be like. David Bryce Winning tip: my reservoir cycle in the Peak District We enjoyed a traffic-free cycle holiday based in the beautiful Peak District town of Bakewell. We warmed up on the flat, family-friendly 8.5-mile Monsal Trail, passing through spectacular limestone dales and over the amazing Headstone Viaduct. The Upper Derwent Valley circular route (15 miles) around Derwent, Ladybower and Howden reservoirs was a longer challenge, with beautiful views throughout. Slippery Stones, just beyond the northern end of Howden reservoir, proved the perfect lunch stop halfway round. We finished our trip on the High Peak and Tissington trails, which offered easy cycling with far-reaching rural views. Afternoon tea at Hartington farm shop and cafe ended a fantastic break.

        "body": "I don\u2019t know about you but I am so bored of all my clothes right now. My favourite jumpers have tipped from comforting familiarity into the kind of familiarity that breeds contempt. My winter coat hulks awkwardly on its peg in my hallway \u2013 like a party guest who doesn\u2019t know when to leave, getting on my nerves every time I walk past it. This happens every year at the tail end of winter. Every year, at the point when spring is in the air but in a flighty, unreliable way (it\u2019s still cold in the mornings, still dark in the evenings) I run clean out of enthusiasm for everything I\u2019ve been wearing. Which is rubbish, because feeling good about my outfit is the best trick I know for feeling good about a new day. But much as I would like to shove the coat in the attic and start wearing gingham sundresses and espadrilles, it\u2019s not a practical solution: I would probably give myself pneumonia and ruin said espadrilles in a muddy puddle. So this year I\u2019ve got a plan. Eight new styling tricks to spice up what\u2019s already in our wardrobes. No shopping, just styling. Wearing the same clothes, but in different ways. This is a terrible time of year to go shopping. There is no point buying more winter clothes, because you won\u2019t get enough wear out of them before summer happens, and when autumn rolls around they will feel like old clothes, so that\u2019s a waste of time and money. And it\u2019s too early to go in on proper summer clothes, which aren\u2019t going to be of much use in the weeks of unreliable weather we\u2019ve still got to get through. Styling tricks can transform your wardrobe. Nothing makes you look more instantly up-to-date than wearing your clothes the way the in-crowd do. One season it was shoulder-robing our coats, another it was French-tucking our shirts. Styling lets you play with your wardrobe, have fun with it, and that helps put the spark back into getting dressed. Styling tweaks can bring old favourites back into your look (hello, leopard, my old friend) and shuffle the deck so that the spotlight falls somewhere different. (See: the Power Sock, below.) I have spent much of the past few weeks watching fashion shows \u2013 which offer brilliant people watching in general, but are specifically excellent for getting a jump on the latest tips and tricks about how to wear clothes \u2013 and have distilled some key lessons into these ways to breathe new life into your between-seasons wardrobe. Are you ready, team? Let\u2019s go. Make a shirt sandwich Let me introduce you to the recipe you need in your life right now: the shirt sandwich. Which is exactly as it sounds. That is, the shirt is the filler in between two layers. Start with a fine, close fitting, high-necked layer \u2013 a plain polo neck is perfect. Then add a shirt, so that only the neckline of the bottom layer is visible. Then add a third layer: this can be a jacket, like I\u2019m wearing here, for when you want to look smart. This is a useful work formula, because it\u2019s cosier than just a shirt and a blazer and has a vaguely leftfield vibe that makes it interesting while remaining meeting-appropriate. The shirt sandwich also works well with a plain crew-neck sweater as the top layer. One combination I\u2019ve been wearing a lot is a sleeveless top with a lace trim collar by Me+Em, which I\u2019ve been wearing under a denim shirt under a loose-fit navy sweater \u2013 and while I know I said no shopping, I\u2019m making an exception to share this with you as it is unbelievably useful. Three contrasting colours or patterns makes a strong and vibrant look; two of the layers in a matching colour is more understated. Fashion writer Leandra Medine Cohen, who coined the \u201cshirt sandwich\u201d phrase for a look she first spotted in a Victoria Beckham lookbook, suggests wearing a hoodie as the top layer for a more casual look, or swapping the polo neck for a silk scarf tucked into the neck of your shirt when the weather warms up. Practical, tasty and satisfying. A recipe for a great sandwich. The two-texture trick Don\u2019t know whether to dress for winter or summer? Hedge your bets with a half-and-half outfit. A cosy, fluffy knit makes a silky skirt wearable on a chilly day, so long as the hemline is long enough to cover most of your legs. Or, flip it around, and team the kind of blouse you might wear on holiday \u2013 in cheesecloth, maybe, or broderie anglaise \u2013 with chunky cord trousers and a boot. It\u2019s a perfect balance of practicality and optimism, you see. Keep the colours tonal to tie the two contrasting pieces together, and add a little something shiny to highlight the textures. Leopard bites back Not that we needed an excuse to bring leopard print back, but the mob wife trend has given us one anyway. To recap, mob wife means lots of jewellery, attitude and flash. Noisy luxury rather than the quiet type. The vibe is: headed out for dinner with the girls, with money in your pocket, a boxfresh French manicure, and possibly a dead body in the boot of the car. Look, it\u2019s complicated, we\u2019ll come back to it, but for now all you need to know is that a hit of leopard where you wouldn\u2019t expect it can inject sass into any situation. Think leopard blouse under a smart jacket, or a glam leopard coat with relaxed, wide-leg jeans. Welcome to your Power Sock era Socks now have main character energy in fashion. This is quite a turn-up for the books because socks had been invisible for as long as I can remember. A bare ankle was the chic choice, and if a sock was essential, one chose a colour to blend with one\u2019s trousers and shoes, to make the socks as discreet as possible. But this season, my view across the catwalk to the legs swinging from chairs on the other side was dotted with cheerful socks. In bright colours and rich textures, power socks instantly lift your outfit from blah to snazzy, in the same way a great piece of jewellery can do. The power sock started out in athleisure. Look around any gym and you will notice that anyone under 30 wears chunky sport socks, out and proud over their leggings, rather than the low-cut liner socks I\u2019ve always worn with leggings and trainers. Well, now it has been promoted from the changing room to smart daywear. It\u2019s a bit preppy, so while it works with any shoe, it is particularly good with a loafer. Point of order: when I say power sock I do not, repeat not, mean novelty socks. The fluffy cartoon character pair you got as a Secret Santa gift is not the look we are after here. You want a good-quality sock in a strong colour. Can\u2019t go wrong with a pop of red. Drapescaping is the new tablescaping Just as tablescaping is a fancy word for setting the table, drapescaping is a fancy one for wearing a scarf. In the depths of winter, a scarf is to be wrapped as tightly around your neck and chin as possible, to ward off cold winds and lurgies. But now that we\u2019re not at risk of freezing, it is time to get creative. The Doctor Who fling has been happening at fashion week: throw one half over your shoulder, let the other hang free. Add a brooch at the shoulder for extra jazziness, and consider yourself drapescaped. Shoulder-robe your sweater I never got on with shoulder-robing my coat \u2013 it kept falling off, for a start, but it also wasn\u2019t keeping me warm, and I couldn\u2019t figure out what to do with my bag strap \u2013 but I am very excited about shoulder-robing 2.0, which you do with a sweater. It works like this. Get dressed, then pick out a jumper or cardigan that will work on top if you get cold later, but instead of putting it on, put your coat on first and then tie the knit around your shoulders, like a scarf. This is a good styling hack for days when you are going to be outside a lot and your coat will be the headline act of your outfit \u2013 because most coats are pretty dull-looking and a contrast knit adds personality. Footnote: remember that around your shoulders, not around your waist, is the only place to tie one\u2019s spare jumper these days. Try a redfit (or a bluefit) Layers are helpful in the shoulder season, when you need a combination that can cope with weather that shifts from one season to another and back again in the space of a day. When an outfit has lots of moving parts I tend to retreat into neutrals to keep the look from getting frantic, but here\u2019s an alternative: pick one colour, and wear it top to toe. Red is fun, grey looks chic, and electric blue is gathering steam as the next colour-of-the-moment. This has the added advantage of pretty much picking your outfit for you \u2013 if you make yourself stick to one colour, your wardrobe edits itself. Add a belt That\u2019s it. It\u2019s that simple. Think of a belt as jewellery for your trousers, adding emphasis and a bit of shine. A belt makes you look sharper, because it shows that you get that a good pair of trousers are the mainstay of a 2024 wardrobe. Side note: a belt like this is also good cinching a blazer, with jeans and a simple white T-shirt. Give it a try, I think you might like it. Photographer\u2019s assistant: Isaac Dann.

        "body": "Thirty-nine years since he helped to found Comic Relief in response to famine in Ethiopia, and 36 years since he began hosting the charity\u2019s telethons on BBC One, Lenny Henry is hanging up his red suit and packing away his red nose. This year\u2019s Comic Relief: Funny for Money will be the last Red Nose Day marathon with Henry as host. He says his farewell gig as the host of the 2024 show will be \u201cprobably the best night of my life\u201d \u2013 although he will remain as the life president of Comic Relief and will continue to work with the charity behind the scenes. He won\u2019t easily be replaced: few comics have embraced the daunting unpredictability of live TV, while bridging the gap between funny and deadly serious, with the skill and charm of the 65-year-old comic. Here are his best bits from nearly four decades of freestyle fundraising. Lenny woos Frank Bruno (1986) Proof of just how long Henry has been synonymous with Comic Relief \u2013 he has been at it since the era when his impersonation of lovable British boxing hero Frank Bruno was a big part of his TV act. At the Shaftesbury theatre in London, during a performance that predated the first televised Comic Relief fundraiser two years later, Henry, as Bruno, performs the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, with the real Bruno tottering out to play Juliet. Both of them milk every drop of pantomime silliness out of the skit. Lenny does Luther (2016) John Luther (Idris Elba) leaves a crime scene to fulfil a family obligation, picking up a supermarket chicken on his way to his mum\u2019s house, only for his myriad siblings \u2013 played by Henry and British sports stars, this being a skit for Comic Relief\u2019s now defunct spin-off, Sport Relief \u2013 to accuse him of murder. The athletes acquit themselves very well \u2013 Ian Wright and particularly Denise Lewis should consider doing more acting \u2013 but the big payoff is the sight of Henry in an exact replica of Elba\u2019s costume, catchphrases and gestures. Lenny snogs Elle Macpherson (1999) \u201cShe did tongues! She did tongues!\u201d The sequel to perhaps the best-known Red Nose Day moment of all \u2013 Dawn French snogging Hugh Grant, in 1995 \u2013 features Henry being pounced on by supermodel Elle Macpherson, to the theatrical chagrin of French, Henry\u2019s then wife. The feeling that nobody knows exactly what is going to happen here is Comic Relief\u2019s live telethons at their mildly chaotic best. Talking of which, kudos to Cilla Black, the third person on the presenting sofa, who displays faultless comic timing by suddenly mounting Henry to close the segment out. Lenny goes groin-to-groin with Tom Jones (1991) Theophilus P Wildebeeste \u2013 the inadequate-Lothario soul singer played by Henry back when The Lenny Henry Show was one of the nation\u2019s favourite sketch shows \u2013 dons leather, sequins and a large glowing red nose over his crotch, next to an identically attired Tom Jones, who was at the peak of his \u201cankle-deep in audience members\u2019 knickers\u201d phase at the time. Jones commits fully to the bit and is just too sexy for Theophilus, who tries to match Jones grunt for grunt and ends up slipping a disc. Almost as funny as Theophilus panicking at the end are Henry\u2019s character-breaking glances at someone off-camera throughout. Lenny live from Uganda (2015) Recently, Comic Relief has scaled back on what some viewers scornfully described as its \u201csaviour\u201d films, where a wealthy celebrity descends on an African village, cries at the poverty they see, and then waves a magic wand to improve a few lives. But nobody was better at selling the idea of the public\u2019s donations making a real difference than Henry \u2013 as seen when he goes live on BBC Breakfast to tour a sparkling new medical facility, built with Comic Relief money, in Iyolwa, Uganda. It\u2019s impossible not to be moved by Henry\u2019s visible joy and pride at what his organisation has achieved, in contrast to the desperate circumstances the local people were previously enduring. Lenny regenerates into David Tennant (2023) Next year\u2019s Comic Relief show will be the first one without Henry since 2009, when he was busy appearing on stage in Othello at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. His replacement, hosting the opening 100 minutes alongside Davina McCall, was David Tennant, and the former Doctor Who star has regularly helped Comic Relief out since then. Tennant is among those tipped to fill the Henry-shaped hole permanently. That might seem like an odd move, but the actor is branching out, having just been announced as the host of ITV\u2019s Traitors-esque reality gameshow Genius Game. This Comic Relief clip from last year, with Henry morphing into Tennant, Doctor Who-style, is a big hint.",

        "body": "Writer Nicole Flattery was born in Kinnegad, County Westmeath, in 1989. She studied theatre and film at Trinity College Dublin, followed by a master\u2019s in creative writing, and won the White Review short story prize in 2017. Her award-winning short story collection Show Them a Good Time was published in 2019, and her writing has appeared in publications including the Stinging Fly, the Guardian and London Review of Books. Her debut novel, Nothing Special, explores female friendship, fame and identity in 1960s New York; it is published in paperback by Bloomsbury on 28 March. 1. Place Lough Owel, County Westmeath This isn\u2019t far from my parent\u2019s house, and I go swimming here often with my mother and sister. It\u2019s very beautiful and there is a great sense of community between the swimmers. I like swimming most in the winter, when it\u2019s cold and it feels like an endurance test. For a brief few seconds, when you first jump in, you don\u2019t think at all. I wish I could do this every day. I didn\u2019t love growing up in rural Ireland when I was a teenager \u2013 I thought I was missing out on excitement and glamour, which I definitely was \u2013 but now I miss it a lot. 2. Film One from the Heart (dir Francis Ford Coppola) I just saw this rerelease: it was goofy, silly and fun but also, probably because it\u2019s Coppola, wildly detailed and sumptuous to watch. It\u2019s about a couple, Frannie (Teri Garr) and Hank (Frederic Forrest), in crisis in Las Vegas. She wants to travel; he wants to settle down. They break up and rebound with other people. Tom Waits does the soundtrack, and everything is highly stylised and surreal. I watch a lot of old films because I think you can learn from them, but also, more superficially, for the clothes. There\u2019s a red dress that Garr wears that I can\u2019t stop thinking about. I\u2019d happily take the broken heart if I could have that dress. 3. Television Love Is Blind (Netflix) This is a reality show with the basic premise you meet, fall in love and propose to someone sight unseen. All you have is a couple of conversations through a wall where you talk about spirituality, trauma and what you like to do on the weekends. Then you marry them! There have been six seasons of this now, and it\u2019s safe to conclude love isn\u2019t blind. It\u2019s fascinating to watch the couples emerge and try to reconcile their ideas of romantic love to the reality. Some of them are extremely single-minded, too: even if it\u2019s clear they can\u2019t stand the sight of their partner and want nothing to do with them, they marry them anyway. They\u2019re always saying things like: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to go to bed with you and wake up with you in the morning,\u201d like they\u2019re worried their partner is going to leave in the dead of night, which is exactly what I\u2019d do in that situation. I hope they make 100 seasons. 4. Critic AS Hamrah I feel, with the loss of Pitchfork and other publications, long-form criticism is dying slightly, which is a dreadful, terrifying shame. Personally, I love to read it. It makes sense of the world for me. AS Hamrah\u2019s great, playful film criticism book The Earth Dies Streaming is full of insight, wit and voice. You need critics like this, who understand that what we\u2019re watching often amounts to who we are. It also helps if you\u2019re very funny, which he is. His Oscars roundup, which is often only tangentially about the films themselves, is always the best piece of writing about awards season. 5. Tech Dumb phones I don\u2019t see how you could spend even an hour in Dublin and not see the ruinous impact of the tech industry. We sold the city to these companies and made it impossible for anyone else to live here. I don\u2019t just mean homelessness and outrageous rents, I also mean the lack of imagination and the fact that I sometimes have to drink in prohibitively expensive places called Ye Olde Irish Hardware Shoppe. I\u2019ve a dumb phone a lot of the time now. It\u2019s more social and I like talking to strangers. Leaving the house with a dumb phone is amazing. It\u2019s what I imagine being on the run feels like. 6. Coffee shop Lilliput Stores, Stoneybatter, Dublin I\u2019ve been going here for years because I used to work in Lilliput Press, the publishing house nearby, and now it\u2019s only a 10-minute walk from my home. It\u2019s very cosy and they\u2019ve a great selection of food, pastries and wine. They sell excellent honey, too, which I\u2019m addicted to. It\u2019s always my reward after I go to yoga. I actually spend most of the class thinking about what I\u2019m going to get, which probably isn\u2019t helping me achieve enlightenment. Everyone who works there is very friendly and warm, and it\u2019s really worth venturing outside the city for.",

        "body": "Born in London in 1968 to Nigerian parents, Maggie Aderin-Pocock is a scientist and presenter of The Sky at Night. She trained as a physicist \u2013 graduating from Imperial College London with a PhD in 1994, and working for the Ministry of Defence on landmine detection and missile warning systems. She has since designed a host of space instruments, become the first Black woman to win a gold medal in the Physics News Award and in 2013 took over from Patrick Moore as a co-host of the BBC\u2019s long-running astronomy show. Aderin-Pocock is one of the panellists for the National Trust\u2019s Time + Space Award, a new initiative to give 16- to 25-year-olds the resources to explore ideas. This was my Nigerian passport photo. I was quite excited to have my picture taken and my sister was, too. We were wearing Ladybird dresses from Woolworths. Mine was green with a collar and hers was red. I remember I was quite envious of hers. At a first glance my expression is quite innocent, but when I look closer it\u2019s not quite as sweet. There\u2019s a determination in those eyes that surprises me. I didn\u2019t think I had much of that at this age, but I must have done. Getting a Nigerian passport made me feel I had more of an identity, because, generally speaking, I didn\u2019t feel as if I belonged anywhere. I didn\u2019t speak any Nigerian language and I had never been there, but at the same time I didn\u2019t fit in in the UK. I was Black and living in Camden so, at school, students would say things like, \u201cGo home.\u201d Thankfully, my passion for space came along. I was born a year before the moon landings. Throughout my childhood, space was infused everywhere. I realised that when you look at Earth from space, you don\u2019t see barriers or division \u2013 you just see the planet. That was really appealing to me as a child. As were the Clangers, of course, and Star Trek. Star Trek was about people from all over the world, including aliens, like Spock, going on adventures and working together in harmony. The United Federation of Planets sounded fantastic and inspired me. When you are spacefaring none of the things that divide us matter: we are all just humanity. I\u2019d describe my childhood as turbulent, and that\u2019s with rose-tinted glasses! I went to 13 different schools. My parents split up when I was little, so sometimes I was with my mum and sometimes I was with my dad. The transfers from school to school weren\u2019t always smooth, but that level of change made me adaptable; a great life skill. As an adult, I\u2019m comfortable walking into any space and thinking, \u201cOK, how am I going to blend in here?\u201d After that picture was taken, my younger sister was sent to live in Nigeria. My father had four daughters and was working at the same time, so he was juggling too many balls and needed help from his family. That was a real wrench for me. I always looked after my sister as if I were her mini-mum. I was so sad when she left. I think there was a plan at one point to take me there, too, which is why we got those Nigerian passports. In the end, I was sent to boarding school. It was hard being away from home, but I loved learning and going somewhere new. My first boarding school was in the New Forest, Hampshire, which was quite the culture shock from London. Generally, people at the schools thought of me as nice but dim; partly because I was dyslexic, but, of course, nobody was diagnosing that back then. That level of underestimation didn\u2019t bother me \u2013 it just gave me the opportunity to prove them wrong. So I worked hard. Right from the get-go my father prioritised education. He\u2019d always ask me: \u201cSo what Oxford college are you going to go to?\u201d He had moved to the UK in the 1950s when the message was: no Blacks, no dogs, no Irish. He was bringing up daughters in a fairly hostile environment and believed the great leveller was education. When I was working for the Ministry of Defence, I used to have to write reports. I\u2019d procrastinate a lot. Everything would be last minute. I\u2019d think: why is everyone else able to write reports so easily, and come up with sentences that are succinct? Why is it so hard for me? I would beat myself up and thought I must be lazy, but actually I was just dyslexic, and I probably have ADHD, too. Those setbacks didn\u2019t deter me from my ambition, however. All my studies were a means to an end and every step, no matter how hard, got me closer to my crazy goal of getting into space so I could learn what\u2019s out there. I might not have had role models in the science world who looked like me, but I had strong, larger-than-life people like my sisters and my mum, who always lifted me up and drove me forward. During my PhD, I was in a cohort of 200 people at Imperial doing physics. There were five women, and one other Black person. I became used to entering a room and thinking: \u201cOh, I\u2019m the only Black person or woman here.\u201d When you have a common cause \u2013 space \u2013 that sense of difference often goes away. As my career progressed and I became a project manager, I was able to demonstrate that I am capable. I am not an alien. Assimilating in this industry hasn\u2019t always been easy. There have been times where I have walked into a room and someone has given me a set of keys and said: \u201cHere you go, you can clean the offices.\u201d Because I am a Black woman, they assume I must be a cleaner. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that profession, but the assumption that I wasn\u2019t there because I was a scientist was painful. I now consider it my role to try to help people overcome their assumptions, so they don\u2019t make those mistakes again, but it is sometimes hard and trying to take that on. The only time I\u2019ve properly wavered about my desire to get into space was when my daughter was born. I was 42 and I had worried I was never going to be able to have children. When she arrived, I was amazed. I thought: \u201cI\u2019ve got to stay here and look after this new vulnerable being!\u201d I realised that I had a job here on Earth. For a while she harboured the same dream as me: she told people that she wanted to be a scientist and travel to space with her mother. She\u2019s since moved on from that dream, but I haven\u2019t. If anything, I have become even more adventurous as I\u2019ve got older. I\u2019m still an absolute lunatic when it comes to space. If I have had a hard day, I look at the moon and it makes me feel better. I get quite frustrated when it\u2019s cloudy, because I can\u2019t see the moon properly. Space really puts things into perspective. It\u2019s vast and wide and glorious. It\u2019s not as if you just look up and all your problems go away, but it\u2019s important to realise that we are all part of something amazing. I remember being underestimated as a child. I wish I could go back to that little Maggie and say: \u201cYou can do it. You have the biggest dream and you have the potential.\u201d That\u2019s what I tell kids today whenever I meet them. Reach for the stars, have a crazy dream and let\u2019s see where it takes you.",

        "body": "The idea that Britain is becoming a more meritocratic society has long been a theme of Conservative leaders, from Theresa May to Liz Truss. That claim is challenged by the growing significance of the bank of mum and dad (bomad), and the embarrassment and guilt felt by some of those who have been forced to rely on parental largesse to buy their own home. \u201cI found it infantilising borrowing money from my dad,\u201d said Nic Jones, a senior university administrator who moved into her first home, a house in Brighton, with her partner last December at the age of 43. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him for it \u2013 we had a conversation and he asked how far away we were from what we needed. He just said: \u2018Well, I can lend it to you.\u2019 \u201cAt first I was really resistant. But you can only get a mortgage until you\u2019re 70, so we were running out of time. I find it really strange that I earn really well, my partner earns really well, but we\u2019re in this weird situation of having to rely on my parents.\u201d Jones sees colleagues in their 50s and 60s wanting to give their children a deposit, even delaying retirement. \u201cIf my dad had ever suggested that, I would definitely have said no. But I guess I can understand the parental impulse. \u201cThere is a sense of resentment, but not towards the people who can afford it \u2013 I resent the way the housing market is. And Liz Truss for hiking up the interest rates.\u201d Among the first-time buyers canvassed by the Observer, there is a notable lack of resentment towards those who are better off but instead a concern about what the situation means for people unable to get on to the property ladder. Michael Robinson, a 33-year-old software developer, is in the process of buying his first home, in Milton Keynes. He had no direct help but moved back in with his parents two years ago, and not paying rent has allowed him to raise \u00a330,000 for a deposit. \u201cMy parents did offer to help me out if I needed it,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t begrudge people doing that \u2013 for a lot of people it\u2019s necessary because of the gap in generational wealth. There\u2019s a much wider inequality in general than when my parents were doing this. \u201cEven for me, as a relatively wealthy person, I\u2019m in danger of being priced out, and that\u2019s pretty scary. It seems we\u2019re heading into a class system of people who own property and people who don\u2019t.\u201d There is no shortage of evidence of the impact of parental wealth on life chances. Successful professionals born between 1965 and 1981 live in less affluent areas if their parents were working class, researchers demonstrated, probably because they did not have access to a bank of mum and dad. Social mobility is now harder to achieve than it has been for 50 years because of the importance of inherited wealth. Alan, a 50-year-old doctor on a substantial salary, lived for a decade in a two-bedroom flat with his wife and three children in an expensive part of London close to the hospital where he works. Now they are in a three-bedroom ex-council flat, battling problems with damp, thanks to a \u00a3100,000 gift from his father. \u201cHow can it be that at the age of 50, with 25 years of experience, I\u2019m having to rely on my father to help me buy a small flat?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed in lots of ways \u2013 embarrassed that I\u2019m having to rely on my parents, embarrassed that I have access to this resource, and angry that even with all that resource you end up living in something that\u2019s only just adequate.\u201d For Laura Nelson, a 36-year-old content designer, being able to buy her home thanks to a \u00a35,000 gift from her grandparents meant freedom from having to move again. \u201cIn the 15 years I\u2019ve lived in Brighton, I\u2019ve had 10 or 11 addresses. Having to move every single year is really annoying. And I had an illegal cat, so to be able to live without the fear of my landlord discovering was a big thing.\u201d Many beneficiaries face another dilemma: talking about it or not. Revealing they had help might invite envy, yet not doing so might make friends wanting to buy a house believe they were doing something wrong, Jones said. And there are family secrets \u2013 one new homeowner who had help from relatives is not allowed to talk to her cousins about their support, since the others will not get help on the basis that their parents are rich enough already. Dr Liz Moor, an academic at Goldsmiths, University of London, conducted research on how people reconciled receiving parental gifts with the idea of living in a meritocratic society, something most supported. People were understandably defensive. \u201cThey tended to try and recast the gift as evidence of meritocratic progress for the family as a whole,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they tried to tell a story where their parents or grandparents had come from much more humble, working-class roots than they themselves did; that they\u2019d had to work hard, save hard, be careful with money in order to get enough money to buy property of their own. \u201cMy co-author and I know that story \u2013 it\u2019s one we told ourselves. But that story got a bit tricky when we started to ask about friends, because it becomes clear it\u2019s not about how hard you\u2019re working \u2013 it\u2019s about unfairness and arbitrariness as to who gets housing security and who doesn\u2019t. And then people come back to rely on ideas about family and the naturalness of wanting to pass things on to one\u2019s children, one\u2019s descendants.\u201d",

        "body": "Staff at Tees Valley Education (TVE), which runs four primaries and a special school in some of the region\u2019s most deprived areas, are used to looking for signs that families are under serious strain. One mother\u2019s hands were \u201craw and red\u201d, recalls Katrina Morley, its chief executive. \u201cShe and her husband had five jobs between them,\u201d Morley explains. \u201cShe was hand-washing the children\u2019s uniforms regularly and they were turning up to school immaculate, but the detergent was eating away at her hands.\u201d Morley says \u201cwhite goods poverty\u201d \u2013 particularly families without working washing machines or cookers \u2013 is now an area of desperate unseen need. She says the trust tries to negotiate with council teams or connect families with charities who can help. They have pastoral teams who build relationships with families, while staff are always on hand to talk at the school gates, and often the school will be the only trusted or available place for parents to turn for help. Morley adds that all their schools have washing machines and those that have showers are also used for pupils struggling to wash at home. This trust educates some of the poorest communities in the country. On average, schools in England have nearly 24% of pupils on free school meals, but in these schools between 69% and 97% of pupils are eligible. Sean Harris, who leads on improvement, research and innovation at TVE, and is an expert on poverty in schools, says it\u2019s not as simple as saying quality teaching will fix everything: \u201cIf a child is hungry and not cared for it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a bloody good teacher.\u201d He believes that in order to deliver \u201cdeep social justice\u201d, schools have to do \u201cdeep social listening\u201d to understand what their children are living through, without making assumptions. \u201cThat\u2019s hard in education when you\u2019re really busy,\u201d he admits. Both he and Morley grew up in poverty, but the trust educates its teachers about what children are experiencing. Alongside lack of food, lack of sleep has become a big issue. Morley says some children don\u2019t have a bed, while others share a bed with siblings. Some can\u2019t sleep because they don\u2019t have enough bedding in an unheated property and they\u2019re cold. Others can\u2019t sleep because they are anxious. The trust knows sleep deprivation, like hunger, is likely to impact a child\u2019s ability to focus and retain information, and they work with regional charities to pull in help. This winter, as fuel prices soared, pastoral teams discreetly donated blankets. Many kids are shouldering a lot. \u201cSometimes parents are trying to hold down three or four or five different jobs and the child might be taking younger siblings to school or putting food on the table,\u201d Morley says. The trust\u2019s magazine for parents focuses on low-income activities and cooking on a budget. They have drop-in coffee mornings and give parents free breakfasts, as a chance to open up dialogue about where they need help. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving them some dignity,\u201d Morley says. She adds: \u201cThese children deserve every chance every day.\u201d",

        "body": "No novelist, whatever the main subject of their work, should ignore climate change, argues Paul Murray, the author who has just received one of Britain and Ireland\u2019s top literary prizes for The Bee Sting. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say climate worry was the motivation for my book, but I really do feel like it is the unavoidable background for being alive in the 21st century. I don\u2019t want to get on a soap box, yet we ought to surely be thinking about it, at some level, most of the time now,\u201d said Nero Gold prize winner Murray, whose tragicomic saga was also shortlisted for last year\u2019s Booker prize. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned that there are some new books that don\u2019t address it at all. What does it mean to ignore it? After all, I\u2019m a Catholic, but I don\u2019t think even that religion could invent something inspiring so much guilt. I mean, every time you turn on a light!\u201d Murray was talking to the Observer in his first interview since winning the \u00a330,000 prize for Book of the Year at the inaugural awards. The annual competition has filled the gap left by the prestigious former Costa prize, an award that ran for 50 years and was initially known as The Whitbread. Murray\u2019s novel, which topped the fiction category a month ago, was then pitted against the other category winners, including Scottish writer Fern Brady\u2019s non-fiction memoir, Strong Female Character. Also in contention for the overall winner\u2019s prize at last Thursday night\u2019s London ceremony were the debut novel, Close to Home, by Michael Magee, and the children\u2019s story, The Swifts, by Beth Lincoln. The judges, led by Booker winner Bernardine Evaristo, included writers Sara Collins, Sarfraz Manzoor, Anthony Quinn and Dave Rudden. Concern about climate change is woven through The Bee Sting, which follows two generations of an Irish family as they struggle to stay on track while keeping dangerous personal secrets. It has proved both a popular and critical hit since its publication by Hamish Hamilton last June and this weekend Murray revealed that negotiations to bring his rollercoaster story to the screen are well under way. \u201cA plan to serialise it as a drama for television is in the works,\u201d he said. The character of Willie, a minor hero of the novel who stays chiefly off stage, is given one stirring political speech about climate change that Murray admits does \u201cslightly break the fourth wall\u201d and which expresses many of his own views. \u201cWillie is being a politician at that point, and is wooing a crowd, but I agree with much of it,\u201d he said. Murray, 49, was born in Dublin and in his early 20s took up a place on the renowned creative writing course at the University of East Anglia. Recent funding threats to the course, which in the past has produced writers such as Kazuo Ishiguro, Tracy Chevalier and Ian McEwan, have shocked him, he said. \u201cI\u2019d be very sorry to ever see it go. I can\u2019t understand why this government would want to allow this assault on the university system. I wrote my first novel there and it literally changed my life. I was taught by Ali Smith, who is a genius, but also very generous, as she told her editor about my book.\u201d Murray believes the looming threat to writers posed by the speedy progress of artificial intelligence should also not be underestimated: \u201cIt seems the whole of human communication is being assailed now, perhaps because the leaders of the tech industry have no conception of what it is to be human, or what sincerity is. They can\u2019t own it, so they want to get rid of it.\u201d Literary fiction, Murray consoles himself, might still be safer than other forms of writing: \u201cIt will soon be possible to fake up novels better and better, but what for? When you read you connect with an author, with their intimate experience of life, and that is something you can\u2019t get in any other way.\u201d Working on The Bee Sting was enjoyable, Murray said, although he admits that its tense denouement \u2013 one that has troubled many readers \u2013 was \u201cvery hard\u201d to write. \u201cI tried out all sorts of epilogues, where things would be clarified. In my mind it was all very clear. But they didn\u2019t work. And so if it is ambiguous, well, then everyone\u2019s reading is as valid as anyone else\u2019s.\u201d",

        "body": "A young male writer turned 60 recently and complained about getting old. Please, I thought, I\u2019ve unwound nine-tenths of my mortal coil, don\u2019t tell me about getting old, young whippersnapper. One glaring difference in the two decades that stand between us is underlined by the fact a 60-year-old male probably hasn\u2019t experienced ageism yet. A fit man at that age is not far off his social and cultural peak; dress him in a suit and he could be a minister of the crown or a hot-shot CEO. A woman \u2013 and in most cases, a man nearing his 80s \u2013 is more than likely just the furniture of the street; only her peer group really sees her as an equal. Although we might rail against being the wallpaper of the modern age and whinge about being patronised, younger members of society should still feel free to give up that bus seat or let us jump the queue. Chances are our legs aren\u2019t too strong any more. These things are as nothing compared with the horror Proust evokes when describing the impact the \u201cchemistry of time\u201d has had on his own idiosyncratic and once-vital characters. His descriptions of decrepitude send one rushing to the mirror. It becomes best not to dwell on the way body fat coalesces into a soccer-ball stomach almost overnight; nor to notice how cheeks have travelled down to swell a turkey neck; nor how cement, not fairy dust, seems to have been sprinkled on wrinkles. But etched in the aged faces and bodies of my friends are lifetimes of experience and wisdom, and when they smile and laugh, the cliche comes alive \u2013 I see the carefree young people they were. They grew in the lace-curtained middle of the last century, some with fathers who had been to war. All lived through what some think was the golden age of Australia and also through times of accelerating social change. I think especially of the women riding the wave of their ninth decade now \u2013 what a generation of women this was and is. We were formed by key social events of the times \u2013 the advent of TV, the swinging 60s, the pill, the Vietnam war, Vatican II, second-wave feminism \u2026 and that just takes us to the beginning of the 80s. I think of our parents\u2019 generation which faced greater challenges \u2013 world wars, the depression \u2013 and I think of the struggles of my ancestors, of the brave matriarchy that preceded me. Like many, what I do know is that the centrepiece of life is family, the one anchor that has kept me afloat in often challenging seas. To watch one\u2019s children grow and then their children \u2013 as one generation gives away to another \u2013 fulfils a deep primal need. Between the joy and the tears is the contentment of love. After a rollercoaster ride through life, now as I get older, it is the quiet in a noisy world that I find peaceful. A house that was once a chaotic pit stop for a hard-working single mother and kids is now an ordered haven of stillness. I rode the rollercoaster too often and now like the feeling of my feet on the ground. I no longer really love talking to strangers, for to talk to strange people may be to talk to dull people. Sure, behind everyone is a story but some of them I no longer have time to read. Many people live lives dominated by the metronome of habit. When Proust speaks of the \u201ctorpor of habit\u201d surely he is warning us that the constant daily wheel of repetition has rendered some constrained. A standout gift of ageing is time \u2013 time to be still, to notice the shapes and colours of the world, to remember, to understand our failures so that we might empathise with others. My memory bank is like Jack Horner\u2019s plum pudding, only a fabled magic one. I put in my thumb and pull out some long-forgotten joy or near miss and they keep on coming, too fast to catalogue. Being in the late evening of life we learn to reflect, to meditate on things lost and things gained, to contemplate a society alien to the one we knew as children. We still miss old dead mates, so many of them now that I keep a digital roll call of the dead who coloured my life. Some of those who are left have become impatient and cranky, best enjoyed in small doses. These are the ones who\u2019ve had enough, waiting to go, melancholy masked by mannerisms. Being on the cusp of one\u2019s ninth decade does not mean that engagement in the world is less. There is yin yoga, exercise, daily coffee with local friends. Importantly, keeping the grey matter active there is intellectual, cultural and political talk with engaged mates discussing the frailties of today\u2019s world and perhaps even gossiping about a former tall poppy or two. Currently there is the weekly flag-waving march through the city in opposition to this dreadful war on Gaza. A trip to ancient Greece and probably my farewell visit to Florence and Rome are in the planning. As I slide towards my ninth decade there are many things I regret. I regret that I did not stop and breathe more often; that I was not kinder more often; that I sometimes suffered fools for too long. I regret not knowing the constellations of the night sky, comparative mythology, how to speak Italian and Arabic fluently, how to ride a motorbike, play mahjong and dance tango. Then there are all the books I have not read \u2013 many of which sit beside my bed. Some days this list seems endless. The young 60-year-old writer has rich times ahead of him. Family, friends, knowledge, wisdom \u2013 the rich tapestry of life to enjoy. One day he will join those of us on the very slippery slope, rising unsteadily from the cafe chair, an hour of life measured out in Prufrock\u2019s coffee spoons, souls on the edge of transit, revelling in the kaleidoscope of memories and in plans for the next exciting feasible adventure. Until then he is welcome to smile at all the ninth- and even tenth-decade souls he passes.",

        "body": "In 1971, the Observer bade farewell not just to Edward Howes \u2013 the second-last \u2018genuinely grand\u2019 butler in England \u2013 but to a whole way of life. Howes entered service in 1928 aged 15 as a \u2018hall boy\u2019 in Eaton Square. It was another time in many ways: manservants had to be at least 6ft tall and were forbidden to wear glasses, shoes were polished with a bone, and clothes were folded, never hung. \u2018Coat hangers are recent,\u2019 he said. Explaining how he came to work for Sir Michael Duff, aged 21, Howes used the language of quasi-possession. \u2018I was Sir Michael\u2019s first servant of his own\u2026 Lady Juliet\u2026 decided I would do for her son.\u2019 The two seem to have rubbed along happily for the intervening decades. \u2018He\u2019s been a good friend,\u2019 Howes said of his employer. Sir Michael was \u2018very wealthy and very eligible and we went to stay at every great house in England\u2019. There were \u2018glittering parties\u2019 and high-profile encounters (the Prince of Wales \u2018always had too much cuff showing\u2019). Howes was promoted to butler at 27, married at 33 and settled in a \u2018solid house, of style and size\u2019 in the grounds of Duff\u2019s North Wales mansion, Vaynol, until the war. After war work in a factory, it was back to business as usual for Howes, albeit with a skeleton staff. If \u2018outside, the old social order was peeling\u2019, inside, the fun wasn\u2019t quite over. Howes abetted his employer by serving an entire meal backwards (\u2018liqueurs to start, soup to finish\u2019) to tease the local gentry and welcomed the royal family to Vaynol on a short-notice visit: \u2018the greatest thrill of his working life\u2019. Of course, Howes served at his own retirement party. Having replied to his employer\u2019s toast (\u2018his emotion was admirably regulated just enough to show\u2019), he gave \u2018Two signals: one to the footmen to resume table service, the other, invisible but equally obvious, to the guests to return to the natural order of things\u2019.",

Listen, read and taste. Keep all that going and And don\u2019t become old, fight ageing. I was brought up in a farmhouse in the Irish countryside where there were rabbits, pheasants, butter-making, it was all going on. There was always a wild salmon coming and going into our house. But nobody intellectualised food: it was just food for the table. The smell of bread is the overriding memory: that\u2019s why we make bread for all our restaurants. There\u2019s something about the smell of freshly baked bread in a kitchen: it\u2019s magic. I had a minimum amount of education, which is true for a lot of people in hospitality. Now, when people say: \u201cI left doing a master\u2019s in law and I became a chef,\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cJesus Christ! Will someone show them the way back to the master\u2019s in law?!\u201d When we opened at the National Portrait Gallery last year, I worked there for four and a half months, every bloody day. The director said it was a bit like Hotel California: \u201cCorrigan, you\u2019re in, you\u2019re never leaving!\u201d But I didn\u2019t want to be another name, turn up once a week and just walk away. No, I wanted to feel that there was real effort put into it. And real Real effort deserves man hours on the floor, on site. End of story. You can\u2019t do it on the phone, you\u2019re not going to do it on a video call, you\u2019re not going to do it from your bedroom. No place in London sells as many oysters as Bentley\u2019s. And for good reason. We look after our oysters with religious zeal. Because oysters can cause a lot of problems: there should be a warning sign at certain times of the year, especially when a lot of people won\u2019t keep them in the filtration baths for around 36 hours. And our oysters come straight to us from the coast. We don\u2019t deal with a middleman, so we know where things come from. I am not afraid to put offal on a menu, because if you are going to eat a chop, you must eat the offal. You must eat the tongues, the hearts, the livers, the trotters \u2026 eat the whole bloody animal. If not, be vegetarian. To me, St Patrick\u2019s Day is a get together day for humanity. Let\u2019s be clear: the Irish know how to celebrate. We spend it like sailors on leave, the English hoard it like misers. You know that and I know that: we don\u2019t want to insult each other. But I don\u2019t like it to be just this beer-swilling alcohol day. You\u2019re not going to see me wrapped in your shamrock and greens and singing fucking Molly Malone, that\u2019s not really me. I try to stay away from ultra fine dining restaurants. I like going to Paris, but when you get the bill, you want to cry. I took my chefs to L\u2019Ambroisie, a three-star place, a few years ago and honestly I think I shed a tear. My card refused to go through! You just think: \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d I really love what I do \u2013 and that\u2019s unusual at 60. I\u2019ve met lots of people in the City of London and all different types and they all hate what they do. They\u2019re burned out, they\u2019re all stressed. But I fell into hospitality and the love affair over all these years has never dwindled. If anything, I\u2019m even more mad passionate. OFM My favourite things Food Bentley\u2019s soda bread with Lincolnshire poacher butter. When you understand what great butter is and what great bread is, that starts your journey in the kitchen. Drink I love the flavour of fortified wine at the moment: sherries and ports and madeiras are on another bloody level. Sherry may be the most underrated drink in the world. Place to eat Phil Howard\u2019s Elystan Street is the place I\u2019ve been more often than anywhere else. I like Phil, I like the way he cooks. And Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho at Sabor: she\u2019s a powerhouse of individuality. You have a bit of suckling pig at Sabor: heaven! Dish to make Lamb\u2019s liver is just one of the great things to eat. And you don\u2019t need to be a chef. You just need great balsamic, great sea salt and a lovely bit of fresh lamb\u2019s liver and some bitter leaves, and you have the most delicious lunch.

On this loosely conceptual follow-up she unpicks that relationship\u2019s speedy demise, while also contending with new love and the tabloid fallout from it. Lead single Yes, And? neatly sums up Grande\u2019s attitude towards rumours and parasocial probing: \u201cYour business is yours and mine is mine/ Why do you care so much whose dick I ride?\u201d The line is delivered with such restraint that its impact goes unnoticed at first. It\u2019s a technique that Grande, who possesses a voice that could strip wallpaper, uses throughout, be it alluding to cheating on the fluttering title track, or asking for clemency on the excellent, Robyn-esque We Can\u2019t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love). The latter\u2019s juddering synths and perkier BPM are an outlier on an album that favours midtempo R&amp;B, offering up space for Grande to experiment with sumptuous vocal layering (The Boy Is Mine) and melodies as sharp as cut glass (Supernatural). Refined and subtle, but with the right amount of bite (see the darkly hued True Story), Eternal Sunshine feels like a clearing of the emotional decks.",

        "body": "Kacey Musgraves has turned over a new leaf. On the serene title track of her sixth album, Deeper Well, the Nashville-based country crossover star, known for singing about her love of smoking weed, admits that she has given it up. Within that admission, and the song\u2019s delicate, pared-back pop-country arrangement, is the promise of a more clarified, mature iteration of Musgraves, and sometimes that\u2019s what Deeper Well provides. On Lonely Millionaire, which samples a song by the rapper JID, she invokes the shallowness of fame and wealth with the earnest but acerbic sparkle that filled her previous album, jaded divorce record Star-Crossed. At other times it seems as if this gesture towards maturity has instead resulted in a tilt into the generic: Heart of the Woods is the kind of community-minded ballad that sizzled on earlier Musgraves albums but here feels sapped of specificity. Elsewhere, songs such as Jade Green are so focused on the minutiae of her life as to feel tedious. She finds a delicate balance between the two, though, on Anime Eyes, a dizzying, almost comically lovestruck track that finds Musgraves eschewing the tasteful zen of the rest of the album in favour of all-out lyrical maximalism.

He narrated more than 245 books, including The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, voted best audiobook of the year in 2009. Saul was born in Cape Town, South Africa, where he attended Wynberg boys\u2019 high school and afterwards did various jobs until his antipathy towards apartheid prompted him to move to the UK in the late 1960s. Graduating from the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1972, he soon found work in theatre and television. His TV career included appearances in Space: 1999, Crossroads and This Life, while on the stage he acted with the National Theatre in various roles. Later, he began writing for the stage, including the comedy Who\u2019s the Daddy? in 2005. His theatrical adaptations of the tales of the Yiddish author and playwright Sholem Aleichem became very popular, and his first adaptation, Roots \u2026 Shmoots!, toured globally, clocking up 35 cities along the way. Throughout his career he continued with his narrations and voiceovers, and when ill health interrupted his most recent run of one-man Sholem Aleichem performances, he fell back on his audiobook work, continuing determinedly. To the end, he could often be seen in the cafes of Hornsey and Crouch End in north London, where he lived \u2013 working on his next narration and whiling away happy hours in idle chitchat with friends who popped in. A self-sufficient, warm and supportive man for whom nothing was too much trouble, he leaves behind an impressively diverse body of work, and a lot of happy memories for those who were fortunate to know him.",

        "body": "The concept of \u201cgenius loci\u201d \u2013 the spirit of a place, often with a connotation of protection or nurturing \u2013 is the foundation of Esther Rutter\u2019s revivifying blend of memoir, literary history and travelogue. Eliding three books into one, she explores her own terrifying mental collapse and tentative recovery, the lives of Romantic poet William Wordsworth, his sister Dorothy and their confr\u00e8re Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the efforts to preserve the Wordsworths\u2019 cottage at Grasmere within the context of the Lake District as a whole. At times, the reader may feel a little too aware of the compression mechanism at work, but the book is nonetheless alive with fascinating episodes and potted histories and, even more importantly, a heartfelt commitment to the power of place and of poetry to sustain lives and minds. Grasmere was not Rutter\u2019s first attempt to transport herself to an entirely unfamiliar landscape and thereby to find a new direction for her life. As a 21-year-old, she set off to teach English in a small Japanese village, living alone in a rented apartment with very little Japanese at her disposal. This was not a grand gap year adventure born of a privileged upbringing \u2013 Rutter writes effectively about the challenges and ruptures in her familial environment \u2013 but an attempt to get close up to another culture and way of being. And it was working, until she suffered a sudden breakdown of her mental health, a sort of dissolution of the self: severe anxiety attacks, agitation and a deep-seated feeling in her body that \u201chappiness would for ever pass me by\u201d. Within a couple of weeks, she had been admitted to a psychiatric facility, where she was shown great kindness but remained unclear as to the path toward diagnosis and treatment; and then, an abrupt return home. In one sense, she was back where she started; in another, she was profoundly and permanently altered. Where does Wordsworth come in? After a period of recuperation \u2013 and with the jury still out on how lasting and durable the improvement would be \u2013 Rutter applied to become one of an annual group of interns who spend a year working at Dove Cottage, the small, white house in Cumbria in which William and Dorothy lived for many years. Determinedly ungrand, the cottage saw the composition of some of the former\u2019s greatest work, including early incarnations of his long, autobiographical poem The Prelude, which was not published until 1850, the year of his death. It is this astonishing work, a breathtakingly ambitious synthesis of introspection and outward-facing inquiry, that invokes the possibility of having the Earth \u201call before me\u201d and confronting it \u201cWith a heart / Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty\u201d. Rutter got the job, despite \u2013 and perhaps even because of \u2013 crying in the interview, and embarked on a year devoted to helping with Dove Cottage\u2019s upkeep, its guided tours and programme of poetry readings. It\u2019s hardly surprising when the highly particular nature of the work combines with the awe-inspiring beauty of the landscape to produce an intense feeling of connection; but Rutter senses something even more fundamental. What she is experiencing, she begins to realise, is a manifestation of \u201ckith\u201d \u2013 a feeling of being oneself in a place, at home in both body and mind. All Before Me also explores how William and Dorothy, who had been separated in childhood following the death of their mother, created their own home, after several false starts (there is a particularly compelling account of their season in Germany, when they were all but abandoned by Coleridge, who went off with some other pals and left brother and sister freezing and virtually penniless). It was in Grasmere that the Wordsworths began to link natural beauty with community and creativity, an identification with place that makes the tiny settlement of Townend feel to visitors not merely a stop on the literary tourist trail but the embodiment of a greater artistic impulse. William and Dorothy did not spend all of their lives in Grasmere, and nor does Rutter; but she shows how once somewhere has got inside you, it\u2019s quite possible to take it with you to pastures new. \u2022 All Before Me: A Search for Belonging in Wordsworth\u2019s Lake District by Esther Rutter is published by Granta (\u00a316.99).

It\u2019s addictive.\u201d It was a brave moment of exploration that followed the hardest period of Bishop\u2019s life. Three years earlier, his wife, Janet, had died of ovarian cancer. The pair met in 1959, at a mountaineering club in Hull, when he was just 17. \u201cI saw this beautiful girl and had no idea how to talk to her, but I eventually gathered the courage,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was the first girl I\u2019d ever kissed and we fell in love. A few years later, we were married.\u201d The couple had four children, nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. They enjoyed an active life, filling holidays with sailing, skiing and hiking. Then, in April 2020, Janet suddenly succumbed to the cancer she had been diagnosed with two years previously. \u201cIt got very serious in only a matter of weeks. Since it was the start of the Covid lockdowns, it was very isolating,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to have an unattended cremation and it was a grim time for everyone.\u201d Home alone, without the person he had always turned to for support, Bishop went for daily walks in the nearby Yorkshire Dales and tried to write about his experiences. \u201cIt distanced me from the pain,\u201d he says. \u201cIt put it elsewhere for a while, on to the page, since no one can live with that amount of anguish forever.\u201d He had given up skiing a decade earlier out of fear of taking a bad fall and doing irreparable damage to his body, but he found himself longing for the experience of being on the mountainside again. \u201cI wanted to find a way of getting back to the outdoors, to experience the wind and the majestic views,\u201d he says. \u201cI also needed it socially. When you have spent a lifetime talking to a lovely woman, the silence becomes very present.\u201d A mountaineering friend offered a solution. He suggested that Bishop try snowshoeing, a low-impact activity that would allow him to walk to high altitudes without the risks of skiing. He called up the leaders of a forthcoming week-long expedition being organised by the UK branch of the Austrian Alpine Club; they assured him that if he could walk, he could snowshoe. By March 2023, Bishop was in the Tirol mountains in the Alps with a dozen strangers from across Europe and a trained leader. \u201cIt was really strenuous activity, walking up to eight hours a day, but I had the most wonderful time,\u201d he says. \u201cPlus, I was with a fantastic selection of people from their 40s upwards, all open-minded, generous and keen to share this experience together.\u201d Learning mountain-rescue techniques and methods for spotting signs of avalanches while he walked, Bishop was enthused by the combination of physical and mental challenges. When he returned home, he booked another week-long expedition for the next winter. \u201cSince it\u2019s so active, the snowshoeing trips have encouraged me to get healthier and do 20 squats every morning, as well as regular tai chi and pilates,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I can maintain fitness in my older years and it\u2019s a tremendous ego boost \u2013 the leader of the December trip called me inspirational!\u201d His family are keen for him to keep going. \u201cThey joke that it\u2019s the way I\u2019d want to go anyway, so they\u2019re great supporters,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough none of them have been tempted to take a trip with me yet.\u201d Bishop has another expedition planned for this month. This time, he is training to become an assistant, leading beginners on walks. He hopes to undertake a more strenuous hike in Finland, with stops in alpine huts inside the Arctic Circle. \u201cI got hooked on this whole mountaineering thing when I was 17, so I\u2019ll keep going as long as my joints will allow me,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we get older, we might drift out of sight a bit, but it\u2019s our time to do whatever we please. It is what Janet would have wanted.\u201d \u2022 Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",

Shakspeare is not our poet, but the world\u2019s, Therefore on him no speech! and brief for thee, Browning! Since Chaucer was alive and hale, No man hath walkt along our roads with step So active, so inquiring eye, or tongue So varied in discourse. But warmer climes Give brighter plumage, stronger wing: the breeze Of Alpine highths thou playest with, borne on Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, where The Siren waits thee, singing song for song. One of the Victorian poets usually, and mistakenly, categorised as \u201cminor\u201d, Walter Savage Landor was a rare early supporter of the unquestionably major writer, Robert Browning. A comparison of birth dates shows the age difference between the poets to have been considerable: Landor (1775-1864), Browning (1812-1889). Landor\u2019s sonnet gains something in human stature from being an unstinted response by a senior poet to one much younger. The admiration, it should be said, was mutual. A long friendship evolved, and Landor, who spent a number of years in Italy, would receive support from the Browning family during his chaotic later life. First published in the Morning Chronicle in 1845, To Robert Browning is an unrhymed sonnet \u2013 very unusual for the mid-19th century. Solidly crafted in iambic pentameter, it plays syntax against line with the fluency of a classically trained poet and dramatist: I think few readers would be distracted by the want of a rhyme-scheme chiming through the soundscape. But it\u2019s not predictably smooth: Landor clearly and memorably states his regard for Browning\u2019s energy and variety (lines seven to 10) and takes on some of the formal challenge. The sonnet moves quickly and broadly in its thought, with a delayed \u201cturn\u201d in line 10 introducing what is almost a fresh start. Landor begins with a characteristic flourish of aphorism. The lively generalisation in the paired couplets unites the two poets across their contrasting situations. Browning had published Sordello (1840) and might have felt like the singer none could hear as he confronted its reception. And Landor himself is, of course, the \u201cpraiser\u201d looking up and seeing the younger poet \u201cfar above\u201d \u2013 and not feeling at all disgruntled. The emphasis is on the \u201cdelight\u201d of the unheard singer and the inferior admirer: no frustration or envy sours Landor\u2019s genial sight. This is not to suggest there\u2019s no element of playfulness, but it enters by the back doors of spelling, resulting in a faintly mock-archaic tone. On the spelling of Shakespeare, Landor\u2019s choice was not an unusual one at the time of writing but other choices seem rather deliberately mannered: \u201cwalkt\u201d for instance, and \u201chighths\u201d. This flicker of irony allows Landor to smile in an elder-brotherly way at a notion of poetry which Browning himself might have more scornfully smiled at. Landor sees it as a form of high style \u2013 a kind of antiquing that lifts the tribute he\u2019s composing, although he smiles. Dispatching Browning from the local English roads to \u201cwarmer climes\u201d, Landor sees a gain in \u201cbrighter plumage, stronger wing\u201d \u2013 a triumphant vision, since the wing is strong enough to bear the weight of the bright plumage. Browning had already visited Italy to research Sordello, and he would live there from the beginning of his marriage to Elizabeth Barrett in 1846. Landor seems to view the younger poet\u2019s travels in terms of further future possibility. Could he have known about the marriage plans already? If he had, his reference to the waiting Siren might possibly be a mischievous reference to Elizabeth Barrett Browning-to-be. If she is going to match Robert \u201csong for song\u201d might she be competition as well as inspiration? I think the vision, whether it indeed includes Browning\u2019s future wife or refers to a merely mythological Siren, is more generous than that. With just a ghost of a rhyme (\u201con\u201d / \u201csong\u201d) to underline the jest, the sonnet closes in a further vision of the \u201cdelight in singing\u201d, a delight that this time is to be shared.",

        "body": "Very quietly, without much publicity or promotion, Girls5Eva appeared on Netflix last week. For those of us who haven\u2019t kept their eye on the ball, this came as an immense surprise. Because as far as we were concerned, Girls5Eva was dead. At the end of its second season a year and a half ago, the show\u2019s original platform Peacock announced that it would not renew the show. And we made our peace with that. Written by Meredith Scardino, a storied writer with credits on SNL and The Colbert Report, Girls5Eva at times seemed almost too beautiful to live. A sitcom about four middle-aged women determined to reform their noughties girl group and recapture a flicker of their old fame, it was not only dense with every form of joke imaginable \u2013 never has a show revelled quite so much in the background sight gag \u2013 but at times weirdly touching. Produced by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock, it shared an innate DNA with 30 Rock and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It was fast and precise, and boasted a murderer\u2019s row of talent. Some of the cast you knew would be good. Busy Philipps is as reliable a comedy performer as you are ever likely to find, with a face elastic enough to convey a full spectrum of confusion and disgust, and Paula Pell has spent years looking for a breakout vehicle like this. But others were a total coin toss. The ostensible lead of the show was the earnest piano balladeer Sara Bareilles, a woman who did not seem like a natural fit for screwball comedy, and yet turned out to be brilliant. And then there was Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, best known for playing Angelica Schuyler in Hamilton, who was absolutely revelatory as the absurd narcissist Wickie Roy. It\u2019s absurd that you can be in Hamilton and then find a star-making role, but that\u2019s exactly what Goldsberry did with Girls5Eva. If you were reluctant to watch initially, it\u2019s worth it just to see the levels of mania she is able to hit. And now you have another chance. It\u2019s slightly surprising that Netflix picked up Girls5Eva. Long gone are the days when Netflix would swoop in and rescue any vaguely beloved show that looked like it might be in trouble. Now it has a habit of cutting shows off in their prime, unless millions of diehard fans are prepared to dedicate their entire lives to relentlessly pestering executives for a renewal. And Girls5Eva definitely did not have that. It had fans, yes, but it was a show for adults with busy lives that didn\u2019t leave any room for annoying letter-writing campaigns. But here we are. Girls5Eva is back, and more or less as good as it ever was. The comeback season is structured around the group\u2019s first tour following their new album. We find them in residence at Fort Worth, where they have fallen into a rut of fan service, singing long renditions of one song about the town, beefed up with tracts from Wikipedia and chants of \u201cFuck Dallas\u201d. It\u2019s comfortable but unfulfilling work, and they need to break out. The ensuing tour takes them to Wickie\u2019s home, where the group learns the truth about her hardscrabble upbringing (spoiler: her parents are good at Scrabble, which is hard) and visit a rich fan to be confronted about the casual insensitivity of their early-noughties hits. It\u2019s just as quick and absurd as it ever was. One joke about tooth whiteners might be the best we see on screen all year. Which isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s perfect, of course. The new season has got a little too giddy about being on Netflix, and has become improbably dirty in the process. It\u2019s jarring the first time a character says \u201cdick\u201d, purely because we had 16 episodes where nobody did that, but it\u2019s soon followed by a kaleidoscope of filthy language. I can\u2019t remember an American show that uses the C-word so readily (including once in a musical number). Which isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s morally wrong, but the series sits in such a heightened, sunny, day-glo space that the swearing can take you out of the world a little. Also, this might just be me, but the return of Girls5Eva has made me ever so slightly resentful that Netflix didn\u2019t also decide to renew Tina Fey and Robert Carlock\u2019s other lost masterpiece, Great News. But these are quibbles. Girls5Eva is back, and in this media landscape we should treat it as the miracle that it is. Now it\u2019s up to Netflix to keep making more of it.",

        "body": "Victoria Mapplebeck is a British director and lecturer who has worked in film, video, VR, user-generated content, and with her personal, revelatory projects she\u2019s shown a magic touch with a smartphone camera: she won a TV Bafta in 2019 for her iPhone short Missed Call, about her life as a single mum, working out her relationship with her teenage son and his absent dad. Now she has developed this into a tender, intimate, funny and entirely absorbing full-scale feature documentary, the title of which is a reference to the central circuit board on a computer \u2013 meaning perhaps both the importance of the digital equipment she\u2019s using to record everything, and her own central importance to the computer of their own family unit, the motherboard that isn\u2019t allowed to go wrong or take a day off. Motherboard is essentially a home video love letter to her son Jim that crafts 20 years\u2019 worth of footage, showing her own life and that of Jim growing surreally from a tiny baby into a fiercely opinionated, smart young adult who suddenly towers over the parent. The film lasts around 90 minutes, which is about how long the growing up process seems to take in real life for a parent. And at the same time she has to deal with exhaustion, a breast cancer diagnosis, anxiety and her own complex relationship with her father who walked out on the family when she was still young. Richard Linklater\u2019s famous time-lapse film, showing a kid growing up over three hours, was called Boyhood; Mapplebeck\u2019s could be called Motherhood or Sonhood or Lifehood. It is confessional, and hyperlocal in its 4K-rendered detail; it is a richly satisfying, humane, sympathetic study at the end of which I felt I knew Victoria and Jim as well as if they lived next door. Mapplebeck\u2019s camera seems always to be there, a fly on the wall of her own life: she appears dedicated \u2013 even ruthless \u2013 in her commitment to placing the camera where it can capture her, even in the most unflattering way. There is a startling, surreal shot of Mapplebeck having radiotherapy, the camera placed at her head and looking down her foreshortened body, glowing in a clinical light. She also gives us a brutally powerful confessional scene in which she says she wants to stay alive while Jim is still a child: \u201cI don\u2019t care when I die; I just want to see him get to adulthood.\u201d There is also something very touching in the insights she gets from Jim about his feelings on meeting with his dad: \u201cI\u2019m going to be sad; even if it goes well, I\u2019m still going to be sad.\u201d It\u2019s a film that works because it doesn\u2019t strain for anything other than its own personal record, and it has a marvellous humanity and warmth. \u2022 Motherboard screened at the Copenhagen documentary film festival",

        "body": "Idris Elba has shared details of his \u201cdream\u201d to turn an island off the coast of Sierra Leone, the country where his father was born, into an environmentally friendly smart city. The actor is working with his childhood friend to develop Sherbro, which is roughly the size of the Isle of Man, after the island was given enough autonomy by the west African nation\u2019s government to allow the work to go ahead. \u201cOriginally, we went there thinking how could we bring tourism to the most incredible 19 miles of beachfront,\u201d Elba told the BBC. But his friend Siaka Stevens said it became apparent Sierra Leone was not yet prepared for such an influx of tourists. Instead, the pair \u2013 who grew up together in east London \u2013 decided to embark on a more ambitious project. Their company, Sherbro Alliance Partners (SAP), has reached agreements with the Sierra Leonean government, as well as several major firms, to build an eco city as a public-private partnership. They have agreed a deal with the energy company Octopus to build Sierra Leone\u2019s first windfarm on the island, which lacks mains electricity and is a two-hour ferry trip from the mainland. Elba said a sustainable approach to developing the project would be central throughout the development. Equally important will be respecting local culture and sensibilities, with Elba expressing his hope to create a \u201cculturally diverse international city that blends African tradition, dynamism, and pride with state-of-the-art infrastructure and services\u201d. \u201cThe character of the island hopefully will remain intact. It\u2019s a beautiful, green part of the world and we don\u2019t want to disturb that,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s about being self-reliant, it\u2019s about bringing an economy that feeds itself and has growth potential. I\u2019m very keen to reframe the way Africa is viewed \u2026 as an aid model. This opportunity is completely different.\u201d He and Stevens have defined three key principles for the project. Among them is developing \u201cbased on African cultural values and principles, which prioritise community, collaboration, and respect for nature\u201d. They also said they planned to design the infrastructure in a way that was adaptable to \u201cchanging social, economic and environmental conditions\u201d and to follow \u201ceco city principles\u201d, such as building in a way that is \u201cenvironmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and resilient to climate change\u201d. Stevens said that the development on the island would be \u201cfuelled by clean energy sources\u201d. The pair said they had also sought to consult residents of the island; saying they have each visited several times to meet local leaders. Last month, Lloyds of London announced it was to take up a role in the project, but said at the time that Stevens and Elba\u2019s company was still in the process of putting together feasibility studies with the government of Sierra Leone. Elba and Stevens have said they hoped to break ground on the project within about a year of those studies starting, but they have stressed that this is a process that is likely to last decades. Feasibility is a key question for the project, for which SAP reportedly hopes to raise billions of dollars from various sources. The US-Senegalese singer Akon is another artist who announced a plan to build a futuristic city in his ancestral homeland. The first phase of his project was due to be completed by late last year. But, as the Guardian reported in December, the project has been beset by delays and controversy \u2013 with only a youth centre and the shell of what is planned to be the \u201cwelcome centre\u201d having been built so far. While Akon received praise for the planned city\u2019s Afrofuturistic aesthetic, there has been scepticism as to whether it will ever come to pass, fuelled by a lack of detail around the plans. Elba, for his part, has been clear about where his strengths lie. \u201cNever in my lifetime would I have thought I could build the foundation for a new smart-city \u2026 I\u2019m not qualified for that. But I am qualified to dream big,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream, you know, but I work in the make-believe business.\u201d He added: \u201cPart of me wants to build that beautiful retirement home for my mum.\u201d The actor told the broadcaster his late father would probably think the dream too big. But he said he would be proud, and tell his son \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do it, make sure you do it properly. You do it good, you do it with all your heart because that\u2019s the best you can do\u201d.",

        "body": "The moment Maybelle Blair took a decision \u2013 one she didn\u2019t know she was about to take \u2013 she says she \u201cfelt like all the blood rushed away from my head, down to my toes. I didn\u2019t know what was happening\u201d. Blair, the former baseball player in the postwar women\u2019s league which inspired the 1992 film A League of Their Own, was on stage at the 2022 Tribeca film festival in New York, since she had been involved in Amazon\u2019s TV adaptation. She looked around and wondered why she was still hiding. Although her sexuality had not been a secret among her teammates, she decided there and then to publicly come out at the age of 95. \u201cOut of the clear blue sky, I just blurted out \u2018I want everybody to know\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI was in the closet for 95 years. That old door blew open. I was sitting there, my eyes wide open, mouth open probably. I thought, \u2018Oh my God, after 95 years, you said that?\u2019 And I did. I wasn\u2019t afraid any more because I was so old and it really didn\u2019t matter, except for my family, what people thought.\u201d The audience cheered. \u201cAfterwards, I sat down and I had a beer and I tell you, I have never been so happy in all my life. I was a new girl at 95.\u201d She laughs, speaking on the phone from California. \u201cSo you might have me for 95 more years.\u201d It changed her life, she says. Now 97, she has been embraced by the LGBTQ+ community and invited to events, but what means the most to her is the people who tell her they have been inspired by her. \u201cThat made me feel so wonderful. So many people have told me how I helped them come out, and their families understand now what is going on in their lives.\u201d She hasn\u2019t had one person, \u201cto my face anyway\u201d, say anything negative. Blair played for the Peoria Redwings in the 1948 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season, then had a long career working for the aerospace company Northrop Corporation, where, at that time, she feared she would be fired if she was open about her sexuality. She was, she says, \u201cscared to death\u201d of anyone finding out the truth. \u201cIn those days, they had no sympathy for gay people. And I didn\u2019t know what my family would have thought. I couldn\u2019t do it. I had to go out on dates with men I didn\u2019t want to go out with. But I did \u2013 and I looked halfway decent, I think, because they kept asking me out. I just walked this straight and narrow path. It was hard sometimes, but I did it.\u201d She shrugged off comments from people wondering why she had never married, saying she hadn\u2019t found the right man. \u201cThat was my excuse.\u201d To finally be open changed her life, she says. \u201cYou have no idea. It was a new world for me.\u201d She wishes she had come out sooner, she says, but more than that, she wishes we had a society where she had felt able to: \u201cI would have liked to have come out right away if people would have accepted gay people.\u201d But now, she says, she has a new lease of life. \u201cThe music is playing real loud now for me, and every step I take is a little more lively now that I can be who I am.\u201d It has given her added energy to put into her current project: arranging for an international women\u2019s baseball centre to be built in Illinois. \u201cI think they should be able to have a home of their own for baseball. I\u2019ve got a few things I still have to do before I get six feet under.\u201d It is common, even desirable, to change your life in your 40s, 50s and 60s, but what is it like to embark on something new and different in your 90s? Edith Murway-Traina, who died last year at the age of 101, took up weightlifting in her 90s and became the oldest competitive power lifter at 99. Charles Eugster, a British dentist, started bodybuilding in his 80s and became a sprinter at 95; he died in 2017, at 97. Last month, David Marjot, 95, celebrated his graduation day at Kingston University, where he attained a master\u2019s in modern European philosophy, and is reportedly considering starting a PhD. These are the people showing it\u2019s never too late, and you\u2019re never too old. In 2022, Mildred Kirschenbaum became a social media star at the age of 99. She was on a cruise with her son and daughter to celebrate her birthday; her daughter, Gayle, posted a video of Kirschenbaum contemplating her age. She was lucky, she said, that \u201cI still have my marbles \u2026 and that I have a family who, I think, adores me. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d The video went viral. Then Kirschenbaum caught Covid, and in an update she told her fans, with typical verve, \u201cI am finished with this fucking Covid!\u201d In videos since then, she has sung, danced, reflected on her life and offered her thoughts, including on dealing with the hardships of childhood, and regrets (basically: don\u2019t dwell). She has recently published a book, Mildred\u2019s Mindset \u2013 part life advice, part memoir. Now 100, how does Kirschenbaum feel about becoming an influencer? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says, slightly tetchily from her home in Florida \u2013 she\u2019s waiting to be picked up to go to her bridge game. \u201cI just don\u2019t think about it. I don\u2019t think about dying or anything. It\u2019s like, que sera, whatever will be, will be.\u201d Has she always had a good attitude to ageing? \u201cI don\u2019t think about ageing, I really don\u2019t. I can\u2019t believe how old I am.\u201d She has, however, always tried to have a positive attitude and to do new things, she says. \u201cI\u2019ll try anything, it doesn\u2019t matter. Within reason \u2013 tell me to climb up a mountain, I\u2019ll say no.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t like it when other older people say, \u201cI can\u2019t do this and I can\u2019t do that. They decide they\u2019re old, that\u2019s it. You\u2019re never too old to try something new, to learn something. I learn something new every single day.\u201d Kirschenbaum was born in Brooklyn in 1923. You don\u2019t, she observed in one of her videos, get to live a long life without a lot of heartache along the way. Her sister died of pneumonia as a child, her father tried to take his own life during the Great Depression, and in more recent years, Kirschenbaum coped with the death of one of her adult children, and her husband (to whom she was married for more than 60 years). She isn\u2019t fazed by her newfound celebrity status. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care at all, one bit,\u201d says Gayle, who lives in New York. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t have all that much meaning to her. She cares about happy hour, and playing cards, and her family. A good cruise is important, too.\u201d Gayle, a film-maker and forgiveness coach, previously made a documentary about the transformation of their relationship, from \u201cdifficult\u201d to loving. \u201cMy mission is to keep her going and to make sure she\u2019s happy,\u201d says Gayle. \u201cI love that she brings joy to people and she inspires people. I joke that I created a monster but God forbid I say anything bad about her, because her fans will come after me. They worship her.\u201d We should remember, says David Sinclair, chief executive of the International Longevity Centre UK, that many of us, should we make it into our 90s, will not be lucky enough to grab all life\u2019s opportunities. \u201cDementia and frailty and disability are extraordinarily high among people in their 90s,\u201d he says. \u201cThat story you sometimes see of the 90-year-old skydiver is extraordinarily rare. There\u2019s that caveat we have to think about.\u201d But he would also like to see a society where people are encouraged to live full and interesting lives, and try new things, into their 90s and beyond. \u201cFar too often we say to people, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to bother any more\u2019. It\u2019s ageist and patronising. I think we\u2019ve got to have more of a sense of what are the rights and responsibilities we should have, across our lives.\u201d There is, he says, \u201ca perception that you shouldn\u2019t try something new, and I think there is a self-imposed ageism\u201d. It\u2019s not always easy to overcome that, but \u201cwe should be finding ways to support people\u201d. Promoting healthy lifestyles earlier, and social connectedness, are obviously vital \u2013 but so is access to opportunities, such as adult education, which has been slashed. When a maths course for mature students was made available by his local authority, Derek Skipper jumped at the chance. In 2022, he passed his GCSE maths at the age of 92 \u2013 more than 75 years after he took the equivalent in the 1940s. For a couple of hours a week, he learned over Zoom and looked up extra YouTube tutorials (both of those online platforms were new to him). \u201cI found I was quite enjoying it,\u201d says Skipper, now 94. \u201cThe things that I did at school, which I had forgotten, started to come back a little bit. I found I was understanding maths. It was interesting. Just to realise how clever it is, something I hadn\u2019t understood before.\u201d He would love others to do the same. \u201cWhat a great benefit it would be to the country in general if parents were able to go back to college, learn a bit of maths so they can encourage their children. So many people say, \u2018I was hopeless at maths.\u2019 They might suddenly find it\u2019s not quite as bad as they thought.\u201d It was enough for Skipper, who had a career as a salesman, to have taken the GCSE and he says he isn\u2019t planning to do anything else with it, even if he still enjoys plotting graphs in his spare time. It gave his brain a workout. \u201cThe maths course kept me much more interested than sitting down watching television. You feel as though you\u2019re achieving something, you\u2019re learning something.\u201d Last year, Bronwyn Herbert finished her PhD at the University of Queensland, Australia, at the age of 90, and is working out what she wants to do next. Though first, she says, she needs to tidy her study. \u201cAnd pick up some of the friendships that I probably didn\u2019t have time to work on. There\u2019s always some \u2018something\u2019 to do,\u201d she says. Herbert was pregnant when she was widowed at 23. After her daughter was born, the first of four children, she went back to live with her family and her brother, a lecturer, told her of a new course in social work his university was launching. \u201cWhen my baby girl was old enough, I went back to university and started doing social work.\u201d Aside from taking time to raise her children, Herbert spent her career in social work, only retiring at 81 so she could think about doing a PhD. She had worked a lot with homeless families, and over her long career had seen the effects of generational homelessness. \u201cI wondered what we could have done differently to prevent this occurring. When I researched it, there was very little to read about what homeless children or grownups thought about how their lives have been affected. There was a big gap in the literature. I decided I needed to investigate that. So that\u2019s how I came to start my thesis.\u201d She completed it despite several difficult and traumatic events \u2013 Herbert had a heart operation, then a fall that put her in hospital for three months. Her adult son died in an accident, and then her husband died. \u201cI lost interest in it for a while. Anyhow, I got going again and I completed it.\u201d She is, she says, \u201cvery happy to have finished it\u201d. What has she learned about following her dreams in her 90s? \u201cI think if I set out to do something, I\u2019ve always then achieved it as much as I possibly could. I was just very delighted to live this long to achieve it. There\u2019s always a lot of things to do in life.\u201d There are parts of her thesis that she would like to develop and work on further, particularly around effective and good parenting, but she is still thinking about it. \u201cI look forward to a new challenge. I don\u2019t know what it is yet, but I\u2019ll be ready for it.\u201d Herbert seems like a youngster compared to Sarah Yerkes, who published her first collection of poetry at 101. Yerkes has always been creative \u2013 she was a landscape architect, then a sculptor, working into her 80s until the physical effort of sculpting became too much. When she moved to a retirement community in Washington DC in her 90s, she joined a poetry writing group and in 2019 published a collection of her poetry, Days of Blue and Flame, with reflections on creativity, as well as more emotional experiences in her long life, including the death of her five-year-old son. Celebrating her 104th birthday in 2022, she said writing had meant \u201ca whole new world had opened up\u201d. It was a \u201cnew occupation and a new group of friends\u201d. Yerkes will be 106 next month, and isn\u2019t up for a phone call, nor for answering many of my questions relayed via one of her daughters. But she did say that, to her, poetry was like sculpture: \u201cPutting things together.\u201d Then she laughed and added, \u201cWhat a cop-out.\u201d I\u2019d asked how she would define a good life. \u201cLots of love,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd hang on to it.\u201d \u2022 Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "body": "One day a close friend of Sharon Stone\u2019s went for dinner with her family. The friend\u2019s father-in-law counselled that she should not choose pizza, since she had just had a baby and ought to lose weight. This incident inspired one of Stone\u2019s paintings, It\u2019s My Garden, Asshole: a gorgeous acrylic on canvas depicting a shimmering impressionistic garden held together with an undulating ground of salmon and De Kooning-esque pinks. So the father-in-law was the asshole, I ask? Not quite, explains the star during a video call from her California home. When Stone came to make the painting, a drone was hovering over her home. You can see a black smudge top left of the canvas. \u201cI was like, these people need to get the fuck out of our garden. They\u2019re so busy trying to spy on us that they don\u2019t even have any idea what\u2019s really happening.\u201d So this is angry painting, expressing outrage at patriarchal power and the erosion of privacy? \u201cNo! It\u2019s a love story!\u201d Stone explains that her friend had long struggled to have a child. \u201cWhen she had finally got her baby after going through so much, naturally she was upset at being told by some old white man to lose weight. I said to her \u2018Go tell him it is his last chance to be a grandfather and that you want him to love that child after everything it cost you.\u2019 And she did! And now they\u2019re best friends!\u201d Stone, 66, started painting during Covid when a friend gave her a paint-by-numbers book. Three years later she paints as much as 17 hours a day. She currently has a solo exhibition at a gallery in Berlin, and another opening in San Francisco next month. If that makes you feel like a slacker, console yourself with the thought that Stone would probably not have got gallery space were she not already famous. \u201cProbably not,\u201d concedes Stone, \u201cbut I would be more valuable if I were dead. If there is the possibility of a shorter life expectancy, that\u2019s a winner for female artists.\u201d Wait, what? She recalls taking her portfolio to a meeting with a New York gallery. \u201cAfter two hours I finally said, \u2018Are you gonna even look at my work?\u2019 And you know what he said? \u2018Are you planning to die soon?\u2019 So I said, \u2018I\u2019ve been sitting here for two hours listening to you and your friends for nothing?\u2019 \u2018Yes.\u2019\u201d Stone knows she could make big bucks if only she gave galleries what they wanted. \u201cJohnny Depp is printing pictures of people, putting some paint over it and signing it, and making a fortune,\u201d she says. (Two years ago, Depp\u2019s debut art collection Friends and Heroes, consisting of 780 screen prints of the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Bob Dylan and Keith Richards, sold for an estimated $3.65m.) \u201cI had galleries approach me and say, \u2018Could you please make prints of your face?\u2019 I think it\u2019s my duty not to do that. It\u2019s my job to open a window for other women and hold it open further.\u201d That is what she did as an actor, she says, and is now doing as an artist. She tells me she is asking $40,000 a piece for some of her paintings. Apart from anything else, buyers will get a lot of surface area for their money. Stone often works on a grand scale. Take her 2023 abstract diptych Amelia. A vertiginous neo-geometric composition, it was inspired by what it must have been like for the pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart \u201cto be in the plane so long by herself, day after day, hour after hour\u201d. A cool $40,000 is certainly more than the 25 bucks Stone used to charge for the paintings she made as a teenager to put her through school. Little Sharon got the art bug from her Aunt Vonne in smalltown Pennyslvania. Her parents, Dorothy and Joseph, were, their daughter relates in her memoir The Beauty of Living Twice, not so much \u201clace-curtain Irish\u201d as \u201ckitchen-sink Irish\u201d. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t come from a loving parental home. My parents came from being child slaves,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father lived in a barn from the age of four; my mother was given away when she was nine to be a housekeeper, laundress and cook.\u201d Their tough upbringings shaped Stone\u2019s own childhood and character. \u201cYou got your work done before you got to play, before you got to eat. And if you didn\u2019t, you got your butt pulled out of bed and you got knocked down the stairs.\u201d Aunt Vonne offered an escape from that harsh world and catalysed Stone\u2019s lifelong love of art. \u201cPainting was just another language I grew up knowing, like if you grow up in a musical family.\u201d She studied at nearby Edinboro University, but gave up art for modelling. \u201cI didn\u2019t get the impression I was going to be able to survive as a painter. I was offered modelling jobs at $5,000 a day. So I was thinking: 25 bucks or 5,000?\u201d Modelling took her to New York and made her part of the Studio 54 crowd. Then one day in 1980 she stood in line to be an extra in Woody Allen\u2019s Stardust Memories, and got the non-speaking role of \u201cpretty girl on train\u201d. Her breakthrough came 10 years later, in Paul Verhoeven\u2019s sci-fi head-scratcher Total Recall. Two years after that, she worked with the Dutch director again on the endearingly silly erotic thriller Basic Instinct \u2013 even though he incessantly called her Karen. \u201cRemember what Marilyn Monroe said,\u201d says Stone: \u201cWomen who seek to be equal with men lack ambition.\u201d The quote is probably apocryphal but it\u2019s obvious why she likes it. The most intriguing characters on Sharon Stone\u2019s CV are ambitious women who don\u2019t so much want to be equal to men as to kick their asses. \u201cI was playing pretty big characters,\u201d she agrees. \u201cAbsolutely. I was standing beside the men instead of behind them.\u201d The role of which she is most proud is Ginger McKenna in Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1995 Casino, which she played opposite Robert De Niro. \u201cBob encouraged me in every possible way. It was so amazing to me that he told me his performance depended on my performance. I just did everything I could possibly do to serve him because it was my wish to get to work with him, and it came true.\u201d Her acting career has not reached those heights since. \u201cI was shocked that I didn\u2019t get to continue to work well, because I did everything to be my very best.\u201d Certainly she\u2019s had well documented problems with Hollywood misogyny: she recently revealed that during filming of the 1993 film Sliver, Hollywood producer Robert Evans advised her to have sex with co-lead William Baldwin to improve his performance (whether Evans thought the same means would have improved hers is moot). One key reason she has been less prominent in Hollywood in recent years, though, is because in 2001, two weeks after 9/11, Stone suffered a stroke caused by a brain haemorrhage, an event that inspired the title of her autobiography. \u201cWhen a door closes, I have to open another one,\u201d she says. \u201cMy book\u2019s been sold in 22 countries so far.\u201d Now she\u2019s writing a novel. She\u2019s a devotee of the wisdom of comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell, whose philosophy, encapsulated in the slogan \u201cfollow your bliss\u201d, prompted Stone to move from movie set to easel. \u201cIt made me get some decent brushes and remember what I thought I\u2019d forgotten.\u201d You really didn\u2019t paint for nearly half a century? \u201cI couldn\u2019t. I worked 307 days a year. When I wasn\u2019t on set, I was flying to the press junkets. I was home six days one year, nine days another. So no. I didn\u2019t paint.\u201d But now she does. Very quickly she has amassed a body of work in which one can see the influences of Joan Mir\u00f3, Monet (there\u2019s even one called Giverny, inspired by a trip to the Frenchman\u2019s garden) and Kandinsky. Stone says that, like Kandinsky, she feels a spiritual charge when she paints \u2013 though of Russian artists, she most admires Rodchenko. The press release for Stone\u2019s latest show quotes art historian Martin Oskar Kramer\u2019s assessment of her oeuvre: \u201cAn expression of the feminine that is deeply in touch with natural forces and fundamentally untameable.\u201d That perhaps helps explain why, in her most figurative works, snakes figure so prominently. As we talk I notice a table lamp behind Stone has a snake support. \u201cSnakes completely change their skins and move on,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe ability to change is a symbol of how smart you are.\u201d The Berlin show is called Totem. \u201cTotems often serve as monuments to resilience and strength,\u201d says Stone. \u201cThese paintings feel totemic to me. My daily art-making helps me fight my way out from under the weight of this alarming time we are all living through.\u201d Among the paintings she\u2019s exhibiting currently is one called Please Don\u2019t Step on the Grass. It was inspired by trips to Israel in 2006, and takes on new resonance since the 7 October attacks in Israel and subsequent devastation of Gaza. Its subjects are borders, invasions and the folly of conquest. \u201cBefore we start killing and maiming and wounding thousands of women and children, we need big brains, more emotional intelligence, not more small-penis energy. My painting is about all that.\u201d Is she happier as a painter than an actor? \u201cI\u2019m not saying that. Working as an actress, I absolutely loved it. If someone offers me a substantial role, I\u2019m going to take it. But that\u2019s not happening.\u201d Why not? \u201cWhat happens in the business is that once you become a huge seller, they want to put you in small projects, so that you start financing people who want to start their careers. Terrific, but that\u2019s not really where I\u2019m at. I want to work with the masters because I have earned my place there.\u201d She insists on being creative while her acting career is on hold. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to continue to be artistically creative, to let that faucet flow, so that your art stays ever present and modern.\u201d As if to prove the point, she tells me she\u2019s planning to spend the rest of the day on a painting for her new San Francisco show. She\u2019s in no hurry to go back to acting on other people\u2019s terms. \u2022 Sharon Stone: Totem is at Galerie Deschler, Berlin, until 18 May \u2022 Sharon Stone: My Eternal Failure opens at Gallery 181 at 181 Fremont Residences, San Francisco, on 11 April",

We have continued to share our home and lives, and have become even closer friends as we grow older (we are now in our 70s) and in greater need of each other\u2019s support and care. The question of how we name our relationship still eludes us, and we know of few others in a similar position, so can only applaud Cohen\u2019s determination to show the strength of commitment in the many, but still largely invisible, relationships like ours. Katherine Holden and Helen Kendall Bath \u2022 How this article resounded with me. I\u2019m in the midst of huge grief over the loss of a friend of 40 years. We spoke or met every day. She nominated me \u201cher person\u201d at her death; I was with her throughout. My husband has post-traumatic stress disorder, which means he is emotionally absent most of the time.

        "body": "Over the last two years Paul Lewis has been working his way through Schubert\u2019s piano sonatas, and he has now reached the fourth and last programme in his series. Logically enough it is devoted to the final three sonatas, in C minor, D958, A major D959, and in B flat, D960, a triptych that Schubert completed in September 1828, two months before his death. Lewis is a wonderfully unfussy and straightforwardly lucid interpreter of these great works, judicious with his rubato, and never imposing unnecessary mannerisms on the music; whether structurally or texturally everything is consistently uncluttered. Turner Sims is a fine hall for piano recitals, and Lewis made the most of its clarity. And just as importantly, he was always at pains to allow the music the expressive space it requires, whether giving full weight to the silences that play such an important role in late Schubert, or letting the twists and shifts of the harmony work their magic. That harmonic awareness was just as important here in the closing bars of the A major\u2019s opening movement, where its assertive opening theme is finally recalled, but robbed of all its vigour, as it was in the moments of maximum intensity, such as the angry outbursts in the recitative-like sections of the same sonata\u2019s slow movement. With the possible exception of the B flat sonata\u2019s tinkling scherzo, there are very few unclouded passages in any of these works, but Lewis never overdid the anguish, so that when it did well up to the surface, its impact was all the greater. After such outstanding accounts of the first two sonatas, though, the performance of the B flat after the interval was not quite on the same compelling level. There was just a hint of routine about the unfolding of the long first movement, while the tolling of the Andante was not quite as heart-rending as it can be. But this is to measure it against the standard that Lewis had previously set himself and that was a very high mark indeed. The concert is repeated at the Wigmore Hall, London, on 22 and 24 March",

As well as excelling at whatever she turns her hand to, Beverley has done so much to be a voice for the voiceless \u2013 including as a consistent ally for the LGBT+ community and those living with HIV. But the stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV isn\u2019t a historical issue. As Beverley explains, headlines about a \u201cgay disease\u201d were commonplace in the 1980s and 90s, but there\u2019s still a huge amount to do to update the public\u2019s knowledge on HIV today. Despite the UK aiming to be the first country in the world to end new HIV cases, by 2030, our recent polling on public knowledge and attitudes makes for pretty grim reading. We found that just a third of people would be happy to kiss someone living with HIV, and almost half would be ashamed to tell others they were HIV positive. Only a third knew the stigma-busting fact that those living with HIV and on effective treatment cannot pass HIV on to partners. The reality is that we\u2019ve made incredible progress in preventing, testing and treating HIV in the last 40 years. You can live a long, healthy life with HIV. You can have children who are HIV negative. Effective treatment means HIV cannot be passed on. But public perceptions haven\u2019t kept up with the pace of change. We\u2019re determined to change that, and we\u2019re hugely proud to have our patron Beverley by our side. Richard Angell Chief executive, Terrence Higgins Trust",

        "body": "Mary Jean Chan, Caleb Azumah Nelson and AK Blakemore are among the shortlistees for this year\u2019s Swansea University Dylan Thomas prize. The award, worth \u00a320,000, celebrates poetry, novels, short stories and drama by writers aged 39 and under in honour of the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, who died at that age. Ay\u1ecd\u0300b\u00e1mi Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u1ecd\u0300, Catherine Lacey and Joshua Jones also made the shortlist. Jones was the only debut author selected, with his short story collection Local Fires, inspired by real events and people in his home town of Llanelli, south Wales. The collection \u201cevokes the inertia, stagnation, and vanished innocence of a post-industrial landscape,\u201d said judging chair and writer Namita Gokhale. Chan, the only poet on the shortlist, was chosen for their collection Bright Fear, which explores identity, multilingualism and postcolonial legacy. \u201cWritten with a quiet intimacy, Mary Jean Chan\u2019s second collection hums with gentle, inviting and formally inventive poetry\u201d, said judge and writer Tice Cin. Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u1ecd\u0300 was shortlisted for A Spell of Good Things, in which \u201cdomestic strife and the political tensions of modern Nigeria bristle against each other\u201d, wrote Michael Donkor in a Guardian review of the novel. The six-strong shortlist was selected from a longlist of 12, which also featured Penance by Eliza Clark, The Coiled Serpent by Camilla Grudova, Hungry Ghosts by Kevin Jared Hosein, Close to Home by Michael Magee, Open Up by Thomas Morris and Divisible By Itself and One by Kae Tempest. Nelson was shortlisted for Small Worlds, a novel set between London and Ghana across three summers and described as \u201cdeeply loving and rhythmically moving\u201d by Cin. Joining Cin and Gokhale on the judging panel are the writers Jon Gower, Se\u00e1n Hewitt and Julia Wheeler. The winner of the prize will be revealed at a ceremony held in Swansea, Thomas\u2019s home town, on Thursday, 16 May. Blakemore was shortlisted for The Glutton, a historical novel inspired by the story of Tarare, a French peasant living through the French Revolution whose insatiable hunger made him a freak show attraction. \u201cThis is clearly a tale that begs to be fictionalised, and it\u2019s hard to think of a better writer to do it than Blakemore,\u201d said Sandra Newman in a Guardian review. Completing the shortlist was Lacey\u2019s Biography of X, which chronicles the life and secrets of an enigmatic artist. \u201cThere is so much that\u2019s impressive about this book,\u201d wrote Marcel Theroux in a Guardian review. \u201cIt makes you think afresh about America and American history. It roves over the muddy trenches of identity politics while saying things that are original and not parti pris.

        "body": "The ending of 1985\u2019s Super Mario Bros, soundtracked by the iconic bleeps and blips of the 8-bit NES, has Mario finally finding the princess, who has been in another castle for the whole game. As the moustachioed hero leaps to her side, a text bubble reveals the name of our digitised damsel in distress: Princess Peach. She gives her thanks, the credits roll, and we bid her farewell. As you\u2019ll know if you watched Anna Taylor-Joy\u2019s performance in last year\u2019s Mario movie, the Mushroom Kingdom\u2019s monarch is rather less one-dimensional these days \u2013 as you\u2019d hope, given how video games and feminism have progressed over the past 40 years. But this is only the second game in which she has had a starring role, the first since 2005\u2019s DS game Super Princess Peach. Showtime puts Nintendo\u2019s pink princess literally in the spotlight, as a trip to the theatre goes awry and she must take to the stage to save the dramatic arts from \u2026 evil grapes? It\u2019s a strange but enjoyable setup, allowing Peach to dive into a litany of genre-themed side-scrolling levels. From sneaking through grass and running along rooftops as a dagger-clutching ninja Peach, to galloping on horseback across train tracks and lassoing bandits, each new theatrical backdrop offers the heroine another stage play to star in. It\u2019s all impressively handsome, too. With well-animated, screen-filling bosses and charmingly rendered cakes, Showtime\u2019s colourful visuals are delightful. Yet it only takes a few minutes of play before repetition sinks in. From mashing a button to stir cake mix as Patisserie Peach, to the simplistic jumping and combat that defines everything from swordfighting to superhero fisticuffs, Showtime\u2019s gameplay is thinner than the Paper Mario. A rare highlight here is the two ice-skating levels, which see a leotard-clad Peach carving her way across a whimsical winter wonderland. An action-packed kung fu vignette offers up a few smiles, too, the visuals lending an enjoyable level of kitsch to its rudimentary pummelling pastiche. The problem is, where the house of Mario normally nails the balance between depth and accessibility, Showtime feels shallow. Whether it\u2019s the diabolical mermaid levels or the laughably incomplete investigations of Detective Peach, many of these potentially fun ideas feel like prototypes that prematurely escaped Nintendo HQ. Last year\u2019s Super Mario Wonder was a delight for all ages, but Princess Peach: Showtime has little to offer those of us who have mastered our times tables. Its gorgeously scripted cinematic moments and visual variety provide colour and pomp, but it\u2019s a royal shame that the inventive animations and narrative setup aren\u2019t accompanied by the same level of gameplay innovation. Despite the enjoyable premise and high production values, Peach\u2019s long-awaited star turn feels disappointingly patronising, one-dimensional and forgettable \u2013 the polar opposite of the Super Mario Bros film\u2019s capable heroine. As the Nintendo Switch enters its twilight years, this was the perfect moment to give the Mushroom Kingdom monarch the celebration she so thoroughly deserved. Yet where Kirby received a Mario-worthy, Iliad-esque epic in Forgotten Land, this is more akin to a flimsy pop-up book. \u2022 Princess Peach: Showtime is out now; \u00a349.99",

        "body": "This year\u2019s surprise hit at the box office has been Bob Marley: One Love. The biopic of the reggae icon has grossed over $170m and counting, meaning it\u2019s only behind Kung Fu Panda 4 and Dune: Part Two in 2024 receipts. Next month sees the release of Back to Black, an Amy Winehouse biopic that is expected to perform strongly on the back of a slew of free promo for its questionable likenesses and ghoulish portrayal of the ill-fated singer. Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, Grateful Dead, Billy Joel, Boy George, Maria Callas, Linda Ronstadt, Fred Astaire, Carole King, George Michael, Bee Gees, Keith Moon and the Beatles (times four, one for each member) \u2013 all have biopics about them due in the coming months. While Hollywood today is dominated by sequels, remakes and comic book extended universes, 2023 saw the decline of the superhero movie. While the summer slate is still headlined by a couple of comic book titles (notably Deadpool &amp; Wolverine and Joker 2) it does appear that audience demand has peaked and that the superhero movie is finally going \u201cthe way of the western\u201d as predicted by Steven Spielberg a decade ago. Forever in search of a new trend capable of buffeting their revenues, studios are increasingly looking towards music biopics to provide reliable income (theatrical chains expect this year\u2019s North American box office to be down 11% on 2023\u2019s strong performance). Although grounded in reality and often featuring mature themes (plenty of sex and drugs amid the rock\u2019n\u2019roll) music biopics ape superhero movies in that they come steeped in mythology, and with an eager audience of already devoted fans baked in, essentially allowing the studios to have their cake (compete for awards) and eat it (cash out). In essence, 20th-century pop culture represents an extended universe that studios and film-makers can mine for profit. It doesn\u2019t hurt that these films typically don\u2019t cost a bomb, with most of the budget going on music rights. Not that you necessarily need to shell out for the actual songs: Nowhere Boy, England is Mine, and Stardust show you can work around the lack of hits by focusing on the origin story. What\u2019s more these films have the potential for huge upside if they can find a large audience beyond fans. Prior to Oppenheimer, Bohemian Rhapsody ($910m) was the highest-grossing biopic of all time and Elvis, Rocketman and Straight Outta Compton all performed brilliantly relative to their $40m to $80m budgets. Music biopics also represent a way of keeping actor fees to a minimum \u2013 Austin Butler only got a reported $700,000 for portraying Elvis. Of course, the best ones feature a lead actor capable of embodying a legendarily charismatic star but the presence of a marquee \u201ccharacter\u201d to some extent ameliorates the need for a huge star. In this sense, biopics mirror superhero movies \u2013 they may be huge stars now but Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans and Tom Holland were not exactly massive names prior to getting cast as marquee fictional characters. Perhaps having Elvis or Bob Marley\u2019s name on the poster means it doesn\u2019t matter if the person playing them is a relative no mark. While some of these films received criticism for being formulaic, hitting recurrent beats such as the artist suffering at the hands of sceptical parents or the band coming together for the first time, before inevitably falling out over the frontman\u2019s outsized share of the glory, they create opportunities for fan service (and parody as in the underrated biopic Weird: The Al Yankovic story). They also create space for more experimental cinema such as Todd Haynes\u2019 Bob Dylan biopic, I\u2019m Not There (with Cate Blanchett\u2019s performance representing a template for how a successful performance need not be a perfect imitation). And just like a superhero, music stars can be recast and reconfigured. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s take on Bob Dylan is just around the corner. With fan speculation already rife as to who Mendes will cast in his forthcoming Beatles tetralogy (with an individual film devoted to each of the Fab Four, creating a shared universe more commonly found in \u2026 superhero movies) it seems the music biopic will remain as a highly profitable Hollywood staple for a few years at least. But whether fans will truly have the appetite for four separate flicks will probably be a defining acid test as to whether they can deliver the sustained success that superhero movies have over the past few decades.

        "body": "For Stephen Northey, an environmental advocate in Melbourne, tree planting and urban revegetation has allowed him to help restore degraded local ecosystems and foster a much-needed connection with his local area. The community leader spearheaded a campaign to save Edgars Creek, a tributary that runs through the basalt plains linking Epping, Thomastown and Reservoir to Merri Creek in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs. \u201cSeventeen years ago, the Edgar\u2019s Creek corridor was a wasteland of noxious weeds,\u201d he says. \u201cYet hiding there was a beautiful watercourse flowing along a natural rocky course with pockets of remnant vegetation still surviving. I thought the place deserved better so I organised a meeting in the neighbourhood house to garner interest and a community group was formed.\u201d From an initial meeting, locals undertook thousands of hours of volunteer work using only indigenous plants grown from seeds collected from the catchment. Indigenous bushland and a wetland habitat was successfully reintroduced over the industrial wasteland, preventing the area from being sold to developers after a concerted community campaign. \u201cCare, vision and inclusion were key success factors, as was access to knowledge about how healthy ecosystems function at a local scale,\u201d he says. Aside from the deep satisfaction of restoring a natural environment, the project transformed the lives of those who participated, says Northey, especially during Covid lockdowns. \u201cPeople want to be custodians for their local environment. Friends groups can help facilitate and encourage that desire; that need. In fact, more than ever we need opportunities to connect with our planet and each other,\u201d he says. How to get involved in tree planting in your area Tree-planting initiatives are taking place all over Australia, but one of the largest is Plant Trees Australia, organised through Carbon Positive Australia, which provides a platform for volunteers to connect with community groups and offers resources on upcoming tree-planting projects. \u201cTree planting is essential to combat climate change and restore healthy ecosystems, so why would you not want to get on board,\u201d says Lauren Purcell, the communications and partnerships coordinator for Carbon Positive Australia. Her organisation surveys existing bushland to identify naturally occurring plant species to replant in selected areas of remnant bushlands. \u201cOur projects often include more than 50 native species and include shrubs, ground cover and other understory species that help support the natural ecosystem,\u201d she says. Given Australia currently ranks fourth worst in the world for land clearing and has among the worst species extinction rates globally, these projects provide a counterpoint to the mass land clearing taking place across Australia, she says. \u201cRehabilitating cleared and degraded land can be challenging, particularly as the climate continues to change,\u201d says Purcell. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial that these projects use local seed collections to promote local species, connect remaining bush and forests, and monitor and maintain the new growth, especially during the initial stages.\u201d What to plant at home in urban Australian settings While community-based regeneration projects are vital for restoring degraded habitats, for an increasing number of people the desire to get our hands dirty and improve our local environment starts in our own back yard. Patrick Belford, urban horticulturist and director of Inner City Nature in Melbourne, says a good place to start at home is by replacing grass lawns and nature strips with living ecosystems that will make gardens more biodiverse, encourage insects and native birds, and reduce the need for polluting and noisy lawn mowing. \u201cSmall trees on the north and northern western aspects of a dwelling can create immediate microclimate changes. Deciduous trees and climbing plants on structures play a part in passively cooling and protecting a dwelling in summer and letting the sun warm it in winter,\u201d he says. Native trees will also support local birdlife and are able to adapt to harsh weather conditions, he says, recommending trees such as coral gum (Eucalyptus torquata), fuchsia gum (Eucalyptus forrestiana) or willow myrtle (Agonis flexuosa) for local Australian gardens. \u201cReplacing lawns with garden beds and plantings will reduce the need for mowing, and create habitat for pollinating insects that feed the entire food system,\u201d says Belford. What is \u2018rewilding\u2019 and how does it help? The urge towards nature immersion, tree planting and urban regeneration is not new, but as the climate crisis worsens it has taken on a new relevance and urgency. According to Claire Dunn, author of the book Rewilding the Urban Soul, the human rewilding movement seeks to actively counter the ill effects of urban over-domestication and alienation from nature by returning a quality of wildness and earth-centredness to the way we live and how we understand our place on the the planet. \u201cIn these times of despair and uncertainty, planting a tree is hope in action, the kind of hope that comes not from wishful thinking but by taking actions, maybe small, in support of change,\u201d she says. \u201cAnyone who has spent time with a tree old enough to be their great-great-grandmother will know its value beyond carbon. They\u2019re elders, and remind us of forest time, that is much much longer than the election cycles. We need to drink from these deeper wells in times like these.\u201d",

        "body": "For the royal family, Catherine has been a dream princess. After the turbulent years of Diana and Sarah Ferguson, the royals were delighted when William became romantically involved with the nice, middle-class girl from the home counties when the pair were studying at St Andrews University. Since then, there has been a fairytale wedding, three healthy children, and a princess to be proud of: calm, cheerful and devoted to her job as wife and mother to the future king and his siblings. After her cancer diagnosis, made public on Friday, William, the children, her parents and her in-laws will be coming to terms with a serious health crisis and an uncertain future in the glare of global media coverage. No wonder she wanted privacy. Catherine and William met in 2001 when she took part in a charity student fashion show that the prince attended. The following year, they shared a student flat with two others. At this point they were just friends. That changed over the following months and years, and by the time they graduated in 2005 they were a couple. But in 2007, they took a few months out from their relationship. Catherine later said: \u201cI think I at the time wasn\u2019t very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person \u2026 You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn\u2019t realised \u2026 I really valued that time for me as well although I didn\u2019t think it at the time, looking back on it.\u201d The break didn\u2019t last. In March 2008, the couple were photographed on the ski slopes in Klosters, and in October 2010 William proposed while on a trip to Kenya. \u201cI just decided it was the right time really,\u201d he said later. \u201cWe\u2019d been talking about marriage or a while, so it wasn\u2019t a massively big surprise.\u201d Marriage was an enormous commitment, and not just to one another. For Catherine, it meant her life would be lived in the public eye, under constant scrutiny and immense pressure to deliver for the royal family. She knew how challenging it would be. William and Kate married on 29 April 2011 in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey that was broadcast around the world. Two years later, after a pregnancy blighted by severe morning sickness, she gave birth to her first son, George. Charlotte followed in 2015 and Louis in 2018. The Princess of Wales has issued frequent updates about her family life. During the Covid pandemic, she spoke in a BBC interview about the challenges of parenting through lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s been ups and downs, like a lot of families self-isolating,\u201d she said. On their 10th wedding anniversary, the couple posted a video of themselves and their children walking through sand dunes in Norfolk, thanking people for their well wishes. Other photos and messages were posted online at Christmas, Mother\u2019s Day and anniversaries. It has not been all smooth sailing. Catherine and the Duchess of Sussex were said to have a fractious relationship, perhaps contributing to the growing distance between William and Harry. She and her father-in-law \u2013 then Prince Charles, now the king \u2013 were named in the Dutch version of a book as the members of the royal family who had allegedly discussed how dark the skin of Harry and Meghan\u2019s unborn child might be. But public affection for the Princess of Wales has been remarkable. She has been widely praised for her sunny demeanour, charity work, fashion sense, parenting skills and informality. When it was announced in January that she had planned abdominal surgery, speculation about her health inevitably took off. The surgery had been successful, said Kensington Palace, and she would spend some weeks recovering at home. \u201cThe Princess of Wales appreciates the interest this statement will generate,\u201d it said. \u201cShe hopes the public will understand \u2026 her wish that her personal medical information remains private.\u201d After weeks of hysterical speculation and wild conspiracy theories, that period of privacy has come to an end. It had been \u201can incredibly tough couple of months\u201d for her and her family, she said in her video statement released on Friday. No doubt, it will continue to be tough for some time to come, but public sympathy will be unbounded.",

        "body": "\u2018I remember I would rush home from school just to play RollerCoaster Tycoon,\u201d recalls John Burton, a senior creative lead at Merlin Entertainments (the owner of UK-based theme parks including Alton Towers, Chessington World of Adventures, and Legoland Windsor) and the man designing the forthcoming 236ft (72-metre) drop Hyperia rollercoaster at Thorpe Park. \u201cI would then go to sleep dreaming I could become the next Walt Disney.\u201d When he reflects on the game, the adult Burton speaks with the excitement of a teenager on a sugar high. \u201cI learned so much about how rollercoaster systems work with their block zones, or even the little tricks of the trade at theme parks like adding side queues and strategically placed toilets,\u201d he continues, confirming my suspicion that the Jumanji-themed jungle world he helped to design for Chessington has what he calls \u201csubconscious similarities\u201d to the classic PC game\u2019s Jolly Jungle scenario. \u201cIf I have to travel to a theme park abroad for work, I still load up the original game on the plane and sketch out ideas. I never really stopped playing.\u201d Released 25 years ago today, RollerCoaster Tycoon (the biggest selling PC game of 1999) achieved viral success before online virality was an established thing, inspiring countless geo-site forum communities where users could share designs and re-creations of their favourite real-life rides. These communities persist even today, with one designer recently creating a nightmarish existential rollercoaster that takes a sickening 12 years to complete. Selling 700,000 copies in its first year, the 1999 theme park strategy game RollerCoaster Tycoon helped keep its publisher Atari alive and kicking. Today is its 25th anniversary. RollerCoaster Tycoon didn\u2019t just give millions of fans an infinite toolbox of fun to build the theme parks of their candified dreams (more on this later), but helped to demystify the whole adjacent theme park industry, and make it less male dominated. \u201cFor years and years, I remember being the only woman working on rollercoaster projects,\u201d says Candy Holland, executive creative director at Legoland resorts and an industry stalwart who helped design the world\u2019s first vertical drop rollercoaster, Oblivion, at Alton Towers. \u201cBut when RollerCoaster Tycoon came out, we suddenly had a surge of young women applying for jobs. They were utilising RollerCoaster Tycoon to build their understanding of what, I guess, was previously seen as a pretty niche industry.\u201d One of those young women was Flora Lui, senior project manager for Merlin\u2019s \u201cmagic making\u201d team in California. Unlike so many of the games from its era (Resident Evil, GoldenEye 007), she argues that RollerCoaster Tycoon traded death and destruction fantasies for joyous creativity, and therefore attracted male and female players. \u201cPlaying RollerCoaster Tycoon was radical,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember I would change the colours so all my rides were pink. I\u2019d spend a lot of time making queues that were more like mazes, which hilariously confused the customers, and I would show my parents all the designs, too. As a project manager I must consider the push and pull of a budget; the effect of increased visitation; safety; managing guest flow, and delivering magic. Sometimes when I\u2019m in meetings, considering all these things, I remember how RollerCoaster Tycoon led me down this path.\u201d From the tranquil Leafy Lake to the more exhilarating Haunted Harbour and Diamond Heights, each of the game\u2019s 21 scenarios was about finding quick solutions to dilemmas and creating a theme park capable of giving pixelated punters the times of their lives. \u201cThe game\u2019s success really kept the Atari business going,\u201d admits Atari\u2019s CEO, Wade Rosen. \u201cI think the fact that you could build these really intricate rollercoasters, or completely ignore all of that and launch [customers] into a lake or see how many of them you could nauseate, was really the genius of it\u201d Everyone who played it had a \u201cdifferent experience\u201d, Rosen argues, and he says the canvas of creativity present in RollerCoaster Tycoon was practically a prototype for Minecraft later on. He was a ruthlessly capitalistic player, he says. \u201cI really liked the business aspects of it \u2026 When it was raining, I\u2019d quickly put up the prices on umbrellas. I\u2019d be like, now it\u2019s $20. And then you\u2019d bring in a bunch of cash.\u201d The game eventually sold well over 6m copies worldwide, becoming the launchpad for a successful franchise \u2013 despite the fact that, at the time, its 2D isometric graphics stood out like a sore thumb among the fast-improving 3D graphics that characterised 1999\u2019s big hitters. \u201cThe graphical style is now seen as whimsical and unique instead of outdated and restrictive, like it was back then,\u201d the game\u2019s Scottish creator, Chris Sawyer, says. \u201cAnd, perhaps because the focus was much less on graphical detail and immersiveness, it was possible to put more depth and detail into the actual gameplay. \u201cFrom an early age I\u2019ve always enjoyed building things with Lego, often trains or mechanical machines, but always with that freedom to do things your own way and to try things out to see what works. RollerCoaster Tycoon\u2019s roots possibly come from that \u2013 a desire to have something simulated on the computer where you could build your own designs from scratch and try things out, and generally just learn what works and what doesn\u2019t, and what\u2019s fun or not fun to ride.\u201d Having created the critically acclaimed but commercially lukewarm Transport Tycoon, Sawyer began researching RollerCoaster Tycoon around 1996. Ironically, he grew up terrified of rollercoasters after becoming convinced his cart on The Scenic wooden ride in Great Yarmouth would derail during a childhood visit. At first, he thought a theme park game might be \u201ctoo niche\u201d, but after finally falling in love with thrill-seeking rides as an adult, he knew he had landed on a special idea. He started touring the world\u2019s greatest theme parks and taking notes. \u201cPerhaps the game\u2019s enduring interest is down to it appealing to players\u2019 nurturing instincts \u2013 we all like to build or create something of our own and then look after it, improve it, make sure it looks good and works well and grows well, and that\u2019s the crux of this game,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other aspect of the game which perhaps stands out is that it still remains one of very few games which is almost completely positive \u2013 you\u2019re rewarded for good design and management rather than destroying things, and fundamentally the game is all about keeping your little guests happy.\u201d Huge sales aside, Sawyer said he knew RollerCoaster Tycoon had made an impact on the world when he visited a theme park in the US in the early 2000s. \u201cI remember seeing a whole series of food stalls in a small theme park which looked just like RollerCoaster Tycoon food stalls, with giant items of food or drink modelled on top \u2013 that felt quite eerie.\u201d When I tell about the real-life rollercoaster designers I spoke to for this feature, he seems a little surprised. \u201cI would feel quite proud if my games had actually steered some of them towards their careers,\u201d he replies. Yet while RollerCoaster Tycoon set Burton and Lui off on their career paths, they are both keen to highlight that the game doesn\u2019t get everything right about theme-park design. \u201cReal life rollercoasters aren\u2019t set in a grid; you can be way more flexible,\u201d says Burton. \u201cIn the game it costs \u00a350 to place a piece of track down. I wish it was \u00a350, as I could build the longest rollercoaster in the world. The reality is these are million-pound investments. The speed of the rollercoasters aren\u2019t possible in real life either \u2013 the G-forces would kill a real person.\u201d Lui, meanwhile, says that if she dared to recreate some of the zigzag queues she made in the game as a child, she\u2019d probably be sacked. \u201cThe greatest rides are the ones that tell a story,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reality is there are hundreds of people from different departments putting rollercoasters together.\u201d If you\u2019ve been on a real-life rollercoaster lately, maybe it was designed by a millennial who grew up playing RollerCoaster Tycoon. According to Rosen of Atari, the series will soon expand with a new 3D entry, but the game\u2019s original creator, Sawyer, says he has no interest remaking the original two games with next-gen graphics. Whatever the future holds for the series, Burton of Merlin is just happy it was RollerCoaster Tycoon he got drawn into in 1999, rather than the year\u2019s other paradigm-shifting game: Pok\u00e9mon on the Game Boy. \u201cThe game just gave you complete freedom; there were no rules,\u201d Burton says. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, because one of the things that helped me get a job at Merlin was recreating the Alton Towers Nemesis ride on RollerCoaster Tycoon and showing it at my interview. Now I am working on the new Nemesis Reborn rollercoaster. It\u2019s mind-blowing how a video game inspired me to become a real-life rollercoaster creator.\u201d",

        "body": "Leah Hunt-Hendrix and Astra Taylor\u2019s new book, a galvanising examination of the history of solidarity and how we can use it today to shape a fair and sustainable future, was born out of friendship. But the pair are from distinctly different backgrounds. Taylor is a Canadian-born writer, film-maker, musician and activist (the pair prefer the term organiser, more of which later) who grew up in Athens, Georgia. Hunt-Hendrix is an activist, too, as well as a political theory scholar and granddaughter of a Texas oil billionaire. She grew up on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, spending summers in Dallas. The two women met at Occupy Wall Street in 2011. They first wrote together in 2015, creating a technology issue for the Nation magazine and, says Hunt-Hendrix, \u201cdecided we were great collaborators and that was something we wanted to keep doing\u201d. They started writing Solidarity during lockdown, but publication was delayed because their original publisher, Verso, was in dispute with its union, so they decided to switch in solidarity with Verso\u2019s workers. As they finally gear up for their book tour, they sit and talk \u2013 Taylor, who is visiting family in North Carolina; Hunt-Hendrix at home in New York, a little croaky from the interrupted nights of new motherhood \u2013 about what solidarity means to them and why beating polarisation is our only hope. How did you come to collaborate? Leah Hunt-Hendrix: I thought Astra was the coolest. The first time we talked one-to-one was when she was organising a telethon for the Rolling Jubilee Fund, which raised money to buy and cancel tens of millions of dollars of debt. I think she may have then invited me to a meeting for Strike Debt, which was an Occupy [Wall Street] spin-off. Astra Taylor: I respected Leah out of the gate for the way she engaged during Occupy. There were many factions and divisions in that messy but important movement, and I certainly took note of folks I felt were committed and serious about trying to build power over the longer haul. Occupy was a school as well as a protest. I was a kid who was always interested in social justice, and when Occupy erupted I was like: the movement might not be perfect, but it\u2019s calling attention to the crisis of democracy, to inequality. LHH: Occupy was an amazing experience. Solidarity was a very prominent term there, but when I went back to the Princeton library to see what had been written about it, there was so little, so I ended up writing about it for my PhD dissertation. I went on to build an organisation called Solidaire \u2013 a fund to help resource social movements. I was so inspired by Astra\u2019s work, having learned how the concept of solidarity came from a financial term in ancient Rome for mutually held debts. Rather than being a fluffy concept of \u201clet\u2019s all get along\u201d, it was about organising debtors. AT: When she told me about her dissertation and the etymology of solidarity, I remember having a kind of A-ha! moment. We had collaborated on enough stuff to know that we worked well together and that we would have an intellectual adventure doing [the book] \u2013 and we did. You talk about organising as key to solidarity, but what does organising mean to you? LHH: Organising is a practice of getting involved with other people, choosing a problem that you want to address, and working together to try to overcome that problem. Whether it\u2019s trying to cancel student debt, or my first experience with organising in college, when I joined a campaign to get a living wage for city employees. AT: It\u2019s useful to contrast organising with activism. I can be an activist by myself by raising awareness, tweeting a lot. LHH: Tweeting is not organising. AT: Organising pushes against the idea that we can do this on our own, and that we win just by protesting. It\u2019s not just about all showing up in the street one time and a big display of shared aspirations. You need to dig in for the long haul and coordinate with other people and build a power block. People don\u2019t have a lot of opportunities in our lives to organise precisely because there\u2019s been a centuries-long war on solidarity. We have to teach each other, begin where you are with a few friends and take those baby steps. There really is no alternative. You say friends, but in the book you describe movements such as Occupy as being much broader than that. AT: I think that that matters so much. We both want to be part of movements that are majoritarian, inclusive in the sense that there\u2019s all kinds of folks from different walks of life coming together. I\u2019d been on the left in New York City for a while but I didn\u2019t know everybody at Occupy. A lot of them were younger than me. I grabbed on to that opportunity, forming the Debt Collective, which is the union of debtors. Just as Leah was thinking hard about solidarity, I was thinking hard about democracy. There were so many claims within the movement that \u201cthis is what democracy looks like\u201d \u2013 from a chaotically run meeting to, I don\u2019t know, a drum circle. Astra, do your creative and organising worlds overlap much? AT: Rarely do they overlap in literal ways. Ages ago I roped my partner [the singer-songwriter Jeff Mangum] into playing music at Occupy, and also at the launch of the Rolling Jubilee, but we haven\u2019t done anything like that since. That said, my more artistic projects \u2013 as a film-maker, or playing music with Neutral Milk Hotel [with Mangum] \u2013 don\u2019t feel totally separate from my political work. Organising is absolutely a creative act; it\u2019s about seeing the world as malleable and changeable, almost as a kind of material you can mould and remake. Political work can be very serious and hard but it is also an opportunity for collaboration and the unexpected, for experimentation and play. Organising, not unlike art-making, fundamentally involves taking an imaginative leap and also taking risks. Making films and being in a band involve coordinating a bunch of people and doing something together you couldn\u2019t do alone. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that a critical mass of the Debt Collective founders were artists. What\u2019s it like, Leah, being a member of the Hunt family but also being involved in social movements? LHH: The Hunt family [which owns one of the largest private oil companies in the US] is a fascinating one and my grandfather is a storied man, but my mom Helen left Dallas and raised me in NYC, in the feminist movement, surrounded by grassroots activists. She was focused on organising women of wealth to support women\u2019s rights, so in many ways I followed in her footsteps when I began to organise among wealthy donors too, though I was more focused on economic inequality. I also benefited from the example of my aunt, Swanee Hunt [former US ambassador to Austria], who spent her career helping women play leadership roles in politics, and particularly in conflict zones. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be who I am today without the influence of Helen and Swanee Hunt. Do you ever feel you have to play down your background, at least at first? LHH: I don\u2019t always lead with it, but it\u2019s important to be honest so that people don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve hidden something from them. There can be a tendency for people with wealth who have progressive politics to want to hide their background, or feel shame about it. I think it\u2019s important for each of us to embrace our own stories because in doing so, we can more readily access the diverse resources that our backgrounds give us access to. And as you say in the book, solidarity is about diverse groups working together. AT: We\u2019re pushed into identity camps \u2013 that\u2019s the political terrain that we\u2019re operating on. There has been a long and very well-funded effort to sabotage solidarity using divide-and-conquer tactics. In the US, the recent indictment of 61 activists at \u201cCop City\u201d [a \u00a370m police training facility being built on one of the only green spaces in Atlanta] names solidarity as the dangerous ideology motivating these protesters. But solidarity is not equivalent to identity \u2013 it transcends your identity, or expands it. We\u2019re saying that we need to push beyond the boundaries of the self. Solidarity is connecting across difference, building new alliances between people and then transforming the status quo. LHH: We were really interested in the history of the term, especially as it became more prominent in the late 1800s. At a time when we\u2019re so polarised, that feels like an important history to draw on. We didn\u2019t have a weekend, we didn\u2019t have an eight-hour workday: all these basic things that we take for granted now and are being eroded were the result of the labour movement\u2019s vision of a more humane society. They\u2019re the product of organising. AT: The modern discourse of solidarity emerged from the incredible tumult and economic change of the Industrial Revolution. Religious patterns were changing. There was a sense of the old systems that held things together crumbling, and that\u2019s when this question of solidarity came to the fore, with organised labour saying: \u201cWe want to challenge our exploitation. Solidarity can propel political changes.\u201d This is really relevant in this age of hyperpartisanship, where it\u2019s \u201cmy party versus your party\u201d. We\u2019re asking again: what can hold us together in this time of incredible tumult? Writing this book, I was struck by how we\u2019re having a lot of the same debates right now. LHH: We propose a vision of the \u201csolidarity state\u201d, like how the welfare state was what came out of those 18th- and 19th-century conversations \u2013 what\u2019s the 21st-century version of this? We\u2019re thinking of it not as just an interpersonal phenomenon, but as something that can be built into the fabric of society. What if people feel too scared, apathetic or exhausted to get involved? LHH: That feeling of powerlessness is a huge factor in the crisis that we\u2019re in. When I went to one of Astra\u2019s Debt Collective Rolling Jubilee events, everyone came wearing a name tag with how much debt they were in, and the idea was to say: this is not something that you need to be ashamed of; it\u2019s not a personal moral failing. This is a systemic problem and we can change this if we work together. Organising is the best kind of antidepressant if you\u2019re feeling alone or isolated or powerless. Get involved in an organisation because it can feel so powerful. AT: When people talk about the problems of social media and misinformation, especially among liberals, there\u2019s a sense that what we need to do is fact check our way out of this. Our argument is that we need to organise people out of this. That\u2019s what labour unions do at their best \u2013 they\u2019re not just forums for demanding better treatment but, like Occupy was for us, they\u2019re places of political education. We say: your enemies are not immigrants or trans people or students. Your enemies are the folks who are benefiting from and perpetuating this system. I\u2019m a big fan of [the organiser and educator] Mariame Kaba and her wonderful phrase, \u201chope is a discipline\u201d. We\u2019re looking back at this history \u2013 from abolitionists to disability justice movements and workers \u2013 and seeing that people fought against incredible odds in conditions where they had no reason to be optimistic. Only by working together can we save ourselves and each other. \u2022 Solidarity: The Past, Present, and Future of a World-Changing Idea by Astra Taylor and Leah Hunt-Hendrix is published by Pantheon (\u00a324.25)",

        "body": "On its surface, Only God Was Above Us, the fifth album from Vampire Weekend, has a darkly fatalist point of view. Over some of the band\u2019s loudest, grittiest production to date, frontman and songwriter Ezra Koenig sings of curses, missed connections and imagined wars, airing plangent anxieties about how this tumultuous era of history will be remembered. It plays a little like a knottier sequel to the band\u2019s anxious 2013 record Modern Vampires of the City \u2013 but Koenig himself hopes the album leaves listeners with some level of hope. \u201cI think fatalism taken to its extreme is optimism \u2013 some of the happiest people in the world have some element of surrender and acceptance,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s fatalism \u2013 the world is a chaotic place and isn\u2019t that terrible? And then there\u2019s optimism \u2013 the world is a chaotic place, and you gotta surf that wave.\u201d The line of thinking is typical Koenig: carefully equivocal and wryly flippant at the same time, delivered earnestly and thoughtfully. It\u2019s a tightrope walk that\u2019s spilled into Only God Was Above Us, which dips back into the genteel trappings of early Vampire Weekend records \u2013 richly orchestrated with lush, ambling upright bass, dizzying sax solos and cascading piano lines \u2013 but manages to sound vastly different to anything the band have done before. There\u2019s a tense, almost violent streak to this album. Koenig agrees that it is \u201caesthetically darker \u2013 tonally, it\u2019s the most aggressive record we\u2019ve made\u201d, but he doesn\u2019t necessarily see it as a heavier record than its predecessor, 2019\u2019s shaggy, maximalist Father of the Bride. \u201cI think if you swapped the album covers, people would hear them differently,\u201d he says. \u201cBut maybe you have to allow people to categorise the albums by some kind of binary.\u201d Koenig and I are meeting in February, a few days before the long-awaited new album is announced. Sitting in a central London photo studio, he looks barely any different from when he was promoting Father of the Bride. His style, though, has changed with his records\u2019 shifts in tone, ditching brightly coloured fleeces with socks and sandals in favour of a khaki sweater and sand-toned slacks \u2013 perhaps a byproduct of his imminent 40th birthday. Ageing certainly influenced the restless, if hopeful, spirit of Only God Was Above Us. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was maybe a little arrogant, waiting for life to show me what was so good about it \u2013 and then I was like: \u2018Oh right, every person has an ability to love life,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the type of idea that would make my eyes roll out of my head when I was a sullen teenager or in my late 20s, wrestling with the point of all this.\u201d It\u2019s a marked change from his band\u2019s early years, when they were praised for distilling big ideas about existence and mortality into catchy, richly produced pop songs. Emerging in the mid-00s as part of a wave of indie bands that included MGMT and Animal Collective, Vampire Weekend quickly ascended to festival headliner status, thanks in no small part to their prodigious songwriting ability and Koenig\u2019s own sense of ambition. \u201cWhen the band was starting, I was obsessed with getting [second album] Contra out in 2010 \u2013 I thought it was important that we released albums back to back \u2013 it was so rushed. There was a real feeling of: \u2018This is a rare opportunity,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cTo continue at that pace and with that level of agitation would send anybody to burnout. And then you get into these existential things: if all you\u2019re doing is making music, what\u2019s the music about?\u201d In the five years since Father of the Bride, Koenig let life take centre stage. In 2018, he and his wife, the actor Rashida Jones, had a baby; after touring the album, he spent time living in Tokyo and London, in addition to their home base of Los Angeles, while she worked on film projects, grateful to let his life contract a little after the circus of promoting a record. He wrote and recorded parts of Only God Was Above Us in those cities, but it was hardly a case of choosing flashy recording destinations. \u201cLiving in these different places superficially gives the record a glamorous touch, but when you\u2019re moving abroad with your family, and your wife is working 14 hours a day, and your kid is in school, there\u2019s also a lot of solitude,\u201d he says. The relative mundanity of this time, he says, \u201callowed ideas to just creep in\u201d with little external pressure. \u201cI like doing normal stuff \u2013 I like taking long walks and being alone and reading. I like taking my son to school in the morning and talking about what we see during the drive. I like that being my primary mode.\u201d Only God Was Above Us is the first record Koenig has written since having a child. Has fatherhood changed his outlook on songwriting, or his career? \u201cThe short answer is no,\u201d he says, smiling sheepishly. The album\u2019s sense of optimism, however, does derive in part from some sense of responsibility he feels towards a younger generation. \u201cThe future is totally out of their control,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you hear people talk about whatever aspect of the world is their current fixation \u2013 like: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this exists when my child is gonna be growing up\u2019 \u2013 and then you realise, well, what can you give a child other than a way of embracing life?\u201d Such an idea is a necessity in the US right now, when partisan politics are at their most fractious. Koenig was a staunch Bernie Sanders supporter during both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns, and played at a handful of the senator\u2019s rallies. By the time 2020 rolled around, \u201cit felt a little bit like, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t know how likely it is that this is gonna happen, but it feels like the right thing to do at this moment,\u2019\u201d he recalls. Does he think any of Sanders\u2019s trademark policies, such as universal healthcare, might be revived during this year\u2019s election cycle? \u201cThere\u2019s always hope, because I think a lot of that stuff would be great. Rationally, are any of those things around the corner? I just don\u2019t know.\u201d The calmness with which he speaks about politics is reflected on Hope, the album\u2019s final track, on which he runs through a laundry list of political conspiracies and defeats, before landing on a note of bittersweet acceptance: \u201cOur enemy\u2019s invincible / I hope you let it go.\u201d He sees this, too, as a moment of optimism. \u201cPolitics is obsessed with outcome, and we\u2019re all surrounded by the anger and frustration of people who deeply believe that things need to go one way or another,\u201d he says. Hope, the song, is an appeal to see hope as \u201ca personal feeling, rather than a demand on the outside world\u201d, an idea he\u2019s come to as he\u2019s grown older. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be millions of people disappointed at any given moment, maybe billions globally. If you hope for something specific, you will often be disappointed, but hope as a feeling, or a concept, [is] somehow bigger than outcome.\u201d In the same way that Only God Was Above Us returns to the baroque, distorted sound they explored on Modern Vampires, it also sees Koenig reuniting with his bandmates Chris Baio and Chris Tomson, who toured with the band circa Father of the Bride but didn\u2019t play on the record, and were not pictured in press photos. Multi-instrumentalist Rostam Batmanglij, who left the band after Modern Vampires, also worked on the new album\u2019s production, as he did on Father of the Bride, although he is still not \u201cin\u201d the band. Koenig says there wasn\u2019t a conscious decision to bring Tomson and Baio back into the fold; Vampire Weekend has long been a recording project, and Father of the Bride was made with \u201cthem having some confidence in me to take us somewhere interesting, and me having confidence that they\u2019d be down to kind of wait and still be a part of it.\u201d A few years down the line, Koenig says he doesn\u2019t know if presenting Father of the Bride as a solo project was a good idea or not, although ultimately \u201cthe record was a success, we were very happy with the reception, it was our best and biggest tour\u201d. He still feels his motivations for the decision were sound. \u201cI just had a feeling that going into the fourth album, seeing a picture of three guys in their mid-30s was kind of like: \u2018This is gonna look like damaged goods.\u2019\u201d Part of it may have been that he was still \u201ctraumatised by the haters of our early days\u201d, he admits, referring to the coterie of music critics who ripped into the band for their perceived white, upper-class perspective \u2013 despite the fact that Koenig and Batmanglij, the band\u2019s songwriters, were working-class Jewish and Iranian, respectively. Presenting Father of the Bride as a solo project came out of a protective instinct. \u201cI had a feeling that it was going to be the most difficult transition, because some type of indie era was over, we lost a member, and our last album was our most serious, critically acclaimed album ever. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d Koenig is right in thinking that the scene Vampire Weekend came out of no longer exists in the same way; major mechanisms for breaking a band, such as indie blogs, no longer exist, and few rock artists are making it to the top of the Billboard charts. On a personal level, he no longer feels tapped into modern indie music, and says that anyway the press no longer seems intent on asking older bands to provide a seal of approval for rising prospects \u2013 as when Vanity Fair asked Paul Simon for his opinion on them back in 2011. \u201cI don\u2019t know who the [young] Vampire Weekend is now, and I don\u2019t know if anybody knows,\u201d Koenig says. \u201cWhen Contra came out, I knew the context it was made in; when this album comes out, I only know it in terms of Vampire Weekend\u2019s career.\u201d That seems to be as liberating for Koenig as it is unnerving; in Only God Was Above Us it results in a sound that\u2019s richer and more expansive than anything the band have made before, even as it returns to a style they mined deeply on Modern Vampires. \u201cThat context is another thing to contend with,\u201d he says. \u201cBut ultimately, I surrender to Father Time.\u201d Only God Was Above Us is released 5 April.",

        "body": "If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it? Peanut butter, banana and honey and a little bit of cinnamon. That is a pretty dessert-like sandwich but literally, before we started speaking, I ate one. Often when I\u2019m working or traveling, I\u2019ll eat at least one peanut butter sandwich a day. It is good protein! Do you have a favourite guitar? I have a walnut brown 1972 Gibson SG that I bought in Tacoma, Washington around 2000. Before that I\u2019d only ever played an Epiphone copy of an SG, and then moved on to Rickenbackers, but I wanted an actual Gibson SG from the 1970s. This is a little bit nerdy, but there\u2019s this dubious era of Gibson called the Norlin era, where supposedly the guitars made during this era were less consistent and reliable sonically than previous or later eras. Mine happens to be a Norlin but it has a great sound. I like that it has a thin neck as I don\u2019t have giant hands. I love it. It\u2019s the guitar I return to. I recorded a lot of Little Rope on it. What\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever received? Wait things out. There can be things that you really worry about in the moment that feel dire and irreversible \u2013 then you wait six months and it just doesn\u2019t matter any more. You get swept up in a moment of anger, jealousy or disorientation but if you stick things out long enough, it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve previously called Australia the spiritual home of Sleater-Kinney. What is the most Australian thing you\u2019ve ever done? Probably date an Australian? That sounds crude \u2013 it sounds like I\u2019m saying I literally did an Australian, which I guess I did. But I\u2019m very much immersed in Aussie culture. What has been your biggest fashion crime to date? I am guilty of what I call \u201ca tour outfit\u201d. I go somewhere like Mexico or Marfa, Texas and I\u2019ll think, \u201cOh, this giant cowboy hat looks great on me!\u201d And I will wear it throughout the entire trip. In every photo, I am wearing this accoutrement. And then I get home and I am horrified. It\u2019s almost like a horror movie, where I go into my closet and I see this hat and it\u2019s like some stranger has put it there. What is this god-awful item of clothing? Suddenly it looks terrible, it looks farcical and inauthentic. And then I have to get rid of it. So big hats are my most recurring fashion crime. What do you do when you can\u2019t get to sleep? I listen to podcasts or audiobooks, but it has to be a mellifluous, comforting voice. I really like Jon Ronson. He has a great voice. I find it very soothing. There\u2019s no hard edges to it. It is sort of reedy, almost pretty. Do you believe in extraterrestrial life? I want to. I think it\u2019s fairly solipsistic to assume that humans are the only species that are able to build a society. Maybe in some far off part of the galaxy, there\u2019s some other species doing what we\u2019re doing. For all I know, we\u2019re living in a simulation of something that they have created \u2026 It almost would feel reassuring about not being the only thing out there. Do you have a party trick? I can juggle for a respectable amount of time \u2013 enough for somebody to be temporarily impressed. But it has to be a spherical item. I am not juggling knives or fire. Which movie scarred you as a kid? The Shining. I saw it a little too young. It\u2019s so scary. When I was a kid, I was watching horror movies like Nightmare on Elm Street \u2013 films that were more fantastical and unbelievable. And then I saw The Shining and I just thought \u201cNo, there is true horror out there.\u201d And it comes from isolation and having a writing deadline. When was the last time you lied? I often cancel plans with an excuse that may not be factual. It\u2019s never to hang out with someone else \u2013 I just don\u2019t want to go out. It\u2019s actually something that I want to be more honest about because every time I do it, I think, \u201cWhy not just say that I really need some alone time tonight?\u201d But for some reason I always come up with some alternate fact like, I have a sore throat or I had to work late. I should just say \u2013 I think in this day and age, everyone understands.\ufeff Sleater-Kinney is touring Australia and New Zealand in May: Auckland on 15 May, Brisbane on 17 May, Melbourne on 19 May, Sydney on 21 May and Fremantle on 23 May.",

        "body": "Lately when I visit my mother, she\u2019s always out. \u201cAt rehearsal!\u201d she\u2019ll text. \u201cCome back after 5pm. Or another day.\u201d She\u2019s fallen in with a community choir, and is off the rails. Often they take her to the pub, and she doesn\u2019t know when she\u2019ll be back. Sometimes she leaves out a plate of falafel, in case I drop by to empty the fridge, like a reverse Santa Claus. But it\u2019s unacceptable. And often dry. At 80, she\u2019s started going to Laban dance classes. She still plays in a drum circle, and now this, singing in an urban opera. For her, art is a reflex. She does things for their own joy, while still holding down a job. I\u2019m the opposite. I made writing and performing my job; yet something in a creative identity can squash itself. Without the stamp of an agent, an audience, a platform or a deal, nothing I make would feel valid. I never wrote a word until I was paid, and I dream of retirement. She\u2019s more avant garde than me, in every way. I remember happier days, when she\u2019d meet me at the door with something hot from the kitchen. \u201cSpinach soldiers on speedboats\u201d for example: vegetable croquettes standing to attention on half a baguette, with omelette netting. She\u2019d make daal with chewy mango from snack packs. She had been working on a perfectly spherical meal. It involved stuffing a portobello mushroom with lingonberries, placing it within a bisected English muffin, and re-sealing it. She was this close to creating a Euclidean turducken, but moved on. Where she expands, I contract. When my life as an actor entered a fallow period, I worried about being demoted to a hobbyist. What makes a real actor? Is it a measure of how often they get to do it, how good they are, whether they\u2019re being paid? Is going to drama school like having tenure, a lifetime ratification? Actors are insecure, because they need permission to practise their art. It\u2019s not so much a profession as an existential crisis in tights. Determined to kidnap my mother, as well as find out what an urban opera actually is, I turned up to one of her performances. Our Street, it\u2019s called, devised by the Lewisham Creative Chorus \u2013 a group more diverse in terms of age, ethnicity and background than any West End production could dream of. These things make a difference. \u201cSalus populi suprema lex esto\u201d began the show \u2013 an unsettling whisper from performers placed in the crowd. The wellbeing of the people is the highest law. Whispers became a chant, then morphed into one of the catchiest, most rousing songs I\u2019ve ever heard. There were heart-stopping soloists, puppetry, poetry, snatches of Schubert. When my mother appeared centre stage, cradling a mannequin of a boy, clearly deeply moved, I burst into tears. I\u2019d expected this to be sweet, but I hadn\u2019t expected it to actually be good. I\u2019d envisioned amateur dramatics. Visions of retirees stumbling through The Importance of Being Earnest in a town hall, making nonsense of the lines amid a collapsing set. Where does that snobbery about amateur dramatics come from? If you are a creative and a child of Thatcher, you hang on to hierarchies that no one else cares about. It\u2019s the only way to shore up a precarious self-image, with a cripplingly internalised worldview that says art is worthless unless it has economic value. But we\u2019re past that now. The sinking financial tide of these past decades has exposed the supporting beams involved in becoming a professional creative. Does anyone look at these \u201cThirty Under 30\u201d lists, without realising most of them, without denying the obvious talent, could be re-titled \u201cHow Deep Is Your Safety Net\u201d? Most popular culture, especially for the young, is generated by what we once called amateurs. TikTok comedians, whose skits go viral. Soundcloud rappers and musicians who find critical acclaim. Bedroom-based makeup tutorials posted on YouTube shape how we look. Recipes from home chefs become staples, we buy art from artists who never went to art school, follow singers whose only qualification is being really good at singing. Social media may be bad for our health, but it is good at bypassing gatekeepers. We need this bursting dam of talent more than ever. The rise of amateur orchestras, community choirs and dance groups arguably doesn\u2019t need to be celebrated. It is the celebration. I do think there\u2019s something different happening than with TV shows like Britain\u2019s Got Talent or The X Factor, where the big prize is still, ultimately, fame. There\u2019s something about performers who do it for connection and community that breaks me open with joy. They put real life on the stage, more viscerally than professionals can. But art is not a competition, any more than it is a distraction, or a luxury for a privileged few. It\u2019s our humanity, and it\u2019s how we keep going. It\u2019s why we keep going. Inspired, I resolve to unstitch my paralysis. My renaissance mother is not an artist because she trained, or gets gigs. She decided she is one, and lives accordingly. So I sit and write a short scene, for no one other than myself. It feels good. It feels alive. I guess I am my mother\u2019s child after all. And now I\u2019m hungry. Lewisham Creative Chorus are raising money to put on a full version of their urban opera. You can support them here. (I\u2019d be grateful, as I\u2019m hoping my mother moves on from this and gets back to my dinners. For Mother\u2019s Day she gave me pigs in blankets.) Follow Rhik on X @whatsamadder",

After zero perfect matches in drawings over the weekend, the estimated jackpot of the Powerball is now at $800m, while that of the Mega Millions is at $1.1bn. In a statement released on Sunday, Powerball said that its current jackpot was \u201cquickly climbing the rankings as one of the game\u2019s largest\u201d. With the $800m scheduled for Monday evening, the jackpot has been marked as the sixth-largest prize in the game\u2019s history. The jackpot\u2019s cash value is at an estimated $384.8m. Powerball officials said Sunday\u2019s prize was the second advertised jackpot to reach $800m this year. On 1 January, a ticket in Michigan won the previous Powerball jackpot, which was worth $842.4m. Since then, there have been 35 consecutive drawings without a single winner, Powerball said. With Powerball tickets sold at $2 per play in 45 states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, the odds of winning the game\u2019s jackpot are 1 in 292.9m. Mega Millions issued a similar statement, saying on Saturday that \u201cfor the sixth time in less than six years\u201d, the jackpot has topped $1bn. The next drawing is set for Tuesday. The jackpot\u2019s cash value is approximately $525.8m. If the jackpot is won on Tuesday, it would be the fifth largest prize in the history of the game, Mega Millions said. The last Mega Millions jackpot was won by two tickets on 8 December and was worth $394m. \u201cLottery fever continues to spread throughout the country,\u201d Gretchen Corbin of the Mega Millions Consortium said. Corbin added: \u201cLarge jackpots provide entertainment and winnings for our players nationwide, while contributing to the beneficiary programs funded by each lottery. We appreciate our players and dedicated retailers, and we encourage everyone to play responsibly.\u201d Like the Powerball, Mega Millions tickets are also sold for $2 each in 45 states, Washington DC and the US Virgin Islands. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are 1 in 302.6m.",

        "body": "The vast majority of England\u2019s biggest subsidised cultural institutions are now operating at a loss, including many internationally renowned venues and arts brands. Financial data gathered for a new national lobbying group called Culture Makes \u2026, started by the Cultural Philanthropy Foundation (CPF), revealed the severe plight of even theatres, galleries and museums that receive regular state grants. The success of these national gems is usually considered a matter of pride. But end-of-year accounts recently submitted by the 100 organisations that get the most annual funding from Arts Council England show 73 have reported a loss, and this averages at about \u00a3300,000. Among them is the Royal Shakespeare Company, which has dipped into the red by a few thousand pounds, despite some stringent budgeting. While not all of these leading venues and cultural attractions are actually in debt, several are. And even though commercial profitability is not always the bottom line \u2013 since levels of subsidy will always be required \u2013 many have fallen well short of attempts to break even. \u201cIt was very striking how hard it is for even these top institutions, known as the arts council\u2019s National Portfolio organisations, especially as they are already pulling all the available financial levers,\u201d said Caroline McCormick, who chairs the CPF and is organiser of the lobbying drive, which will launch in May with the aim of influencing policy before the next general election. \u201cIt is now all so close to the bone.\u201d McCormick plans to call for protection for British culture by demonstrating its importance, opposing the notion that it is an optional extra, and something to aim for only in better days. \u201cThere is no trickle-down effect for the arts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe now know that is a myth. And there are not enough wealthy people making donations, so we cannot rely on arts philanthropy.\u201d The campaign has already won the support of almost 40 cultural bodies and providers, including the RSC, Edinburgh international festival, Bristol Old Vic, the Women\u2019s Prize Trust, Hastings Contemporary, Theatre Clwyd, Lyric Theatre Belfast, Northern Ballet, Southbank Centre, Picturehouse Cinemas, Talawa Theatre Company, National Museums Liverpool and Shakespeare\u2019s Globe. \u201cThe arts and culture have immense power to transform the lives of all who encounter it,\u201d the RSC\u2019s joint interim executive directors, Sandeep Mahal and Vicky Cheetham told the Observer, adding that at a time of economic uncertainty and funding cuts that were already challenging the wellbeing of people and communities around the country, their company is proud to be joining Culture Makes \u2026. \u201cThis campaign will help to build our collective understanding of the economic, creative, social and physical power that exists within the culture sector in the UK and support the case for growing critical public and private funds to ensure we have a thriving arts and culture sector that is a beacon to the world,\u201d they said. The wider arts crisis caused by the cost of living increase, in addition to a real-terms reduction of state funding and the complete loss of some local council grants, is already threatening the existence of smaller provincial organisations. But the effect on grander institutions has also become clear, in spite of what most acknowledge is the high value of a thriving British creative sector. Sydney Thornbury, chief executive of the contemporary gallery the Art House in Wakefield, said she signed up to the campaign because she had seen art create social benefits and build community. \u201cWe bring together asylum seekers, refugees and the local community to create art together, but this also creates relationships and community cohesion, and develops new skills and abilities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have re-animated nearly dead shopping centres, helped grow small creative businesses into renting their own shops, and helped to activate networks of local entrepreneurs \u2013 all while also helping to curb antisocial behaviour, raise local civic pride, and make some great art. But are we thriving financially? No. We\u2019re barely hanging on \u2013 like everyone else in the arts sector at the moment \u2013 because we are seen and funded as \u2018just\u2019 arts organisations.\u201d McCormick, who is also the director of Achates, an arts fundraising consultancy, pointed out that a report into charitable giving last year showed that arts philanthropy had declined to less than 1% of total donations for the first time in more than a decade. And the truth, she said, was that the poorest in society were giving proportionally much more than the rich. The new campaign frames culture as part of the crucial infrastructure of any successful country, let alone one that enjoys Britain\u2019s arts and entertainment track record. \u201cIt is not a question of the arts sitting at the top of the pile as something you get up to,\u201d McCormick added. \u201cIt\u2019s not an elite thing, even if some performers are elite. It actually works the other way round. It\u2019s the most basic thing that we need to build things upon. But the arts sector has to find a new language to communicate this. There is a very big job to do, and someone has to do it.\u201d",

        "body": "Simon Harris will become Ireland\u2019s youngest prime minister after the leadership race in his Fine Gael party ended without any other candidates coming forward. The leadership became vacant after the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, announced his surprise resignation \u201cfor personal and political reasons\u201d last week. Harris, 37, the higher education minister, was the only candidate when nominations closed at 1pm on Sunday, but he will not become taoiseach until 9 April when the Irish parliament, the D\u00e1il, resumes after its Easter break. He outlined his leadership priorities on Sunday at a selection convention in Athlone, County Westmeath, to choose party candidates for the European parliament elections in June. Harris said he wanted the centre-right Fine Gael \u2013 which governs with fellow conservatives Fianna F\u00e1il and the Green party \u2013 to revert to core values including making work pay, being tough on law and order and supporting farmers. \u201cFine Gael stands for supporting businesses, especially small businesses the length and breadth of this country. Fine Gael stands for making work pay, for making sure we value work and we value people who go to work.\u201d To cheers from the audience he added: \u201cFine Gael stands for law and order.\u201d He also told delegates \u201cit was the absolute honour of my life\u201d to be elected leader. He concluded, to a standing ovation, with: \u201cI\u2019m up for it. Are you?\u201d Heather Humphreys, the social protection minister, who is from a rural border constituency, is expected to be named as deputy leader of the party. Harris has given no indication as to possible changes in Fine Gael ministerial ranks. But there is speculation that ministers who do not intend to stand at the next election will be dropped. It is widely believed that Simon Coveney will be a casualty in the reshuffle. Varadkar resigned after taking responsibility for the government\u2019s failure in the recent referendums to update references to women and the family in the constitution. Harris is widely seen as a good communicator, particularly on social media. He has held a number of ministerial portfolios including health at the start of the Covid pandemic. Although widely praised for his handling of the crisis, he had to apologise for what he called an \u201cawful boo-boo\u201d after incorrectly saying in a radio interview there were 18 other coronaviruses before Covid-19. Until Varadkar\u2019s resignation it had been assumed that Ireland\u2019s next general election would be in October after a giveaway budget in September but the leaders of Fianna F\u00e1il and the Greens say they believe the government should see out the remaining 12 months of its term. Both Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il are trailing Sinn F\u00e9in, the leftwing nationalist party and Ireland\u2019s main opposition, in the polls but the political situation is very fluid. Sinn F\u00e9in, once the political wing of the IRA, is the largest party in the Northern Ireland assembly. A poll in the Sunday Business Post shows support for all three parties has fallen after the referendums, in which all three urged a yes vote to the proposed changes. The Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has demanded an immediate election but Harris is unlikely to grant her that. Instead he is expected to prioritise re-energising his party and focus on voters\u2019 key concerns, including housing.",

        "body": "Nuclear energy ranks last on the list of climate technologies that big institutional investors want exposure to, according to a survey of climate conscious investors with $37tn under management. Fewer than one in 10 investors were exploring new investments in nuclear technology in the survey of the Investor Group on Climate Change, whose 100 members include super funds and asset managers looking after the funds of 15 million Australians. The survey found a rebound in confidence in Australia\u2019s climate policy but a growing appetite for clear timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The opposition, led by Peter Dutton, plans to propose locating nuclear power plants on the site of retiring coal power plants, claiming that this would save having to build new transmission infrastructure for renewables. But the plan has been widely panned. The energy department has estimated it would cost $387bn to go nuclear, and Dutton faces opposition from his own state colleagues. Australia\u2019s big private electricity generators have dismissed nuclear energy as a viable source of power for their customers for at least another decade, and likely more. In the yearly survey by the Investor Group on Climate Change investors were asked which energy and climate solutions they believed had good long-term returns. Nuclear energy was ranked last of 14 possible responses, along with sustainable oceans. \u201cThis is due to nuclear energy\u2019s very high cost, and the lack of maturity and deployment in next generation technologies,\u201d a policy brief on the survey said, citing the CSIRO\u2019s gencost report. The five most popular options were: renewable energy (backed by 47% of respondents); nature solutions, including biodiversity or nature capital (34%); energy storage (32%); low carbon transport (32%); and industry/materials, including critical minerals (32%). In 2021 about 70% of investors cited policy and regulatory uncertainty as a barrier to investing in climate solutions, a figure that dropped to 40% in the 2023 data released on Monday. Asked to nominate the policies they wanted the government to prioritise, most investors (56%) called for sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans to keep global heating under the 1.5C threshold. There was also majority support for improved carbon pricing through the safeguard mechanism (54%), funding support for new technology (53%), and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies (51%). The policy brief said \u201cemerging priorities\u201d included mandatory climate-related disclosures, timelines for the phase-out of coal, oil and gas, and clear policies to build resilience and adapt to the physical damages of climate change. Erwin Jackson, Investor Group on Climate Change\u2019s managing director of policy, said: \u201cInvestors have given the government a pretty good report card. \u201cThey\u2019re also sending the message that credible, investible and durable policy frameworks put in place today will support strong investor and beneficiary returns into the future, enhance Australia\u2019s economic competitiveness, and help attract international capital. \u201cWe must have a fair and fast transition to net zero emissions, but we must also adapt. \u201cInvestors look forward to working with governments on initiatives that can incentivise and remove barriers for private sector investment in adaptation across the economy.\u201d In the 2023 budget the Albanese government gave $2bn to help establish Australia\u2019s hydrogen industry and a further $1bn for households. In February Anthony Albanese raised expectations of another major energy package in this year\u2019s budget, telling the Hunter Nexus dinner that Australia \u201cmust be prepared to think big\u201d to help regions diversify their economies and achieve the energy transition. Albanese said that \u201cevery nation needs to decarbonise and electrify\u201d and this was \u201ca race that Australia can win\u201d. \u201cNo nation is better placed than Australia to achieve this transition here at home \u2013 and power it in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a task that traverses far more than energy policy, or industry policy. \u201cThis is a whole-of-nation opportunity and it demands a whole-of-economy approach.\u201d",

        "body": "A few years ago when I was in the midst of moving into a new apartment, I cut my finger while slicing a tomato. It was so bad I thought I needed stitches and I didn\u2019t have a first-aid kit easily accessible, so I called my youngest brother, who was working as a junior doctor at a nearby hospital. He came over with what he called the Rolls-Royce of Band-Aids, applied one carefully to my finger and asked me if I\u2019d help him choose a skirt to wear to a party that night. Helping him pick outfits is one of my favourite activities. At his request, I put on Dua Lipa (the party was in her honour) while he modelled the different options with a twirl and a hip pop. We picked one, decided on shoes and that he\u2019d wear his shirt tucked in. As he went to leave I had to catch myself from asking if he was going to put trousers on for the bike ride to the party. He is six years younger than me, but in that moment I was surprised at my own instinct for conservatism and grateful that in the years between us, gender norms have softened so much that he could leave the house in a skirt without thinking twice. Of course, it helps that he\u2019s handsome and he was riding his bike across Melbourne\u2019s inner north, but the experience \u2013 from his expertise as a \u201cgrown-up\u201d medical professional to his assuredness in his own feminine-masculinity \u2013 left me full of pride at the person he is. And thankful that (in some ways) we live in an increasingly open-minded society. Here, four men describe their adventures in skirts. \u2018I\u2019ve learned to impress myself the most\u2019 Louis Nuccitelli\u2019s experiments with skirts have come about in the last year. The designer and retail partnerships lead for Uber first wore a skirt when he dressed up as a Playboy bunny for a friend\u2019s birthday in January. More recently, he wore a red tartan miniskirt with a silver buckle clasp for his 30th birthday. The party theme was Louis\u2019 House Of Versailles. \u201cPicture the creative alchemy of a love child between Vivienne Westwood and Rick Owens as you enter,\u201d he says. Nuccitelli, who played at being a fashion designer when he was as young as eight, channelled the theme into his outfit with precise attention to detail. He styled the skirt with a structured white corset that sat just below his chest. He wore a heart-buckled belt around his waist and a bolero-style gold and black striped shirt with a ruffled collar. The look was finished with tall, bowed socks and a pair of black leather boots. \u201cI felt hot as fuck,\u201d he says. \u201cI went through some ghastly years of dressing to impress other people. In navigating this sphere, I\u2019ve learned to impress myself the most with the way I dress.\u201d \u2018I used to skateboard in them\u2019 The first time the director of Oig\u00e5ll Projects, Andy Kelly, wore a skirt in public it was a kilt and he was a partner at a debutante ball. \u201cIt was for the New Caledonian Society,\u201d he says. \u201cHow waspy is that?\u201d A few years later, at the age of 17, he started wearing \u201cugly chic\u201d floral skirts he found at op-shops in Sydney\u2019s Paddington. \u201cI used to skateboard in them and think I was a revolution,\u201d he says. He would team the knee-length, pleated or ruffled skirts with Harley-Davidson T-shirts or checked shirts and a fedora. Kelly, who is also the designer for Brud Studia and more than 180cm tall, doesn\u2019t shy away from attention. \u201cI think being a gay man, there is a lot of pressure to be hyper-masculine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was actually more subversive in that community to be a big guy who is quite masculine wearing garments like skirts.\u201d Over time, as his taste evolved, he started reaching for more expensive skirts by designers such as Givenchy and Kenzo. \u201cI haven\u2019t grown out of it. I am in a very pleated Thom Browne preppy skirt era currently,\u201d he says. \u201cWear a skirt, be your own hero.\u201d \u2018They relished dressing me\u2019 \u201cI grew up in a household that encouraged and loved all sides of us,\u201d says Liam Sharma. \u201cWearing a dress only felt weird once I started registering constructs in my first years of school.\u201d Sharma, a writer who also works for a beauty brand, loved to wear his sisters\u2019 hand-me-down pastel satin floor-length skirts. He\u2019d style them with a matching handbag (also designed by his sister) and prance around in the outfit before bed. \u201cI was a wobbly kid and stubbed my toes too much,\u201d he says. \u201cI left dried blood on a lot of floor-length gowns \u2026 I thought it was a mark of love and my sisters thought it was disgusting. But they relished dressing me.\u201d For Sharma, wearing a skirt represents a kind of freedom. \u201cNo one placed too much emphasis on what I could or couldn\u2019t wear. I was left alone to play in fabric and pull and pick pieces I thought I might love.\u201d \u2018After a glass of wine (or two) I was elated\u2019 Hamish was going out to lunch with a friend for her birthday when he wore his first skirt. \u201cIt was a three-quarter-length black Yohji Yamamoto skirt made from soft canvas,\u201d he says. \u201cThe silhouette was relaxed with some extra material, which created soft folds so it tapered.\u201d He found the confidence to wear it from some new friendships that had a playful, sisterly dynamic. \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t know me well, I had an opportunity to emphasise different parts of my personality,\u201d he says. \u201cI could talk and act in ways that might have been unlike my usual conduct, so I felt like I could wear different things without the risk being balked at by my usual group of friends. \u201c[I was] a touch insecure when leaving the house but after a glass of wine (or two) I was elated.\u201d Hamish styled the skirt with a white lightweight long shirt over a singlet. \u201cIt was typically a shirt I wore to the beach, so it was soft from all the washes and the colour had faded into a shade of sun lotion,\u201d he says. \u201cThe length of the shirt made it less obvious I was wearing a skirt, but they combined into a very comforting and summery flowing outfit.\u201d",

        "body": "When the former president Donald Trump appointed the Texas attorney James Ho to the fifth circuit court of appeals in 2017, lawyers at the prominent law firm Gibson Dunn \u2013 where Ho worked before his appointment \u2013 had a problem: how to replace the politically connected Ho. Turns out, they didn\u2019t even need to change the home address for his replacement. Ho\u2019s wife, Allyson, moved into her husband\u2019s position and his old office. Meet the Hos. Few people outside of legal circles have heard of the Hos, yet the couple is tied to the case before the US supreme court that will determine women\u2019s access to mifepristone, a drug commonly used in medication abortions. The court hears arguments in the case on Tuesday. Ho served on the three-judge panel last summer that ruled to restrict access to mifepristone. The legal group behind the mifepristone case, Alliance Defending Freedom, made at least six payments from 2018 through 2022 to his wife, Allyson, a powerhouse federal appellate lawyer who has argued in front of the supreme court and has deep connections to the conservative legal movement that has led the attack on the right to abortion in the US. The payments don\u2019t violate the court\u2019s code of conduct, according to Stephen Gillers, a New York University emeritus professor of law and author of Regulation of Lawyers: Problems of Law and Ethics. But some court watchers argue that Ho\u2019s failure to recuse himself from the case illustrates why public trust in the judiciary is eroding. One recent survey found that 63% of judges noted a dip in the public\u2019s positive perception of them. \u201cWhen Americans see a case like this \u2013 so clearly concocted and motivated by special interests, and with evident connections between those interests and the judges on the case, it does tremendous damage to the reputation of the courts, and to the public trust in their ability to give all litigants an even shake,\u201d said Alex Aronson, the executive director of the non-partisan group Court Accountability and a former chief counsel to the Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse. In an email to the Guardian, James Ho wrote that he \u201cconsulted our court\u2019s ethics advisor prior to sitting in that case, and was advised that there was no basis for recusal. In any event, my wife\u2019s practice is to donate honoraria to charity.\u201d The Hos are just one of the increasing number of power couples in the conservative movement in which the wife of a prominent official works in the background, laying the groundwork for Republican policies that their spouses will rule upon or legislate. In the mifepristone case, the wife of the Missouri senator Josh Hawley, Erin, is the attorney of record for Alliance Defending Freedom and argued the case before Ho. The supreme court justice Clarence Thomas rankled the legal world when he refused to recuse himself from a case involving questions about the January 6 insurrection and the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d campaign to which his wife, Ginni Thomas, was closely tied. For Aronson, these are examples of \u201cserious concerns about what is becoming an apparent pattern of coordinated activity by some of these couples in this extremist movement, including the Thomases, Hawleys and Hos\u201d. Ho\u2019s rulings have included zealous language, referencing what he called in one decision \u201cthe moral tragedy of abortion\u201d. He has suggested that protection orders in domestic violence cases \u201care too often misused as a tactical device in divorce proceedings \u2013 and issued without any actual threat of danger\u201d. Orin Kerr, a University of California, Berkeley, law professor, tweeted that one of Ho\u2019s opinions \u201creads like a politician\u2019s op-ed, not a legal opinion; judges should stick to law\u201d. In the mifepristone case, in which Ho supported rolling back decisions made by the Food and Drug Administration to loosen restrictions on the drug, he wrote: \u201cUnborn babies are a source of profound joy for those who view them. Expectant parents eagerly share ultrasound photos with loved ones. Friends and family cheer at the sight of an unborn child. Doctors delight in working with their unborn patients \u2013 and experience an aesthetic injury when they are aborted.\u201d He has chafed legal traditionalists from the moment of his swearing-in, when he opted for the ceremony to be held in the private library of Harlan Crow \u2013 the conservative mega-donor who, ProPublica revealed, has lavished Clarence Thomas with trips on his yacht and paid the $6,000-a-month private school tuition for the justice\u2019s great-nephew. Ho worked as a clerk for Thomas in 2005. Ho vowed to boycott hiring Yale Law School graduates as clerks after students interrupted conservative speakers on campus, noting \u201ccancellations and disruptions seem to occur with special frequency\u201d at the Ivy League school. His caustic writings have drawn the spotlight while his wife, Allyson, has been working more inconspicuously, helping lay the legal foundation for conservative policies in her own work. She appears frequently as a speaker for the Federalist Society, the group that has led the conservative effort to reshape the judiciary. She has also worked pro bono for the Christian right organization First Liberty Institute, a group that describes its mission \u201cto defend and restore religious liberty in our schools, for our churches and houses of worship, inside the military, and throughout the public arena\u201d. It\u2019s unclear what Alliance Defending Freedom paid Allyson Ho to do, yet ending abortion is central among the organization\u2019s goals. The group helped write the Mississippi law that led to the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v Wade and ended the 50-year-old constitutional right to an abortion. Her husband\u2019s financial disclosures list descriptions of \u201cAcademy\u201d or \u201cFreedom Summit\u201d, next to some of the payments. The ADF hosts various legal trainings as part of its ADF Legal Academy that \u201cseamlessly combines outstanding legal training with an unwavering commitment to Christian principles\u201d and a Young Lawyers Academy. The Alliance Defending Freedom said: \u201cADF often invites lawyers of various backgrounds and experiences to speak at events. ADF offers honorariums for speaker participation. Allyson Ho is an exceptional lawyer with vast and diverse legal experience.\u201d A request to speak with Allyson Ho sent to Gibson Dunn has not been answered. The Texas senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, both Republicans, appointed Allyson to the state\u2019s committee responsible for recommending and vetting its recommendations to fill judicial vacancies. Neither Cruz nor Cornyn\u2019s offices responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for the names or dates of service for the judicial vetting committee nor did they respond to questions about what role, if any, Allyson had in her husband\u2019s nomination to the bench. In 2023, the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, hired Allyson and Gibson Dunn, at a rate of $1,313 per hour \u2013 with a $7m cap \u2013 to represent the state in a decade-long legal battle in which a federal judge determined Texas had failed to protect foster children. The state had previously been represented by attorneys on its own payroll. The move to hire Allyson and her firm signaled that Texas could be looking to fight back against court orders mandating Texas comply with federal monitors appointed to ensure the safety of vulnerable children in its care by appealing district court rulings to the fifth circuit court of appeals \u2013 the court on which James Ho serves. The mifepristone case might just be the beginning of the Hos\u2019 influence, Gillers, the NYU professor, said. \u201cIf Trump wins the election, you\u2019ll see Ho on the short list of nominees to the supreme court,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is obviously behaving in a way that makes him a very prominent candidate in a Republican administration.\u201d That appointment could once again leave an empty office \u2013 one that some might want Allyson to fill.",

        "body": "Becca Rothfeld is a dynamo. I had not come across her before picking up All Things Are Too Small and was unprepared for the book\u2019s extraordinary clout and reach. She is an American journalist (a contributor to the New Yorker and the New York Times and a critic on the Washington Post), a philosopher, polemicist and a wit. She challenges, in this bracing, original and intellectually poised collection of essays, many of our unquestioning modern assumptions and, most persuasively, takes aim at the promotion of minimalism as an ideal for our living spaces, novels and ourselves. Nothing, in Rothfeld\u2019s view, succeeds like excess and she packs so much into her opening essay about why it is OK to want more (the most extravagant of Oliver Twists) that you feel richly fed before even turning the first page. She includes the 13th-century Dutch mystic Hadewijch of Brabant (from whom her title is taken), Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick, the critic James Wood and even makes time to sympathise with a random man sighted in a restaurant who wolfed down three dishes of pasta in a row, commenting that he wouldn\u2019t have had to have third helpings \u201cif any plate available were big enough\u201d. Inevitably, Rothfeld, revelling in plurality, does not neglect to launch a scornful attack on an obvious target: tidying guru Marie Kondo. She claims to be nonplussed by Kondo\u2019s notorious method, which she describes as \u201ctouching items to determine whether they \u2018spark joy\u2019, then summarily tossing anything that induces more complex emotions, or, God forbid, thought\u201d. To be thought-free is something of which Rothfeld herself is incapable. She rails against blank-slateism. She notes that \u201cthe mechanism by which tossing old T-shirts is supposed to effect rebirth remains hazy\u201d. She broods about whether \u201cstuffing the local landfill is sufficient to effect widespread egalitarian overhaul\u201d. And there is \u2013 naturally \u2013 more. She convincingly laments the decluttering of contemporary literature, which she believes has produced many self-involved, overpruned and fragmented novels. She includes a respectful yet highly critical and underwhelmed essay on Sally Rooney and her \u201cpolitically anodyne\u201d work. I enjoy trying to declutter and recognise the value of mindfulness (a decluttering, with any luck, of the mind) but this did not spoil my delight at her refreshingly unconvinced essay on the subject. She describes her \u201cvirtuous boredom\u201d trying to meditate and absolute lack of interest in what her own breath is doing. Above all, she denounces the way that meditation, as she sees it, encourages a defeatist passivity. In a fiercely unequal world, she argues, trying to persuade people to accept unfair circumstances is unacceptable. Mindfulness \u201cfalsely assumes that our dissatisfaction is always attributable to mental mismanagement, never to circumstances of genuine injustice\u201d. Elsewhere, Rothfeld writes where devils fear to tread \u2013 about sex, beauty and desire and about consumption and consummation. There is a brilliant and startling essay, The Flesh, It Makes You Crazy, which includes a description of the lust she feels for her husband. I kept wondering how he might feel about this tribute (imagining him, sitting in armchair, hands over eyes). The obvious question she gives rise to is: can you have \u2013 or be \u2013 too much of a good thing? She writes scaldingly about \u201cnew puritan\u201d writers Christine Emba and Louise Perry, and emphasises that the erotic is \u201cits own wild creature, for which there is (and can be) no established idiom\u201d. She exposes the stifling conservatism of Emba and Perry and the tyranny to which their prudish conclusions lead. In the acknowledgments, Rothfeld thanks her editor for \u201ctrusting me to write at ecstatic length\u201d. And it is part of her scintillating achievement, in this book of appetite, to make one vow never again to use the phrase \u201cless is more\u201d under any circumstances. And yet, having said that, it is also the case \u2013 whisper it \u2013 that Rothfeld, who writes with such zest, could have got away with painlessly trimming one or two of these essays. And this is because, as a brilliant and decisive iconoclast, she also has the potential to be precisely what she would like to avoid: a compendious miniaturist. \u2022 All Things Are Too Small: Essays in Praise of Excess by Becca Rothfeld is published by Little, Brown (\u00a320).

        "body": "The first song I remember hearing My dad was a big fan of the Beatles. I remember sitting with great big earphones on listening to Here Comes the Sun. It\u2019s so melodic, cool and great. The song I inexplicably know every lyric to When I was about 16 or 17, we went on a rugby tour to France. For some reason we learned La Marseillaise \u2013 the national anthem of France \u2013 like a rugby tourist kind of thing. It\u2019s still stuck in my head. The best song to play at a party If you\u2019re my age, you\u2019ll remember that Jump Around by House of Pain is such a banger. Even if you\u2019re 18 or 19, the energy is still pretty good for a party. It\u2019s a cross-generational banger. The song I stream the most Romeo &amp; Julie by the Rifles, because it ends with a singalong, almost like a football anthem, so everybody joins in. If you\u2019ve seen them live, everybody knows it. The Rifles are one of my favourite bands, even though they\u2019ve never quite made it to the mainstream. The song I can no longer listen to Baby Shark. My little man\u2019s eight now, so I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to listen to it again. I\u2019m done with Baby Shark, thank you. The song I wish I\u2019d written Dry My Bones by this quirky Manchester indie band called the Slow Show. The lyrics are beautiful even though they are dealing with alcoholism and addiction. The song I secretly like but tell everyone I hate It\u2019s not very cool to like Simply Red, but Holding Back the Years is a top track. Mick Hucknall has got an incredible voice, an amazing energy. I know it\u2019s a bit hairdresser, in the background, but I actually quite like me some Simply Red. The song that changed my life Proof by I Am Kloot is probably the best track ever written. It was a record that was synonymous with me drinking. Music always connects to the soul and it\u2019s the most beautiful, wonderful, simple, amazing tune, but I\u2019m so pleased that part of my life isn\u2019t there any more. The song that gets me up in the morning Music is a huge part of kitchen life. Whoever comes in first puts on the radio or their own playlist because kitchens need energy. I\u2019ve never been in a kitchen that works in silence. There\u2019s no slow start. You don\u2019t gently wander into work and slowly build up to lunch. You have to drive it from the moment you get through the door. So, for me, anything by the Prodigy, but probably Firestarter. They\u2019re one of the best bands I\u2019ve ever seen live. The song I\u2019d like played at my funeral Pavarotti\u2019s Nessun Dorma. I\u2019m a big sports fan and Italia 90 was such a massive part of my life when I\u2019d just turned 17. That tune just builds and builds. I can imagine a massive coffin disappearing down while he\u2019s singing. What better way to go?

        "body": "Everyone knows \u2013 even if they haven\u2019t actually read them \u2013 about the fat novels of Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy. But The Russian Detective, a remarkable new graphic novel by Carol Adlam, takes its inspiration from more obscure sources. For some years, Adlam, an associate professor in the Nottingham School of Art and Design at Nottingham Trent University, and Claire Whitehead, a reader in modern languages at the University of St Andrew\u2019s, have been working together on the Lost Detective Project: a collaboration that draws on the work of long-forgotten writers of crime fiction who were contemporaries of Dostoevsky. As part of this project, Adlam has created several cross-media adaptations of their stories, of which The Russian Detective is one \u2013 and it could not be more rich or more beautiful if it tried. This is a book that repays multiple readings (and, for added pleasure, perhaps a little background reading). The fun starts with its endpapers: in the window of a fishmonger hang some huge red herrings. Take this as a warning. Adlam\u2019s book has tons of charm, not least its journalist-detective heroine, Charlotta Ivanovna, AKA Charlie Fox, a character she has described as a hybrid of Kate Warne, America\u2019s first female detective (Warne, who died in 1868, worked for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency), and the governess of the same name in Chekhov\u2019s play The Cherry Orchard (a gun-carrying eccentric who performs dramatic parlour tricks). But it\u2019s also a complicatedly plotted, intertextual visual feast: think I-Spy Russian Literature. I noted with a smile Dostoevsky\u2019s walk-on part as a grumpy rail passenger, and the seamstress whose clients include a Mrs Karenina. But I must admit that some of Adlam\u2019s other allusions \u2013 including a dream of Charlotta\u2019s that\u2019s taken from a passage in Alexander Pushkin\u2019s Eugene Onegin \u2013 passed me by at first. No matter. The book works on a more superficial level, too: a narrative that takes you back to the deep pleasures of childhood reading (I wonder if Adlam read Joan Aiken as a child, for it was Aiken as much as any Russian that I thought of as I turned its pages). It has an exciting \u2013 occasionally hard-to-follow \u2013 plot, in which Fox, a magician and a liar as well as newspaper reporter, grudgingly returns to her home town of Nowheregrad to investigate the murder of Elena Ruslanova, the daughter of a wealthy glass manufacturer. Here are footprints in blanketed snow, a little dog called Igoyok, a hot air balloon headed for Siberia, glamorous masked balls, Orthodox priests and a magic lantern theatre. But what really sets this exquisite book apart is its illustrations, so deeply atmospheric and so inordinately beautiful. Adlam is a deft caricaturist, an artist who can do a lot with a nose or a cheekbone. But this is as nothing to the way she incorporates different visual forms into her narrative, turning it, almost museum-like, into a luxuriant historical album. Woodcuts, newspaper cuttings, photogravure, even a thaumatrope: it feels like there\u2019s nothing she cannot do with her pen and her paintbrush \u2013 and if you fall for her talent as I have, and want to know more about the sources on which she has drawn so brilliantly, I recommend you look up a fascinating conversation from 2023 between her and Claire Whitehead in the academic journal Adaptation. \u2022 The Russian Detective by Carol Adlam is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a320).

I felt as if I had let down my parents, who wanted to retire off my winnings as an actor, except there were none. I took a long break from that and eventually got back into comedy at about 25 years old. What is your new tour, American Royalty, about? It\u2019s a fun show, it\u2019s silly and it touches on a lot of the topical current events and news issues that we\u2019ve all experienced over the last year. And not just American ones \u2013 I cover UK events, too. How would you describe your style of comedy? Dark and a bit silly. Does your comedy benefit from the state of politics at the moment? I hope it does. I think people need to laugh at the world and the world is crazier than ever. I think I put that through a filter that helps it make more sense. Any preshow rituals? I\u2019m not placating the British here but I like tea. I\u2019m not being patronising but I have a cup of Earl Grey before every show. It\u2019s in my rider and it\u2019s in all of my green rooms. I have a cup of tea and chill out. I like a bit of solitude before a show. Nothing too crazy. Best heckle? A couple got up in the middle of my show and walked out and said: \u201cWe\u2019re leaving because we\u2019re going to go have sex.\u201d I can\u2019t compete with that. This was in Greenwich Village at a bar where I did shows all the time, years ago. I said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s probably more productive than what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Any pet peeves from the world of standup? I don\u2019t like it when a host asks if it\u2019s anyone\u2019s birthday or if anyone\u2019s celebrating anything. Because I just don\u2019t care. What\u2019s one of the strangest fan encounters you\u2019ve had? I had someone follow me into a hotel I was staying at and get in the elevator to tell me that they were a big fan. They said: \u201cI followed you for two blocks.\u201d I said: \u201cOh you\u2019re not staying at the hotel?\u201d They said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m a fan.\u201d It\u2019s very strange when someone tells you that in an enclosed space. I would never follow someone into a hotel elevator. They were very nice, but that was terrifying. Best piece of advice you\u2019ve ever been given? Don\u2019t overestimate your worth. Worst piece of advice you\u2019ve ever been given? You can do anything you put your mind to. \u2022 Tim Dillon: American Royalty tours Manchester, Glasgow and London from 4-7 April",

        "body": "The passion of cinephilia is the subject of this absorbing personal essay movie from Iranian critic and film historian Ehsan Khoshbakht, now co-director of the Il Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna, Italy, who narrates the film in a style that reminded me a little of Mark Cousins and also perhaps Werner Herzog. Khoshbakht grew up in post-revolutionary Iran where he developed a love of movies and of moving images generally, even the sternly meagre output on national TV. I laughed out loud at Khoshbakht\u2019s entranced description of the TV\u2019s humble colour test card: \u201cAs exciting as an MGM musical!\u201d Khoshbakht (daringly) started a film club as a teenager, digitally projecting foreign movies videotaped from TV. He got into serious trouble for showing the Iranian classic The Cow by director Dariush Mehrjui, an anti-government protestor who was murdered last year (and sadly not included in the Oscars in memoriam section). But even more importantly, Khoshbakht got to know an extraordinary man called Ahmad Jorghanian, a dedicated rescuer of 35mm films and posters whom this film honours as the \u201cIranian Henri Langlois\u201d; that is, Iran\u2019s unofficial equivalent of the celebrated French archivist and preservationist, hero of the 60s French New Wave. But unlike Jorghanian, Langlois was never arrested and tortured for his westernised film collection. Jorghanian spent decades hoarding cans of film in his chaotic apartment and in cramped basements and hiding places all over Tehran, buying them from the warehouses and junk shops into which they had been dumped after being confiscated. Khoshbakht was able to project at least some of this illicit treasure trove on a samizdat basis, using borrowed projection facilities, and is ecstatic seeing these movies come to life once more. In exile in London, Khoshbakht hears about the death of his old friend, and ponders the fate of Jorghanian\u2019s collection: is film, like our own vulnerable human bodies, liable to decay into dusty nothingness? Historians will still protect what material they can, and protect the cinephilic language and culture that allows these films to be appreciated. \u2022 Celluloid Underground is at Bertha DocHouse, London, from 28 March",

        "body": "The owner of Legoland, Alton Towers and Madame Tussauds is planning to introduce budget airline-style surge pricing, so families will pay more on peak summer weekends than rainy weekdays, as visitor numbers have fallen since the pandemic. Scott O\u2019Neil, the chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, which owns 141 attractions in 23 countries, said the group was aiming to introduce a dynamic pricing model \u2013 widely known as surge pricing \u2013 at its top 20 global attractions by the end of this year, and big US attractions next year. \u201cIf [an attraction] is in the UK, it\u2019s August peak holiday season, sunny and a Saturday, you would expect to pay more than if it was a rainy Tuesday in March,\u201d O\u2019Neil told the Financial Times. The system will use machine learning to flex prices in response to supply and demand \u2013 in a similar way to that already deployed by cut-price airlines, cab-hailing services such as Uber and some hotels. Technology has made the technique increasingly popular with companies, but less so with their customers. The US burger chain Wendy\u2019s was forced to rush out a statement promising it \u201cwould not raise prices when our customers are visiting us most,\u201d \u2013 and only drop prices at less popular times \u2013 after announcing it would begin to trial surge pricing last month. Merlin said in a statement that the new system \u201cbrings us in line with competitors and the broader holiday industry that have similar pricing structures, which benefit guests who choose to book off-peak\u201d. It said the changes would \u201cenable greater flexibility for guests booking online to choose discounted prices for select dates and times.\u201d \u201cTo ensure we continue to deliver the best value and experience for our guests, we regularly review our pricing structure and admission prices in line with the marketplace and we reduce them in off peak periods. This also makes sure that the peak period experience is optimised by avoiding overcrowding. This approach clearly works because our guest satisfaction is at an all-time high.\u201d The scheme emerged as Merlin, which was taken private in 2019, revealed sales had risen 8% last year to a record \u00a32.1bn, led by the return of international tourists to big cities including London where the group operates the London Eye and the London Dungeon as well as Madame Tussauds. However, visitor numbers to the company\u2019s attractions had yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. About 62 million people visited its 141 attractions across 23 countries last year, 13% up on the previous year but still well below the 67 million visitors recorded in 2019.",

        "body": "It began as a story about a mysterious plaque on a Bristol bench \u2013 but the strange tale of an engraved tribute to a deceased adulterer is now raising wider questions about copyright and who gets credit for creativity in the art world. Photos of the brass plate paying tribute to a supposedly deceased adulterer called Roger went viral last week, after it was affixed to a wooden bench on Royal York Crescent in the upmarket district of Clifton. Who put up the plaque commemorating the \u201chusband, father, adulterer\u201d \u2013 which included the payoff line \u201cRoger, I knew\u201d \u2013 remains unknown. But while locals speculated that Banksy may have been involved, another artist has now suggested they are the victim of a rip-off. The London-based creator, who operates under the name The Misfortuneteller, said he created a near-identical plaque in March 2020 after wandering around New York\u2019s Central Park and looking at the inscriptions on benches. \u201cPlaques are fine but they\u2019re not really that truthful,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to do honest memorial plaques. Bittersweet ones.\u201d He mocked-up a series of images featuring offbeat tributes to the deceased. Some of the designs were sold as real engraved plaques. An ex-girlfriend is commemorated with a real-life plaque reading: \u201cFor Barbara \u2013 Who was awful when hungry but otherwise pretty solid.\u201d Others took on a life of their own after going viral, often being shared without credit or posted by meme aggregation accounts on Instagram. No one bought his design paying tribute to a \u201ccherished husband, dad and adulterer\u201d, even though the image proved popular online. As a result, The Misfortuneteller said he was surprised to see his original design and phrasing reappear on the Bristol bench this week, prompting him to say: \u201cIt\u2019s not Banksy\u2019s; it\u2019s fucking mine.\u201d Whoever put up the Bristol plaque had used almost exactly the same phrasing as the original 2020 design, albeit changing the name of the supposedly deceased adulterer. And while there is no suggestion they are seeking to profit from their actions, the original artist said they felt infuriated by the potential copyright infringement: \u201cI\u2019m mad at the person who took this, copied it, and put it on a bench. It\u2019s a reflection of how intellectual property these days is so hard to enforce.\u201d He said there was a tension between delight at creating work that resonated with the public and not receiving any credit for it. \u201cIt\u2019s just interesting how things go viral \u2013 on the one hard you should be pleased that you\u2019re amusing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if a million people like your post you get nothing from it.\u201d Drawing a parallel to the early days of illegal music downloads on the internet, the artist said: \u201cEven my followers say I should be happy. It\u2019s a bit like Napster \u2013 the internet is used to getting things for free and they expect to get everything for free and not to credit everybody. There\u2019s an assumption that if you find something amusing and share that the person doing it is doing really well.\u201d There is a long history of fake plaques in the UK. In 2013 a man emigrating to Australia left behind a bench inscription reading \u201cIn memory of Roger Bucklesby, who hated this park and everyone in it.\u201d A fake English Heritage blue plaque commemorating the residence of Victorian timetraveller Jacob von Hogflume appeared on a London townhouse in 2012. And the artist Gavin Turk created a plaque as a mocking tribute to his own importance while still a young artist. The Misfortuneteller insisted he did not want to stop others creating subversive plaques. He said he appreciated it was a powerful and effective medium: \u201cThere are other artists in my orbit who have attempted to do plaques. I have never said I own all plaques, just like I don\u2019t own ink and paper. I feel this is different because it\u2019s word-for-word.\u201d",

        "body": "What a pleasure it is to find a novel that\u2019s unlike anything else out there, that succeeds on its own idiosyncratic terms and leaves the reader\u2019s head ringing. Headshot is American writer Rita Bullwinkel\u2019s first novel, after her collection of stories Belly Up (2016), and it takes us deep into the world of teenage girl boxers. The setting is the 12th Annual Daughters of America Cup, held in the \u201ctin warehouse\u201d of Bob\u2019s Boxing Palace in Reno, Nevada: a two-day competition of fists and fury, with eight fighters in three knockout rounds. We get into the heads of all eight girls, the narrative passing easily from one to another through brief moments of connection. What\u2019s most impressive is how, in a relatively short novel with so many central characters, Bullwinkel manages to make each girl spark distinctively on the page \u2013 even if this means each tends towards a single overwhelming personality trait. There\u2019s Artemis Victor, the third in a line of boxing sisters (the judges treat her family \u201clike old friends\u201d), and in her own estimation the prettiest of the fighters in the tournament: \u201cThere\u2019s one woman, over there, who may be prettier, if you like women who look like drug addicts.\u201d But she is haunted by the knowledge that even if she wins, \u201cshe\u2019ll still be second best to her oldest sister\u201d. Artemis hates her opponent Andi Taylor, but wants to be her friend afterwards. The intimacy of the violence they\u2019re engaged in can do that. For Andi\u2019s part, she cannot stop ruminating on the sight of her father\u2019s dead body, and without him, \u201cshe needed another person in her life to tell her that she was a real person, and that she might not be special, but she was fine\u201d. Then there\u2019s Rachel Doricko, who likes to frighten people \u2013 \u201cit is amazing the power that a strange hat will give you\u201d \u2013 and her opponent Kate Heffer, who comes with plans and projects, which means that when they hit reality (or are hit by it), she collapses. We get glimpses of the audience too, mostly family members \u201capplauding for something, applauding for anything\u201d, but the girls are fundamentally alone. The fights themselves show the necessary blend of mental and physical endurance that approaches the metaphysical horror of the dance marathon in Horace McCoy\u2019s They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They? To the fighters, success \u2013 one \u201cwins quickly, like a mother putting toys away in a toy box at the end of the day\u201d \u2013 is all the sweeter because they know what it means to fail at something that means more to you than anything else. Headshot speaks of putting everything you\u2019ve got into one aspect of your life: \u201cA life taken over can be wonderful. But it can also be sappy and stupid and dramatic.\u201d What happens when the curtain goes down on the only thing you do? We get sly Muriel Spark-like shots forward to the future: \u201cWhen Artemis is 60 she won\u2019t be able to hold a cup of tea\u201d because of her boxing injuries. Another fighter will become an actor, \u201ca beloved typecast granny\u201d. Headshot feels like the complete deal in a way we rarely see in debut fiction: efficient, forceful, just messy enough to be interesting and leaving space in the ring for the reader. If this, after Kathryn Scanlan\u2019s Kick the Latch last year, is part of a new trend for fantastically unclassifiable books about women in sport, I\u2019m in. \u2022 Headshot by Rita Bullwinkel is published by Daunt Books (\u00a39.99).

        "body": "Twenty years ago, Rafael Bonachela was a major new talent in UK dance. A Spaniard who\u2019d spent years dancing in London with Rambert and was making waves with his choreography. But in 2009 he left to become artistic director at Sydney Dance Company, so this show is a bit of a homecoming. The triple bill, titled Ascent, opens with a short piece of Bonachela\u2019s own, I Am-ness, and it\u2019s a reminder of the quality of his choreography: 10 minutes of beautiful movement, set to the keening and soaring violin of Lonely Angel by Latvian composer P\u0113teris Vasks. It\u2019s less frenetic than some of Bonachela\u2019s early works, and takes time and pleasure in the facility of the four dancers in long, continuous, ever-evolving phrases. They\u2019re on their individual paths, but en route they connect, they embrace; they need each other. It\u2019s all very human, while being technically impressive \u2013 this is a company of strong, versatile dancers, and what they show in Ascent is work that\u2019s solidly movement and music-led, dancing round the edges of abstraction. Marina Mascarell\u2019s The Shell, a Ghost, the Host &amp; the Lyrebird opens feeling like early morning, with stillness and subdued light, and sparse shimmering music. From the ceiling fall ropes and swathes of fabric, like a ship\u2019s rigging, and there\u2019s the subtle impression of a voyage somewhere, choreography gently rocked by the water\u2019s undertow. It\u2019s a dreamy piece, although its potency wanes, not dissimilar to Antony Hamilton\u2019s Forever &amp; Ever, which is built like a big crescendo with a fizzle-out ending. Forever &amp; Ever looks fab though, and it\u2019s full of striking visual surprises, mostly courtesy of costume designer Paula Levis. The dancers emerge in hooded cloaks and cone-shaped hands, like a cross between The Traitors and a Pet Shop Boys gig. There is constant transformation, from monochrome to colour, from silence to a stark electro beat of increasing intensity, a slow build of adrenaline. The dancers are often tight to the music in a kind of 4/4 semaphore, slaves to the rhythm, but this is definitely not a party; it\u2019s very cool, very controlled. And it\u2019s very watchable. The programme feels fresh without being particularly experimental, and Bonachela\u2019s choreography and Levis\u2019 costumes especially bring sparks of joy. \u2022 At Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London until 28 March",

        "body": "You could argue that mind-numbing tasks are fine distractions in winter, but summer is about making more time to do less. Here are some yawn-worthy tasks to edit out of your life so you can have the summer you really want. 1 Attending formal meetings Transform dull sit-downs by keeping on the move with a walking meeting \u2013 taking in the air, the sights, the exercise gains! Works online with headphones or IRL with a colleague. 2 Wrestling with your lawnmower Why should you mow, when a Honda Miimo robotic lawnmower can do it? The robotic lawn-trimming champ Miimo is happy to take over, so get it set up then retire to the terrace to watch (or don\u2019t \u2013 the new range has Bluetooth connectivity as standard and the option for 3G/4G too). And if you want to keep things really simple, the HRM 1000 \u2013 with its pared-back display \u2013 is your friend. 3 Endless procrastination Do the thing! Don\u2019t just talk about your dreams, make them happen. Start the painting, write the book, train for that 5km run. A little at a time is better than not at all, so work out the smallest first step you can take and do that. 4 Taking the same old route Satnav is a godsend but also as adventurous as a plain baked potato. Instead, mix it up and go your own way; it\u2019ll make the journey feel more interesting and could help to keep your brain active, too. 5 Continually updating your socials Less is more. Constructing a plausible, yet aspirational, reality for anonymous onlookers is time consuming. Stick to a couple of posts a week \u2013 that way, your audience will be more pleased to see you. 6 Pruning Choose slow-growing evergreens, such as azaleas or dwarf rhododendrons, and back away from the secateurs. For structure, slow-growing dwarf conifers provide a wide range of colours and diverse shapes with minimal effort. All do well in glazed frost-proof containers if you like your plants on your patio. 7 Seeking garden perfection Not every corner of your garden needs to be manicured and pristine. Rewild a section and let nature take its course. The bumblebees will thank you and the random, tangled beauty of it all will make quite the contrast. Tip: the Honda Miimo lets you leave some longer meadow sections for greater biodiversity. 8 Stressing over gift shopping When you see something you love, buy it, and keep it until you\u2019ve worked out who it\u2019s for. A go-to gift cupboard prevents an afternoon wasted hunting for last-minute panic buys. 9 Wondering what to wear Have a couple of hangers of trusted outfits on standby, always ready to go. For some reason, picking out clothes the night before takes half as long \u2013 perhaps because you\u2019re more awake \u2013 and means the befuddled morning version of you has one less fire to fight. 10 Waiting in for deliveries You never hear the doorbell anyway. If you\u2019re able, click-and-collect is the one. It gets you out of the house, or gives you a nice diversion on the way home from wherever you\u2019ve been having much more fun. 11 Counting down to holidays There\u2019s more to time off than your bumper vacation. There\u2019s joy to be found in a day off here and there, doing something local, lowkey and fun \u2013 maybe even a little hands-off gardening, watching your Miimo gobble up grass while you relax. 12 Weeding Weeds can\u2019t thrive where there\u2019s no light, so make your flowerbeds too busy for invaders to get a look in. Cotoneaster dammeri (also known as bearberry cotoneaster) is evergreen, produces attractive berries, and is ideal for ground cover, along with evergreen pachysandras, also known as green carpet. 13 Spending forever cleaning Set yourself a time limit and be realistic about what can be done. To make it feel more fun and stave off boredom, spruce up the place in zones, stick on a playlist or set challenges for yourself as you do it. How many colour-themed things can you put away? It works! 14 Feeling guilty about being inside on a summer\u2019s day It\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to spend all day gently baking in the sunshine. Give yourself permission to binge on a box set or read on the sofa (all while Miimo does the hard work for you and keeps your lawn in tiptop shape). 15 Watching reality TV They fight, they make up, they fight again, they take longer to make up, and repeat \u2013 until you realise you\u2019ve been stationary for eight hours. There is no plot, so don\u2019t lose your own. 16 Hovering over high maintenance plants Open to feeling the dirt under your fingernails but don\u2019t want to be tied to attention-seeking flora? Cherry tomatoes, asparagus, beans, onions and peppers pretty much do their own thing once planted, you just need to show up with the water and an encouraging smile. 17 Jumping on a work call A \u201cquick call\u201d almost never is. Ask for, or offer, an emailed precis instead. Everyone can read at their leisure, be more focused, and not feel under pressure to find immediate solutions. And if it has to be a call, be sure it has an agenda \u2013 and therefore an end in sight. 18 Waiting for your phone to charge A battery pack doesn\u2019t take up much space, so you\u2019ll always be connected, and you can keep up with the group chat while you\u2019re out in the garden. 19 Ordering the same thing at a restaurant Favourites are favourites for a reason, but how did they become your most-loved foods? Because you took a chance and tried them the first time, right? Open your mind and enrich your palate. 20 Endless to-do lists Start a tiny, achievable one to feel that rush of completion. 21 Cleaning garden furniture Invest in a good quality hardwood set of garden furniture that can withstand the elements and doesn\u2019t require any treatment, such as iroko, teak, or sapele mahogany. 22 Saying yes to things you don\u2019t want to do Stop doing things you don\u2019t want to (you could start with letting a robotic lawnmower such as the Honda Miimo sort your lawn out instead of putting in the hard work yourself), and you could literally find yourself with hours of extra time on your hands to do the things you actually enjoy. Those long summer nights are meant to be adored, after all, not ignored. Find out more about how the latest Honda Miimo robotic lawnmowers could transform your lawn",

        "body": "As chair of judges for the inaugural Women\u2019s prize for nonfiction, it has been a privilege to read some of the best work produced in English by women in the last year. From our longlist of 16 fantastic titles, my fellow judges Venetia La Manna, Nicola Rollock, Anne Sebba, Kamila Shamsie and I have chosen a shortlist of six must-read books. The first (in order of author\u2019s surname) is Thunderclap, by Observer art critic Laura Cumming. The author draws attention to the genius of an overlooked artist, Carel Fabritius and, by extension, makes us look anew at the whole of Dutch art. Amid this she weaves in sections of memoir about her artist father. Deeply researched and meticulously wrought, this is tender, electric and highly original. Cumming has a real gift for putting paintings into words: she helps the reader to see things that they might have otherwise missed. She is a master of structure, and her diction is gorgeous, while the revelation on the last page is breathtakingly poignant. From the starting point of Naomi Klein\u2019s discomfort at being continually mistaken for the \u201cother Naomi\u201d, feminist turned conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf, Doppelganger spirals out to examine the tribal nature of politics today. Klein, writer, climate activist and Guardian US columnist, gives us language with which to conceive of the \u201cmirror world\u201d in which we find ourselves. Her forensic dissection of the strange political realities we are living amid is elegantly crafted into a narrative arc. Doppelganger is deeply clever, original and insightful, and also that harder thing for a book of nonfiction: humorous. A Flat Place by Noreen Masud is a beguiling mix of landscape and memory. By meditating on the nature of flat topography \u2013 that it conveys an undemanding sense of security and peace \u2013 and contrasting that with her harrowed and confined childhood, the lecturer at the University of Bristol constructs something utterly original and haunting. Her beautiful and tender prose inducts one into a completely new way of seeing the world \u2013 a vision that is absorbing, evocative and memorable. Harvard professor Tiya Miles\u2019s All That She Carried is a work of monumental historical excavation. With extraordinary imagination, Miles tells the story of a sack given in the 1850s by a woman called Rose to her nine-year-old daughter, Ashley, when Ashley was being sold away from her. The sack was later embroidered by Ashley\u2019s granddaughter. Miles uses this artefact to investigate the hidden lives of enslaved women. Carefully judged, deeply researched, and exquisitely written, All That She Carried is a masterclass in how to contend with the absences of enslaved people in the archives. It brims with intelligence and love. Code Dependent is an astute and gripping examination of how existing imbalances of power are being replicated, even exacerbated, by AI. Madhumita Murgia, the Financial Times\u2019s first artificial intelligence editor, deeply understands tech, but her primary interest is the humanity behind it. The power of this book lies in the rich stories it tells of individuals confronting new manifestations of very old power structures. Drawing on interviews from around the globe, this highly readable and deeply important book exposes AI\u2019s sordid underbelly. The poet Safiya Sinclair turns her hand to memoir in How to Say Babylon, an exquisite book about growing up in a Rastafarian family in Jamaica. As a work of autobiography, it is moving, poignant, and even distressing, but Sinclair also tells an illuminating broader story about postcolonial Jamaica, religious fundamentalism, and patriarchy \u2013 and how a mother\u2019s love can almost overcome it all. Beautifully written and original in its use of language, it is also a wonderfully compelling read and utterly unforgettable. On the surface, these books tell six very different stories, spanning continents and centuries. Yet these writers are not only all deft of phrase and original in approach, but each responds uniquely to perceived injustice. They remind us how important it is to heed the perspectives that women bring. \u2022 The winner of the 2024 Women\u2019s prize for nonfiction will be announced on 13 June.

        "body": "Donald Trump\u2019s social network went public on Tuesday and quickly achieved a valuation of almost $8bn (\u00a36.3bn), a gain of more than 15% on its initial public offering (IPO) value. Shares rose again in volatile trading on Wednesday, rising 14% and valuing it at $9.6bn. That enormous success has raised questions, and not all of them are easy to answer. How can it possibly be worth $9bn? The glib answer is \u201cbecause the most recent price someone bought a share of the company at is $66.46\u201d. The valuation of a publicly traded company such as Truth Social \u2013 officially, the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group Corp, with the stock ticker DJT, referencing its founder\u2019s initials \u2013 is just a product of multiplying the value of an individual share with the number outstanding. Typically, that value, known as the market capitalisation, is kept in check by reference to the \u201cfundamentals\u201d of the company: how much money it makes or loses, and how fast it is growing or shrinking. But sometimes \u2026 it isn\u2019t. In the case of Truth Social, its revenue during the first nine months of last year was just $3.3m from advertising, and it recorded a loss of $49m. Why don\u2019t investors care about the fundamentals? Historically, the big reason why stock valuations become detached from reality is speculative bubbles. Even if you don\u2019t think a company is particularly valuable, it may still be worth buying their stock at a high price if you think you can sell it on at an even higher price. But Truth Social seems to be part of a more recent phenomenon: the \u201cmeme stock\u201d. What is a meme stock? The term was coined to describe a small group of publicly traded stocks that have attracted a big proportion of private \u201cretail\u201d investors. Those investors typically use zero-commission trading apps such as Robinhood to take a much more active role in the markets than has been typical for individuals until recently, and coordinate on social media, particularly sites such as Reddit, to share stock tips. Infamously, the valuation of the American video game retailer GameStop rose by more than 1,800%, after a critical mass of investors coordinated on the WallStreetBets subreddit to take a stake. The investors\u2019 theory was that an engineered \u201cshort squeeze\u201d could force those who had \u201cshorted\u201d GameStop \u2013 that is, bet on its share price falling \u2013 to buy the shares back at inflated valuations. Three years on, GameStop remains almost 10 times more valuable than it was just before it achieved meme stock status \u2013 and just a quarter off its peak. Is Truth Social a true meme stock? Investors in Donald Trump\u2019s social network definitely have a lot in common with those in the GameStop bubble. Coordinating online to boost a share\u2019s value with lots of little investments from individuals, rather than big corporate investors, is a similar story to GameStop and other meme stocks such as the cinema chain AMC or the rental company Hertz. But unlike those shareholders, there is little sense that the Truth Social investors are driven by, or even care about, turning a profit on their stake. Instead, buying in is seen as a chance to invest in Trump \u2013 or even just to show your support for the man. In that way, Truth Social has less in common with other meme stocks and more with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrencies \u2013 a market the former president has also dabbled in. Can Trump sell out early? With legal bills in the millions \u2013 including one reduced this week from $454m to a still hefty $175m \u2013 the big question for many is whether the Truth Social float will allow Trump to turn his newfound paper wealth into hard cash. Officially, the answer is a simple \u201cno\u201d: the IPO agreement requires insiders to hold their stake for six months after the company goes public. But that can be overruled by a vote from the company\u2019s board of directors, which includes such independent votes as Donald Trump Jr, and Linda McMahon and Robert Lighthizer, two former officials in Trump\u2019s administration. Even if they choose not to authorise a sale, they may offer a halfway house, rewriting the agreement so that Trump Sr can use his shares as collateral for a loan. Will Truth Social ever make money? A few years ago, it was possible to foresee a rosy future for Truth Social. The increasing polarisation of American society meant the conditions were ripe for a rightwing social network, in contrast to the Silicon Valley ideology that dominated online. Truth Social, with its backing from Trump, felt like the most likely to succeed in that space, against the 4chan-inflected tone of its precursor Gab and the Trump-allied site Parler. Then Elon Musk bought Twitter. Under the billionaire\u2019s ownership, the site, rebranded as X, has become the home of the online right on its own, shedding a fifth of its users in the process. There\u2019s plenty of criticisms one can lay at the feet of Musk, but being censorious of rightwing viewpoints isn\u2019t one: one of his first acts upon taking control was to rescind Trump\u2019s ban from the platform \u2013 all for nothing, since the former president continued to post on Truth Social instead.",

        "body": "From a fancy fragrance to a simple bowl of oranges, scent can transform how you feel about yourself, another person or a place. But how can you work out what suits the moment? And the best way to get rid of a stink? Perfumers reveal how to make your world smell fantastic. 1. Smell is an extreme sensation \u201cScent provokes a visceral reaction,\u201d says Ezra-Lloyd Jackson, a perfumer and artist who makes wearable fragrances under the brand name deya and creates scent installations for art exhibitions. What fascinates him about working with scent is the process of transforming \u201csomething that is grotesque or alarming into something that is familiar and comforting, or vice versa\u201d. 2. Your reaction to a smell is linked to memory Maya Njie makes perfumes inspired by her Swedish and Gambian heritage. She tried to capture this feeling in other artistic forms before realising that what she really wanted was to portray the way it smelled. \u201cWe know that our sense of smell is directly linked to the part of the brain where our memories are stored,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it makes a lot of sense that fragrance and smells are connected to our memories. If you smell something that someone has worn, or you go to a house that belongs to your grandparents, smelling makes you feel way more emotional than a photo ever could.\u201d Jackson describes this as \u201cinternal time travel. It is another form of communication that isn\u2019t linguistic.\u201d 3. It is possible to train your nose \u201cThat is what perfume is all about,\u201d says Jackson. He didn\u2019t have a very orthodox route into perfumery: \u201cI went straight into a laboratory and got to work, but most people will train at one of the schools in France, where the first year is all about learning 500 smells.\u201d Brighton-based French perfumer Elodie Durande, who works for Somerset label Ffern, honed her craft at the University of Montpellier. \u201cYou start out by working on your olfactory skills, remembering smells and describing smells,\u201d before receiving a wide-ranging education about the perfume industry, she says. Learning about scent applies not just to those who work in it, but those who wear it, too. \u201cYou can figure out what scent suits you by literally going around in your regular life and being sure to smell,\u201d says Mandy Aftel, a natural perfumer who lives in Berkeley, California and runs a fragrance museum, the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents. \u201cParticipate more in your life, bring your consciousness into a cup of coffee or when you\u2019re baking; smell the oven and the smells of baking will evolve. All we need to do is close our eyes, inhale and be there. And it will become clear to you what you like.\u201d 4. You can change how you feel about a smell \u2013 if you want to \u201cIf there is a perfume that someone wore when you were younger and it makes you feel uncomfortable, or an ex-partner wore a perfume and you smell it again, it can be interesting to reclaim that smell,\u201d says Njie. \u201cSo instead of smelling it every now and again, and feeling the way that you do, you would buy a sample of it and start wearing it \u2013 doing things that make you dissociate from that particular person. You can recreate memories and connections to it.\u201d But you should proceed with caution, advises Aftel: \u201cIf a fragrance reminds you of someone who stopped your heart, you should avoid it. It is a part of who you are and that should be honoured. On the other hand, if you really got over that person, it may be a victory dance to feel that it no longer bothers you. But it has to be an evolution inside of you.\u201d 5. Take your time choosing a fragrance You need to be in the right mood when shopping for a new scent, explains Lyn Harris, the perfumer behind the Perfume H and Miller Harris labels. \u201cIt\u2019s like choosing an item of clothing \u2013 you have to be calm and not in a rush.\u201d Don\u2019t be intimidated by fragrance, she says. Tell the sales assistant the kind of things you like and they will help you to find something. 6. Pick a fragrance for the time of year \u201cFind a fragrance that fits you for the season,\u201d says Harris. \u201cI think that is key because that is how we treat our wardrobe in general; it needs to be reinvigorated and fragrance is the same, because it will stop working for you just like that. So go into it thinking, \u2018I am going to have one for spring. What do I want? Do I want something fresh? Do I want something green?\u2019 And then in the winter, you may think, \u2018I want something to cocoon me, to nurture me but smell sexy at the same time.\u2019\u201d 7. Test it on your skin \u201cOnce you\u2019ve found two fragrances that you quite like and they\u2019re doing something for you olfactory-wise, try them on your skin,\u201d says Harris. \u201cOne fragrance on each wrist and perhaps another somewhere up your arm. Try no more than three. It is quite good to take a tester card and then, maybe later in the day, check it and see if it\u2019s doing anything for you. But that initial skin contact and your reaction to it is very important. It should be giving you pleasure; making you feel inquisitive and emotional. Give it three to five minutes and if it\u2019s still working, that\u2019s a positive.\u201d Fragrance comes to life on the skin, says Njie. \u201cTemperature plays a part, which is why we spray on pulse points and it is why fragrance may come alive more in the summer, whereas in the winter it may be flatter.\u201d 8. Wear what you like, not what you think you should like Fragrance has traditionally been marketed as \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d \u2013 interestingly, certain flowery notes were once considered the latter \u2013 and something used to attract the object of your affection, says Njie, who makes gender neutral perfumes. \u201cBut really, all those lines are so blurred\u201d \u2013 now, it is more about \u201cmaking you feel a certain way about yourself, more confident or secure or all of these different emotions that fragrance can bring to us\u201d. 9. Scent can be used to lift or reflect your mood \u201cAll of my perfumes are very mood driven,\u201d says Aftel. \u201cI have some perfumes that are sad, some that are kind of sexy for a date night, others that are relaxing \u2013 like being in nature in the trees.\u201d They can also be chosen to mark a special occasion, such as a birthday, wedding or significant life change. \u201c[You can] dedicate a particular scent to it that isn\u2019t an every day one,\u201d says Jackson, setting yourself up to make new memories with your chosen fragrance. 10. Spritz where you will most enjoy it \u201cI spray on my wrist and on the back of my neck,\u201d says Njie, \u201cbecause I find that if you spray it at the front, you smell it constantly and get used to the fragrance faster than you would if it wasn\u2019t in your peripheral area the whole time. I like to spray it on my clothes, if I feel as if I\u2019ve got fabric that can handle it; I like it on a coat sleeve before I leave the house \u2013 that way I can access it more easily. My hair is very short but I know that the girls in the studio spray a bit and walk into it and it wafts in your hair throughout the day.\u201d Durande agrees that wearing perfume on your chest means you sense it too much, which soon means that \u201cyou can\u2019t consciously smell it anymore\u201d. The trick instead is to \u201ctry to apply it to different parts of your body, on your wrist or even on your legs \u2013 anywhere that has motion. That way, when you move, you will get a whiff of perfume.\u201d 11. Don\u2019t be too overpowering \u201cIt is good to keep other people in mind,\u201d says Njie. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in smaller spaces, travelling or working in an office, you may want to take others into account. I don\u2019t believe that if a fragrance reaches across the room and it is eye-watering, then it means that it is good and you have got a lot for your buck. Something that is subdued and more sophisticated can be equally as beautiful. It is nice to have a smell that is more intimate \u2013 that people who come close to you get to enjoy.\u201d Harris agrees: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s tasteful to invade other people\u2019s space with fragrance. It should be for you and those immediately close to you.\u201d When you can no longer smell your fragrance, reapply it to a different part of the body, suggests Durande. 12. Choose something that will last \u201cAnything with a deeper smell \u2013 something woody, ambery, richer \u2013 and sweeter scents like vanilla or caramels \u2026 these are all base notes, the longer lasting ingredients,\u201d says Durande. \u201cPerfumes that contain these will retain on the skin for a bit longer.\u201d 13. Think sustainably Njie\u2019s eponymous brand is vegan and \u201coffers refills, and uses recycled glass and paper packaging\u201d. But sustainability in perfume is not always straightforward, so make sure you read up on how brands operate before you buy. \u201cNatural does not equal being more sustainable or safer to wear,\u201d she says. \u201cIn certain cases, the synthetic molecules are better, as they carry a lower carbon footprint and fewer allergens.\u201d 14. How to tell a dupe The internet is awash with cunning copies of notable perfumes, and it can be hard to tell a real fragrance from a fake one. \u201cIf it is a really good dupe, you can\u2019t really tell,\u201d says Durande. \u201cIf it is a perfume that you\u2019ve been wearing for many years, every day, and you have a good sense of smell, you will probably pick up tiny differences. Because dupes are never 100% the same, even the good ones.\u201d 15. Sometimes it is better not to wear anything Durande barely wears fragrance. \u201cI work with smells all day long, all week, so in my free time I need a bit of a reset. I like to be in a neutral environment, to give my nose a bit of a rest,\u201d she says. Being scent-free at work, she explains, means that she can concentrate on smelling her creations all the better. 16. In the home, embrace how life smells Don\u2019t automatically turn to a candle or incense to give a room character, says Aftel. \u201cA lot of people will scent their home with those tired old fragranced candles that are quite synthetic. But how lovely would it be, say at a dinner party, to put out things that are fragrant that are not a candle, that encourage people to touch them. With a bowl of oranges, the oil is in the skin and they are very beautiful to look at. Or maybe having a little bouquet of mint so people can rip a leaf off. Or, if you have jasmine where you live, put that on the table with a bowl of peaches \u2013 they look and smell incredible together. I grow lemons so I always have a bowl of them out. Something very simple like that is a beautiful way to include fragrance in your life.\u201d Jackson, meanwhile, likes to embrace the smells of cooking rather than mask them, especially \u201ccardamom, frying sage with butter and cumin, honey and carrots \u2013 a match made in heaven\u201d. 17. Make your own scent rituals Njie does use candles and incense in her home. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I tend to do more after I\u2019ve done my chores, and it is time to relax. It\u2019s like a reward for doing something. I wouldn\u2019t light a candle if I\u2019ve got loads of stuff to do.\u201d Durande opts for palo santo or Papier d\u2019Arm\u00e9nie, which reminds her of childhood, for a similar unwinding effect. Jackson cannily sprays radiators with fragrance \u2013 as they warm, the scent is released. 18. To remove the smell of garlic from hands \u2026 \u201cWash your hands with cold water first,\u201d says Durande, \u201cbecause the hot water opens up the pores in your skin. If you clean up with hot water, some of those garlic smells are going to be trapped deeper in your skin. I\u2019ve noticed that if you rinse off or wash your hands with cold water first, it removes it better. You don\u2019t get so much in your skin, and then you can do a second wash with warm water and soap.\u201d 19. Consider your laundry detergent \u201cThe stuff that people use to scent laundry sticks around for so long,\u201d says Aftel. \u201cI believe very strongly in a person choosing to engage with a smell and choosing when it comes to an end. So if you have stuff that lasts for a really long time, or blankets things, I feel like the person smelling it may falsely think they don\u2019t like it, or that it\u2019s too much. A natural smell has an arc over time. They last, then \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013 disappear.\u201d 20. To get rid of a bad smell \u2026 \u201cI would just open a window and get a draught going,\u201d says Njie. \u201cBecause otherwise you\u2019re layering over the bad smell \u2013 it is better to try to get rid of it.\u201d Aftel suggests putting frankincense resin over a tea light: \u201cIt fills your house with a beautiful, natural smell and you could cover something up with that very easily.\u201d Aside from that, she adds, simply \u201copen the windows and pray\u201d.",

        "body": "Four of Canada\u2019s largest school boards have launched a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the social media companies Meta, Snap Inc and ByteDance, accusing them of acting in a \u201chigh-handed, reckless, malicious, and reprehensible manner\u201d with products the boards claim harm student learning and \u201crewire\u201d how children think. The four district boards \u2013 Ottawa-Carleton, Toronto, Peel and Toronto Catholic \u2013 filed four separate statements of claim in Ontario\u2019s superior court of justice on Wednesday. \u201cThe lawsuit claims that social media products, negligently designed for compulsive use, have rewired the way children think, behave, and learn, leaving educators and schools to manage the fallout,\u201d the boards said in a statement, adding the companies used \u201cexploitative business practices\u201d and chose to \u201cmaximize profits\u201d instead of focusing on the mental health and wellbeing of students. None of the allegations have been proven in court. In recent years, educators have spend a growing share of their time in the classroom attempting to get students to focus, the boards said. They blame the addictive nature of social media and apps like Instagram, TikTok and SnapChat which they say have also led to a spike in cyberbullying and mental health issues. To compensate for mounting administrative costs of the fallout, as well as the \u201cstrain\u201d on the teachers, the boards are seeking C$4.5bn (US$3.3bn) from the companies. The lawsuit is the first of its kind in Canada, but follows similar efforts in the United States amid a growing concern over the developmental effects of social media on young users. In a statement Snap said the platform was \u201cintentionally designed to be different from traditional social media\u201d so that users could communicate with friends. \u201cWhile we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence,\u201d the company said. Meta and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

I have had the privilege to work in two boarding schools for over a decade and, along with my colleagues, am proud to contribute to the warm and comprehensive pastoral care of the young people in our care. The health, happiness and confidence of our students is paramount and at the forefront of everything we do. Most of our pupils are on generous bursaries of 80% or more of their boarding fees, with many being fully funded, so it is not the case that boarding is always the preserve of the wealthy, nor that it is for parents who wish to foist their children on others. All of my students are at boarding school to pursue the vocational aspects it offers, and not because their parents don\u2019t want them, as was historically the case for some pupils and as is implied by almost all accounts from \u201cboarding school survivors\u201d. Boarding has changed, and for many young people it is an incredibly enriching experience.

        "body": "Brilliant, entrancing, exhausting, and with thermonuclear showtunes from Richard and Robert Sherman, Disney\u2019s hybrid live-action/animation classic from 1964 is now rereleased on home entertainment platforms for its 60th anniversary. And it has a brand-new certificate from the BBFC: upgraded from a U to a PG on account of \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d from the eccentric seadog character Admiral Boom, who fires a cannon from his roof shouting \u201cFight the Hottentots!\u201d (an obsolete term for South Africa\u2019s indigenous Khoekhoe people). However the BBFC is evidently not bothered by the foxhunting scene in which the fox has a cod Irish accent (perhaps because chimney sweep Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, saves the fox), nor by the cheerful suicide reference made by one of the servants: \u201cNice spot there by Southwark Bridge, very popular with jumpers!\u201d In an upmarket part of Edwardian London created on almost dreamlike artificial sets in California, the prosperous upper-middle-class Banks family are having problems controlling their high-spirited children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice); this is grumpy banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns), who is always whirling around going to votes-for-women marches. Pompous Mr Banks saunters into the action with complacent song The Life I Lead (which melodically owes a tiny bit to With a Little Bit of Luck from the stage show My Fair Lady). And so the magical nanny Mary Poppins wafts miraculously down from the heavens to solve all their problems \u2013 and this is the glorious movie debut of Julie Andrews, glowing with health and beauty and confidence. Andrews will always be associated with this superb performance, and of course her later appearance in The Sound of Music, in which she also artlessly cures a family\u2019s woes. I have always preferred Andrews in The Sound of Music, because defying the Nazis is more exciting and worthwhile than wimpishly going on a jolly holiday, and feeding the (verminous) birds at tuppence a bag etc. But no one can doubt the lethal power of Mary Poppins. (Naming Mary\u2019s preferred alcoholic cocktail is always a great film quiz standby.) But when uptight Mr Banks takes the kids to his place of employment and young Michael inadvertently causes the biggest run on a bank since Frank Capra\u2019s It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, this stern paterfamilias loses his position and is forced to consider his whole life and how he has been neglecting his children in favour of work (although happily it\u2019s not a quandary he\u2019s in for very long). It is Mary who introduces the children to the madcap chimney sweep Bert, played by Van Dyke with his notoriously awful cockney accent \u2013 which is even more awful considering that Hermione Baddeley is right there, robustly playing the Banks family\u2019s maid Ellen, and giving us a much more convincing London voice. (Actually, Van Dyke\u2019s posh voice as old Mr Dawes is much better.) From the first time I saw this film as a kid, and again now, I have always wondered: are Bert and Mary in love or not? Mary sings to him: \u201cGentlemen like you are few / Though you\u2019re just a diamond in the rough, Bert / Underneath, your blood is blue / You\u2019d never think of pressing your advantage / Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed / A lady needn\u2019t fear when you are near \u2026\u201d Pressing his \u201cadvantage\u201d? A lady not needing to fear? Well, I should hope not, though perhaps poor Bert certainly does have a hopeless platonic thing for Mary, possibly the most romantically unattainable figure in film history. She is also arguably a manic pixie dream nanny, though it\u2019s Bert who is also manic, particularly when he does his interminable Step in Time rooftop knees-up with all the other sweeps. There are lots of genius moments here, and A Spoonful of Sugar and Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious are amazing songs. I have to admit that I find the real brilliance of the film is in the first act and things have wound down by the end, but what an entertainment sugar rush. \u2022 Mary Poppins is in UK cinemas from 29 March, and also screening in select Australian cinemas.",

        "body": "Hundreds of vintage fanatics, dressed in tailor-made suits and berets, are expected to descend on London this weekend for a three-day event celebrating mod subculture. Modstock, launched 30 years ago by a British vintage fanatic, Rob Bailey, and his organisation New Untouchables, returns for its fourth edition. Taking place only every 10 years, each edition of Modstock is a three-day and all-night event with vintage car shows, talks and panels, live music, market stalls, a scooter run, club nights, and a Thames boat party. \u201cWe are celebrating the culture which has, over the last six decades, influenced a lot of things in this country \u2013 particularly music and fashion, which is two of our greatest exports,\u201d said Bailey. Modstock will take place in west London, and welcomes 60s icons including the singers PP Arnold and Fay Hallam and the drummer Kenney Jones. It will also host bands, DJs, clothes makers, vintage car sellers and more who were not around in the 60s but drew great inspiration from it. Bailey said: \u201cWe are having people from all over the world. Mod now is not just something that is unique to the UK, it\u2019s worldwide and the fanbase is always changing it in their own ways. There\u2019ll be people from all over the world coming to London this weekend to celebrate that.\u201d David Davidson, who is celebrating his 60th birthday this year, has travelled from Toronto, Canada, to be at Modstock. \u201cMy wife said to treat myself for my birthday year and go on a trip, and I follow the New Untouchables and others on social media so I thought I\u2019d go here,\u201d he said. Davidson has been a 60s fanatic since he was a university student in the early 1980s. He began dressing up in 60s suits, driving vintage vehicles and throwing events with the guidance of his father. As the internet community of mod-style lovers grew, he began connecting with other people from around the world who share his interest. He said: \u201cI saw a bunch of people I liked and followed online who will be attending so I thought it would be a good opportunity to meet people. \u201cIt\u2019s genuinely fun to be around a lot of people with similar taste to you. In Toronto, we have regular Motown and mod events, but there\u2019s a smaller group of us. But we\u2019re spread out all over the place, so it\u2019s fun to have so many people in the same place for this.\u201d Modstock has attracted mod and 60s fanatics from across generations, with some younger attenders keen to learn more from the older generations. Alexandra Mason, 24, is travelling from Stoke on Trent in Staffordshire to take part in the festivities. This is her first Modstock, although she has been attending mod and 60s events for several years. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see some 60s icons performing because it\u2019s not often you can do it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m especially excited for PP Arnold because she\u2019s always been an inspiration to me as a female musician, and she\u2019s an incredible woman with an amazing life.\u201d Mason will perform at Modstock with her band, The Crystal Teardrop. \u201cWe have an affection for classic artists such as the Beatles and the Kinks alongside West Coast favourites including the Great Society, Love and the Byrds,\u201d she said. They were invited to play the event by Bailey and the organising team,. Mason said: \u201cWe are delighted to be part of Modstock \u2013 music will always be a vital part of the mod scene and we hope we can make our own contribution to making the weekend really special.\u201d",

Sometimes it\u2019s implicit \u2013 in the gentle placement of a magazine in a suburban WH Smith, for example. And sometimes it is absolutely, gravel-in-the-eyes explicit \u2013 as in the opening of pubs but not labour wards during the first Covid-19 lockdown. This oily cultural assumption, which some of the more sharp-eyed among you might have noticed tends to follow seams of gender and class, has been one of my biggest beefs in the past decade. So it is disquieting, I\u2019ll admit, to read a book with whole chapters dedicated to, say, the Hi-Tec squash shoe in white and dark green, the McDonald\u2019s Chicken Big Mac, Football Manager and the Ohto Horizon needle point pen, and to find it funny. At times, brilliant. But that\u2019s what Joel Golby has written and that\u2019s what I thought and that\u2019s what will, I am sure, delight, charm and move his readers. Golby\u2019s eye for detail, scouring wit, speed-skater handling of language and mournful take on modern neuroses is just as hilarious as connoisseurs of his journalism would expect. That the subjects are petty and insignificant is the whole point; it\u2019s while tap dancing along this footpath of trivialities that he stubs his toe on something more substantial, like, say, loneliness, masculinity or grief. The conceit of Four Stars is a memoir presented as a series of reviews. So, for instance, the aforementioned squash shoe gets five stars; violence \u2013 by way of a late\u2011night encounter in Surrey Quays Tesco while looking for a specific brand of American-style mustard \u2013 gets two stars; \u201cBeing Trapped In A Toilet In Spitalfields Market And Like 16 People Watching Me Come Out Once They Finally Got The Door Down\u201d gets zero stars. There is a recurring cast of characters; some real, some contrived. There is Gemma, Golby\u2019s girlfriend, who becomes the subject of a very When Harry Met Sally series of counterintuitive observations, including: \u201cI love that she mopes about the house in a huge hooded dressing gown that stinks and has coffee stains all down it\u201d; or \u201cI love the mad vampiric way she sleeps with her hands clasped\u201d. There is Michael, his considerate, concerned friend. There is also a neanderthal Golby who acts as a literary mechanism for self-reproach and, towards the end of the book, joins an imagined pub conversation between Golby and his late father. Of course, a review of a memoir is a review of a book, not a life. Whether you enjoy Four Stars will have more to do with whether you enjoy Golby\u2019s writing than whether you have also seen \u201cA Frankly Irresistible Offer On M\u00fcller Corners While You Were On The Way To What Is Technically A Party\u201d. And the writing is good. But it is also true that some of the observations, experiences and anecdotes will speak very specifically to a trend-chasing, metropolitan, brand-obsessed hedonist. Is it niche to take an interest in \u00a365 T-shirts, Staropramen, Agaric Fly incense, Westfield Stratford and almond croissants? Not necessarily. Is being relatable the hallmark of a good book? Absolutely not. Does it make me feel self-conscious that I\u2019m giving a book called Four Stars a five-star rating? You bet. \u2022 Four Stars: A Life.

        "body": "Bharat, 62 We\u2019d try to have sex three times in four hours, to make the most of the Premier Inn booking My relationship with Jessica started out as an affair. We met online six years ago via a website for married people who want to cheat. Recently, we both left our spouses and brought our relationship out into the open, which has changed our sex life. Affair sex was always charged, but it was also a bit of a rush: we\u2019d try to have sex three times in four hours to make the most of the hotel booking. Or we\u2019d meet in a National Trust car park and have a five-minute tryst in a quiet coppice. I\u2019d go home with suspicious insect bites all over my bottom. These days, Jessica and I are discovering the joy of sex in a proper bedroom. We do it leisurely, on weekend mornings, and then read each other the papers. I\u2019m in my 60s but I\u2019ve never had this kind of regular, loving, \u201crelationship\u201d sex before. My ex-wife was uninterested in a physical life with me. We got married very young and I\u2019m not sure she ever really fancied me. Before I met Jessica, my unhealthy way of coping was to meet someone online twice a year, shag them for a few weeks then cut it off. I\u2019d spend the next six months trying to resist the website, but I\u2019d always crack. After I left my marriage, I wasn\u2019t sure I was able to commit to Jessica. I didn\u2019t want to repeat my pattern of being the \u201caffair guy\u201d and start cheating on her. She had her doubts, too: we were good at having secret sex, but would we be good at going to Tesco together? Or running a house? Starting out as an affair facilitates a ruthless sort of honesty \u2013 your partner already knows the worst thing you\u2019ve ever done, so it\u2019s easier to say the unsayable. We had a lot of frank conversations about whether we should attempt a real relationship. Love has crept up slowly on us, but that has made our connection deeper. Extreme honesty remains the cornerstone of our partnership. We discuss friends of ours who have had affairs, and regularly ask one another whether all of our needs are being met. So far the answer has been \u201cyes\u201d, but I think we could be truthful about it if the answer were ever \u201cno\u201d. Jessica, 58 I decided to have an affair because I wanted a bit of pleasure that was just for me My ex-husband was very controlling. He eroded my sense of self and bound me to him through fear, influencing what I wore and who I saw. I also found it very difficult to say no to sex with him. My decision to have an affair was an act of rebellion. I mulled it over for months before I activated my online dating profile. I finally pushed the button so I could stake a claim to a bit of pleasure that was just for me. Meeting Bharat was liberating. The sex was passionate, but there was no heavy, painful emotion between us. In bed, I held a part of myself aloof from Bharat, and I enjoyed the sense of detachment, because it was the opposite of how swallowed up I felt by my husband. But sometimes with Bharat I felt as if I was play-acting the part of the \u201csexy mistress\u201d who wore nippleless bras and crotchless knickers. The sex we had in bland hotel rooms was exciting, but the excitement sometimes felt a bit cheap. I left my husband a year after meeting Bharat. The affair helped me end my marriage, because it gave me a taste of autonomy, but I had no intention of converting what I had with Bharat into a serious relationship. When Bharat left his wife, I worried about his life as a serial shagger. Part of what persuaded me to give it a go was his total transparency. He went to therapy, and told me about previous flings in such gory detail that I was convinced he had nothing to hide. The first time he said \u201cI love you\u201d my initial self-protective reaction was to blurt out: \u201cI don\u2019t love you.\u201d I was fearful of losing myself in another relationship, but I did love him. One unexpected consequence of making our relationship official is that the sex has actually got better. I bring my whole self to the bedroom now. It\u2019s more sensuous. I\u2019ve hung up my crotchless knickers, and that\u2019s a relief. Would you and your partner like to share the story, anonymously, of your sex life?",

        "body": "Gaynor Evans spent the Easter of 1972 with her children, Mark, seven, and Joanna, four, and her husband Russell, a lecturer at Swansea University. The family lived in a modern detached four-bed home on the Mumbles coast, where she was pretty content with her lot. She had, after all, just bought a second family car, and most of her spare cash, earned from her part-time job at a nearby hospital, went on fashionable new clothes. At that time, rather as now, velvet trouser suits were in vogue. \u201cI\u2019m really quite happy about all my life,\u201d she said then, reflecting on all the cleaning and cooking that faced her each week. \u201cI got married because it was the thing my mother wanted me to do. It didn\u2019t enter my head to do otherwise. I don\u2019t feel a drudge. I did quite well out of it, actually.\u201d Something that did mark Evans out from her neighbours, aside from her \u201ctrendy\u201d outfits, was her use of garlic in the kitchen. Her friends found the smell odd. But she was never one for throwing dinner parties. Instead, it was the discotheque that drew her at weekends. There, she and Russell danced \u201cTop of the Pops-style\u201d until the early hours. We know all this detail about Evans, now 86, as she was picked out that April, more than five decades ago, as the subject of The Way We Live Now, a series of interviews with \u201cordinary\u201d women in the Observer\u2019s feature section. A portrait of her through her iron gate was taken by the late, great Jane Bown and captioned \u201cGaynor Evans is happy\u201d. This photograph presided over a newspaper page crammed with leisure and style advertisements. One promoted the \u201clong and short\u201d frocks available at Plum of Chelsea while others listed attractions included the coming summer\u2019s 26th Edinburgh international festival and West End preview tickets for new \u201cepic musical\u201d Gone with the Wind. Prompted by International Women\u2019s Day earlier this month, Evans got in touch again with an update on her life, motivated by a desire to remind readers of the very different challenges facing women then. Time has added perspective since that visit from Bown and the Welsh journalist Mavis Nicholson, who went on to become a well-known television interviewer. But some things remain true about her life, Evans says: \u201cI do have aches and pains and a few things wrong with me, but as long as my mind is active, I\u2019m still quite happy.\u201d Her husband, by then a professor, died 18 years ago at 68, but she has her two children, two grandchildren, Rebecca and Thomas, and now two great grandchildren, Amelia, two-and-a-half, and five-month-old baby Sophia. She also has her rescue dog, a whippet called Louis: \u201cI spend a lot of time on my own, apart from Louis, and he spends his life humping my cushions.\u201d Evans\u2019s disco days may be long gone, but she is active. \u201cI love to walk my dog on the beach as much as I can. I\u2019m lucky I can do that. And I\u2019m not lonely because I have lots of friends,\u201d she said. On Easter Sunday, she will be enjoying lunch with her family at the Langland Bay Golf Club (also a favourite of local celebrity Catherine Zeta-Jones when she visits, notes Evans). \u201cI play bridge there three times a week. I recommend it. It helps me forget my problems.\u201d To celebrate her birthday next month she is booked to see Jesus Christ Superstar in Swansea. The city, though, is not what it was, she regrets: \u201cI don\u2019t even shop there any more. I even used to go up to London to shop at Che Guevara back then, but now I order most of my clothes from catalogues. I still like clothes, and I went to a fashion show last Tuesday, in fact.\u201d Not a fan of watching telly in the 1970s, Evans now enjoys EastEnders and Netflix true crime series. Her opinion on what was then known as \u201ca deep freeze\u201d has also changed: \u201cI did get a freezer in the end.\u201d She had been wary, suspecting it was one mod con that would require too much domestic forward planning. \u201cI don\u2019t care what else I haven\u2019t got, as long as I have my automatic washing machine,\u201d she said in 1972. What really has altered is Evans\u2019s attitude to work. \u201cI married when I was 21, and if I could go back, I would not do that so young. I worked part-time to help get my husband through his science and mathsdegrees and his doctorate. When I was interviewed by Mavis, I was doing occupational therapy at the hospital. I wasn\u2019t a receptionist, like she said. I enjoyed getting people ready to leave, and I did it for 10 years. It\u2019s what I\u2019d have done if I\u2019d had my own career. Before that, I had an office job at the Halifax, which I hated. Later, after the hospital, I ran an antique and bric-a-brac shop, Collections, for another 10 years. \u201cMy daughter worked there with me on a youth training scheme.\u201d Evans\u2019s son followed his father into academia, lecturing in engineering at Swansea University. But it is Evans\u2019s memories of her impoverished wartime childhood that have come back with force. \u201cI would not be the person I am if it wasn\u2019t for my wonderful parents, Tom and Nelly. He was away in the army and she was in the land army, doing lots of jobs; picking mushrooms and blackberries in the Gower countryside. \u201cIt was a hard life, and difficult if you moved in because people thought you were taking their work. We became homeless and had to squat, living in half a hut with the young family of a trawlerman. He would come home with fish and my mum would cook it for the whole camp. Those are things I don\u2019t like to remember. There was a time a man got in the bedroom window, and I had to give evidence in court afterwards for my mum. It was very hard indeed. I don\u2019t think people now understand what it was like for a woman alone with children in the war: what they had to do.\u201d Following Russell\u2019s death in 2006, Evans downsized to a nearby bungalow. \u201cI wanted to stay close to neighbours I\u2019ve known for so long. And I\u2019d very much like to stay in my bungalow and have someone come in to help me if I need it.\u201d A Welsh nationalist voter at the time of the Observer interview, Evans now describes herself as Labour: \u201cI don\u2019t speak Welsh and neither do my kids, and I don\u2019t particularly regret that.\u201d She is not a fan of Brexit and does not like the government\u2019s Rwanda plan for immigrants: \u201cTruly, I think people should get by with helping each other.\u201d Her advice for life is \u201cto face your demons\u201d, but says it is having a sense of humour that got her through: \u201cAnd the best landmarks of my life have been my grandchildren, who I was very hands-on with, and, of course, now my great-grandchildren.\u201d \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 1 April 2024 because an earlier version incorrectly referred to 1972 as the year of marriage of Gaynor Evans.",

        "body": "This month, the Singapore Airlines frequent flyer program, KrisFlyer, made a play for Australian customers with its \u201cKris+ Miles\u201d offering. It meansmembers in Sydney and Melbourne are now able to earn by tapping their rewards app in store at select merchants (very select merchants \u2013 there are only 34 Kris+ partners in the country). The move theoretically makes it easier to earn points \u2013 and, perhaps more interestingly, represents an airline vying to become a new carrier-of-choice. Frequent flyer programs are a competitive space. Done right, they can snag consumers free flights and upgrades \u2013 a welcome perk, especially in the current economy. But the real winners are, of course, the airlines themselves. These programs are highly profitable. Airlines can sell points in bulk to banks and retail partners (who, in turn, can use them to lure in new customers with things such as bonus points offers on credit cards). They are excellent marketing tools that encourage customer loyalty. And they\u2019re a great way to harvest marketers\u2019 most valuable resource: our data. So what is the best frequent flyer program open to Australians now? How can you earn points without going anywhere? And given they\u2019re likely tracking our every move, is being a member truly worth it? We asked some experts. Which is the best frequent flyer program for Australians? KrisFlyer may be trying to lure Australian flyers but experts say it\u2019s best suited to those who regularly travel in and out of Singapore, or anyone keen to get a foot into Star Alliance, the global airline alliance it\u2019s a member of \u2013 which Australians haven\u2019t had easy access to since the days of Ansett. For the rest of us, it\u2019s probably not about to become a major player. \u201cRealistically, the two real contenders come down to being a Qantas frequent flyer and [Virgin Australia\u2019s program] Velocity,\u201d Kidman says. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones to give serious consideration to.\u201d That\u2019s because Qantas and Virgin are the airlines you\u2019ll be flying domestically, who have the vast majority of local credit card partnerships, and who allow you to earn points with your supermarket shop \u2013 which keeps your balance active when you\u2019re on the ground (points can expire with as little as 18 months of account inactivity). Locally, there is a new contender in regional carrier Rex Airlines, which this month announced its own frequent flyer program \u2013 though it\u2019s still in its very early days and hasn\u2019t yet announced any credit card partners, or revealed information on how to redeem flights. So, for now, which out of Qantas and Velocity is the better program? \u201cI think Qantas because you just have more redemption options, because they find more places locally, and they have more partnerships globally,\u201d says Kidman. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of variables to consider but, at a high level, that\u2019s how I would sum it up.\u201d A key factor in Qantas\u2019s favour is its membership in the OneWorld alliance. That means you can earn points \u2013 or access rewards flights \u2013 on airlines such as Cathay Pacific, Qatar and British Airways. Upper-level members of Qantas Frequent Flyer can reliably access perks such as lounge access across those partner airlines too. Velocity, on the other hand, is not part of an airline alliance \u2013 but has one-on-one partnerships with airlines such as Etihad, United and Singapore Airlines. \u201cSo what you find sometimes it\u2019s a bit disjointed in terms of benefits,\u201d says Daniel Sciberras, from the frequent flyer-focused website PointsHacks. He says some airline partners might give you lounge access but not priority boarding, while for others the benefits may be reversed. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup While Virgin does have \u201ca lot of good partnerships\u201d, Sciberras says they don\u2019t operate their own long-haul international flights, which means \u201cthey have no direct control, really, for any long-haul reward redemptions \u2013 they\u2019re always relying on availability of partners\u201d. And some airlines will give their own frequent flyer program members preference when it comes to handing out free seats. In addition to that large range of international routes, Qantas also has a bigger domestic network than Virgin, which again means more opportunities to earn and redeem points. You may also rack up points faster flying Qantas because they allot points based on the distance you fly, while Virgin points are based on ticket prices. \u201cThe trade-off for a lot of people is that the Qantas fares are higher in the first place,\u201d says Kidman. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that, on any given domestic route, if you\u2019re looking at more than a week in advance you\u2019ll find the Virgin flights a bit cheaper. So for some people, they favour Virgin because that\u2019s the airline they want to fly with.\u201d Of course, if you live outside the major cities, your ability to fly Virgin at all may be very slight \u2013 meaning Velocity isn\u2019t really an option. Ultimately, the decision may come down to which airline (and which partners) you\u2019re most likely to fly. You can also join multiple local programs \u2013 though it probably makes more sense to focus your efforts on one. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing stopping you being in both of them and just seeing what you mount up,\u201d Kidman says. \u201cBut the reality is, if you want to build the points total, you\u2019re better off picking one scheme.\u201d How can you earn points if you\u2019re not flying? \u201cMost of the points earned from the Qantas Frequent Flyer program aren\u2019t from flying. They\u2019re from what\u2019s known as on-the-ground transactions,\u201d says Sciberras. Whether you\u2019re with Qantas or Velocity, the fastest way to earn on the ground is through savvy credit card use. Kidman suggests \u201ctargeting [one scheme], getting a credit card that matches it, using your supermarket, and flying [your scheme of choice] when you can.\u201d But that advice comes with a big red asterisk. \u201cNever get a credit card for the points if you\u2019re not going to pay it off in full,\u201d says Sciberras. This is because point-accruing credit cards charge high interest rates, and the cost of paying those far outweighs any points-related benefit. If you\u2019re confident in your ability to pay off your card in full each month, credit cards that accrue Qantas or Velocity points with every dollar spent will fast-track your accumulation. Sciberras says to look for cards that offer a sign-up bonus of six figures \u2013 100,000 points or above. Next, consider how many points you earn per dollar spent. You may also want to look at spending caps, as many cards will only offer the best earning rates up to a monthly limit. And it\u2019s worth considering that American Express cards, which often offer better sign-up bonuses and earn rates, aren\u2019t as widely accepted as Visa or Mastercard. But point-accumulation needs to be weighed against the cost of owning a credit card \u2013 bigger sign-up bonuses tend to come on cards with higher annual fees. You should also consider whether you can realistically achieve the minimum spend required to earn bonus points, which is typically between $3,000 and $6,000 in the first three months. (And when it comes to Qantas versus Velocity, it\u2019s also worth noting that Velocity cards often \u2013 but not always \u2013 have lower annual fees and easier-to-achieve sign-up bonuses). The other big way to earn points on the ground is your grocery shop \u2013 you can earn Qantas points shopping at Woolworths (via their Everyday Rewards card) and Velocity points at the register at Coles (through FlyBuys). There\u2019s a not-insignificant number of points on offer at the till \u2013 Kidman says he\u2019s managed to earn over 42,000 Qantas points doing his groceries this year. You can also earn points by buying a certain car, health or travel insurance policies, or shopping at particular outlets \u2013 7-Eleven, for instance, offers customers Velocity points every time they spend. And if you download its Wellbeing app, Qantas will give customers a (very small) number of points for things such as getting enough steps and sleep every day. Are they all just harvesting your data? The big caveat to all frequent flyer programs is that there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch \u2013 memberships come at the cost of sharing personal data. Katharine Kemp, an associate professor at UNSW who researches data privacy, says that while some consumers might think of frequent flyer programs as a reward for loyalty, \u201cin fact most of these schemes really are data businesses that are collecting a vast array of information and using that to provide \u2018insights\u2019 to other firms\u201d. It\u2019s not just travel bookings, spending habits and grocery orders that frequent flyer schemes get access to. \u201cIn addition to that, a lot of these schemes actually go behind consumers\u2019 backs, and approach third parties to find out further information about them,\u201d Kemp says. As well as being used to simply sell you more stuff, that \u201cwide range of information about you\u201d can be used to determine the content you see online, exclude you from certain offers, force you to pay more for certain products, or indicate that you are \u201ctoo great a risk in the eyes of some companies for certain services,\u201d Kemp says. Unfortunately, that behind-your-back data sharing means being selective with where we link our points (for instance, collecting them only through our flying and not our groceries) might not help. Given these programs don\u2019t tell consumers exactly how data is being used and retained, it is impossible to know whether one program is more data-safe than another. Nor can Australians simply opt out of data collection. \u201cIf you are an EU or Swiss resident, you can object to being profiled by a frequent flyer scheme. But if you\u2019re an Australian consumer, you don\u2019t have any right to object,\u201d Kemp says. \u201cOur privacy laws are not as strong.\u201d Whether or not you\u2019re happy to join a frequent flyer program anyway is a personal choice. \u201cI don\u2019t like to tell people what to do,\u201d Kemp says. \u201cBut I am not part of any of these programs myself. Because in my view, for myself, I don\u2019t think the risk is worth it.\u201d",

        "body": "Here\u2019s a challenge for you, what do these three things have in common: a cornflower blue hat worn by Catherine, Princess of Wales, sun drenched swimming pools in California and the most celebrated unmade bed on the planet? All are manifestations of the creative minds of some of the RCA\u2019s most venerated alumni. From Tracey Emin\u2019s crumpled mattress to David Hockney\u2019s alluring American skylines to Philip Treacy\u2019s regal headwear, these are the seismic impacts that just three of the RCA\u2019s former students have had on the worlds of art and design. Named this year as the best institution in the world for art and design for the ninth year running by the QS World University Rankings by Subject (which compares 15,000 university programmes at more than 1,500 universities in 93 countries), there are myriad attractions to studying a postgraduate course at the RCA. But don\u2019t take our word for it \u2013 look at what three students have to say about the reasons they\u2019d recommend it to others \u2026 Collaboration With more than 80 nationalities represented in its student body, a core part of the experience of studying at the RCA is learning from fellow students with a variety of cultures and practices. \u201cI have found that everyone is so generous with sharing their knowledge and skills,\u201d says Sophie Longwill, who is studying for an MA in ceramics and glass. \u201cWe learn so much from each other and it is lovely to be able to bounce ideas and troubleshoot together.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment illustrated by Myles Ikenna Igwebuike, currently studying towards a design products MA. \u201cNot long ago, I ran into this awesome painter, Joey, from Lebanon. I happened to be holding this object I\u2019d just created in the metal workshop. We got to talking, and I couldn\u2019t resist asking him: \u2018What does this make you feel?\u2019 He got very emotional and shared how my piece brought back memories of destruction and sadness during the Beirut explosion in 2020,\u201d says Igwebuike. \u201cThis moment was such a game-changer for me at the RCA. Everything just shifted from there, and we ended up collaborating on an installation. It was showcased at an RCA event, and over 400 people showed up!\u201d Technical services and facilities An array of qualified technicians and world class facilities help creatives realise their visions and develop their skills, says Taylor Cheng, who recently moved from Hong Kong to study towards the arts and humanities MFA (master of fine arts) at the RCA. She enthuses in particular about the librarians and her EAP (English for Academic Purposes programme) tutor. \u2018\u2018The library induction wasn\u2019t just about showing me how to use research tools. It also opened my mind up to ways of thinking and visualising my research. And the EAP workshop wasn\u2019t just about improving our English skills. It taught us the thinking behind communicating our creative practices and ideas.\u201d Longwill is currently working with the RCA\u2019s tech gurus to hone her glassblowing skills on campus. \u201cI\u2019m still very much a beginner in terms of skill,\u201d she says. \u201cYet the technicians are so encouraging, they really inspire confidence. I also have been learning how to weld for the first time and I can\u2019t wait to try more new things with all the amazing resources here.\u201d Scholarships Scholarships at the RCA are geared towards ensuring those from under-represented backgrounds and those requiring financial assistance are able to realise their potential. Longwill is a recipient of the M\u00e4rit Rausing scholarship, which she believes has been life changing. \u201cThere is no way I could have afforded to come here without it,\u201d she says. \u201cI have dreamed of coming to the RCA for so long. Years ago I helped make a wishing tree art installation at a music festival. I wrote \u2018to study at the RCA\u2019 for my wish and tied it to the tree \u2013 I guess it worked! \u201cThe M\u00e4rit Rausing Scholarships are the most generous scholarships available at RCA and are worth \u00a335,000. I pinch myself every day because I still can\u2019t quite believe it. It really is a dream come true.\u201d Alumni success The RCA can open doors to careers in the creative and cultural industries, as its glittering alumni and recent graduate successes demonstrate. As well as inspiring the current crop of postgraduate students, the network of alumni creatives is something students become very much a part of. \u201cI\u2019ve got some major love for [designer] Tord Boontje and [artist and writer] Victor Burgin, who are legends in their field,\u201d says Igwebuike. \u201cSpeaking of inspiration, there\u2019s an environmental artist and architect called Yussef Agbo-Ola who also studied at the RCA. Their environmental work has had a massive impact on my own practice.\u201d Location, location, location The RCA\u2019s trio of London locations take in the historic surroundings of Kensington, the future-thinking hub of White City and the cultural quarter in Battersea \u2013 putting students on the doorstep of some of the UK\u2019s top cultural institutions, from Tate Britain to the Serpentine Gallery and the V&amp;A. It makes for an inspirational backdrop to study, according to Longwill. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great location being close to all the museums, I can\u2019t resist popping into the V&amp;A whenever I\u2019m near it, as well as the mineralogy collection at the Natural History Museum. I\u2019m still getting to know my way around London but being a part of the RCA is like having a magic key, it\u2019s so well known and renowned for talent and a high standard of artistry.\u201d From animation and architecture to fashion and fine arts, find out more about how you could unleash your creative passion and boost your career at the Royal College of Art",

        "body": "\u2018In Saltburn, being rich makes you remarkable, fascinating and deeply sexy\u2019 Charlotte Higgins Forget class war. Saltburn is interested in class only in order to portray grand English people with large houses as gorgeously twisted and sinisterly attractive, the dazzling flame to which a humble moth (albeit a moth with plenty of destructive powers) must inevitably be drawn. Though being rich and beautiful could hardly be said to make you happy or decent in Saltburn\u2019s world, it absolutely makes you remarkable, fascinating and deeply sexy. There are two virtuous, non-grand characters in Emerald Fennell\u2019s movie, and you definitely wouldn\u2019t want to go to a party thrown by them. But don\u2019t pretend: of course you want to go to a party in which Richard E Grant is in fancy dress and the midsummer gardens are lit up with gorgeous lights and there\u2019s a handsome man roaming about wearing stag horns. Saltburn, as an artwork, absolutely loves its own Bridesheady-ness, and even goes so far as to mention Waugh by name in its opening scenes. But Brideshead Revisited was written by an author capable of rendering (longingly as well as satirically) the precise contours of grandeur precisely because he wasn\u2019t born to it. Saltburn\u2019s underlying perspective \u2013 despite the focalisation through its not-grand narrator \u2013 is that of the careless, insouciant English upper classes. I think this is a way of saying that Saltburn could only have been written by a very posh British person. A native speaker from the land of the grand. Saltburn is objectionable, I suppose, in that and several other ways I could enumerate \u2013 but it is also terribly enjoyable. Emerald Fennell\u2019s sheer pleasure in things and objects and bodies is seductive: drops of sweat on the neck of a lovely young man, a Bernard Palissy dish, a sheet of golden hair let loose and just barely dipping into a lily pond on a hot English day, even the spatter of vomit on a wall after an overindulgent party. She clearly loves invoking desire and disgust. Saltburn contains what in my various WhatsApp discussions on this film have simply become known as \u201cthe scenes\u201d \u2013 striking moments in which splendidly over-the-top, possibly titillating and definitely squirm-making events occur. There\u2019s been a certain amount of debate about whether \u201cthe scenes\u201d are necessary to the unfolding plot or are otiose shockers. But the film is unimaginable without them because it enjoys their outrageousness so lustily. At the screening I attended, \u201cthe scenes\u201d involved the whole cinema collapsing into communal giggles. There\u2019s a lot going on in the world: get your giggles where you can. The film regards the entire tradition of English country house gothic as something like an enormous dressing-up box to be dived into with squealing pleasure. \u201cLook, look!\u201d it seems to say. \u201cHere is Daphne Du Maurier! Here is MR James! Here is Emily Bront\u00eb!\u201d There\u2019s nothing remotely subtle about this. For subtlety and delicacy in this territory, please see Joanna Hogg\u2019s The Eternal Daughter, a very different beast, though, also involving upper-class people\u2019s difficult relations in and with enormous country houses. With a kind of over-the-top, indiscriminate lavishness, Fennell has sprinkled her story with references to Kubrick (Barry Lyndonesque candlelit dinners, quotations from The Shining) and she skates fearlessly and perilously between genres, crashing into LP Hartley then ricocheting off Kind Hearts and Coronets. It\u2019s all tremendously silly. It\u2019s also tremendous \u2013 if faintly grubby \u2013 fun. \u2018I\u2019ve never wanted to be fantastically rich. I do now\u2019 Rupert Neate I never wanted to go to an Oxbridge college until I saw Saltburn. Despite reporting on the lives of the world\u2019s super-wealthy for the past seven years, I\u2019ve never really wanted to be fantastically rich. After watching Saltburn I really, really want to be. She makes both Oxford and wealth look ridiculously, fabulously fun. Despite their vast fortunes, the uber-rich people I\u2019ve met never seemed very happy. Worry about keeping their fortune safe \u2013 and away from the taxman \u2013 has led many of them to decamp from say Chelsea, South Kensington or the Upper West Side to distinctly more boring places like Monaco, Liechtenstein or St Lucia. Less fun, but crucial, there are little or no taxes of any kind (except VAT). The rich family in Saltburn don\u2019t live in a tax haven but a vast stately home somewhere in the English countryside. The location in the movie is never really made clear, but it was filmed at Drayton House in Northamptonshire, a 127-room grade-I listed mansion. It dates back to the 1300s and has been owned by the Stopford Sackville family since the 1770s. Forget Jacob Elordi, Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike and Carey Mulligan. Yes, all of the cast are beautiful, but by far the hottest star of this film is Drayton House. It is stunning, and captured beautifully with more lingering shots concentrating on its grand staircases and vast square pond than on the actors (I didn\u2019t count, so feel free to correct me). Immediately on leaving the cinema, I Googled \u201cSaltburn film house location open day\u201d. Not \u201cwas that last scene really him\u201d, as my friend did. My search result revealed you can visit Drayton House on Wednesdays between Easter and September. I have already booked Wednesday 3 April off work \u2013 see you there. All of the characters feel authentically rich: old money rich mixed with trying to appear leftwing and stay connected with the modern world. When Felix Catton (Elordi) takes his new \u2013 much less rich friend \u2013 Oliver Quick (Keoghan) home to Saltburn for the holidays, we meet Sir James (Richard E Grant). Head of the family and Felix\u2019s dad, we immediately know which type of rich family the Cattons are from the state of Grant\u2019s hair. There may be 127 rooms in Drayton House, but a huge chunk of the film takes place in just one of them: a tattily furnished TV room that you could imagine the producers of Gogglebox falling over themselves to use. It is authentically shabby, and Grant is authentically aloof. The film could also be an advert for Oxford. Again, it looks beautiful, and fun. The poorer students, like Oliver, are treated disparagingly by the rich ones who appear to vastly outnumber them despite official stats showing that by the early 00s \u2013 when the film was set \u2013 there were more state school educated students at Oxford than private school ones. The film has been criticised for this. But to me that feels like an authentic depiction of reality that should be brought to wider public attention not sanitised out for fear of insulting people. And Oliver definitely has the last laugh over the wealthy characters. Trepidation of entering a society dominated by rich posh people was why I didn\u2019t want to go to Oxford or Cambridge. But if I\u2019d known that with a bit of guile a comprehensive kid like Oliver or I (yes I know my name is Rupert but I\u2019m not posh, honest) could use it to infiltrate the rich and take their fortunes, I might have reconsidered my Ucas choices. \u2018Emerald Fennell despises the middle classes\u2019 Daniel Lavelle Social class, what it is and where I fit into it, is something I have torn my hair out over my entire life. My working-class grandparents ascended the social ladder when they became schoolteachers; mum was educated at a posh prep school where my grandad taught; and my dad is a lawyer and a part-time judge. All of these things put me firmly in the middle-class category. But I spent my early years in poverty and my teens in care; I lived on council estates in the most deprived areas in the country and have been skint for most of my adulthood. All of these things would earn me a working-class badge. So, I\u2019m in class limbo, fitting in with everyone and no one at the same time. While Saltburn made me even more confused about class, I am sure about one thing: writer-director Emerald Fennell despises the middle classes. Oliver is a first-year fresher at Oxford. He befriends Felix , a gregarious, pretty young thing from the landed gentry, and worms his way into his inner circle after spinning him a sob story. Oliver is firmly middle class but pretends to be a working-class boy from Merseyside. Much like the rest of the characters Fennel created for this ensemble, Oliver paints himself as a caricature: a smart, shy lad from a broken drug-addled, dysfunctional family \u2013 that\u2019s the proles for you. Oliver tells Felix that his dad died, which buys him a ticket to Felix\u2019s ancestral estate for the summer hols. The upper classes are just as wafer-thin as the street urchin Oliver created for himself. The plummy coterie in this film have highfalutin titles, live in manors with doting servants and are either horrific snobs like antagonist Farleigh Start (Archie Madekwe) or patronisingly kind like Felix. When Oliver arrives at Felix\u2019s palatial home for the summer, these caricatures become supercharged. Lady Elspeth (Rosamund Pike) is so vacuous that she doesn\u2019t know where Liverpool is. \u201cIs it by the sea?\u201d she asks Oliver when they meet. Oliver\u2019s ruse goes up in flames when Felix decides to drive him back to Liverpool to reconcile with his bereaved drunken mother, only to discover he\u2019s bourgeoisie incarnate: a semi-detached, tidy lawn, tacky art middler. Beige. Being beige turns out to be Oliver\u2019s biggest mistake. When Felix thought little \u201cOllie\u201d was a chubby-cheeked ne\u2019er-do-well, he was happy to have him as a pet. But the middle classes are nobody and everybody. Not poor or rich enough to have an identity, and, in Oliver\u2019s case, a personality. \u2018It nails the intoxicating but toxic hedonism of noughties culture\u2019 Jess Cartner-Morley Saltburn is a mischievous film, with a taste for the delicious detail and a gimlet eye for everyday cruelties. It skewers the foibles of the English upper class: their love of fancy dress and of having baths, of dressing gowns and picnics and talking about their schooldays. It pokes fun at the time warped posho mindset in which everyone adopts 18th-century manners around the breakfast table even though they were murdering Flo Rida\u2019s Low on the karaoke after dinner and dropping pills at dawn to Time to Pretend by MGMT just a couple of hours ago. The unspoken rules and hidden bear traps that lie in wait for those who dare step out of their lane are laid out in graphic detail. First year undergraduate Oliver arrives at Oxford wearing a striped college scarf \u2013 an accessory he imagines will make him fit in. It is painful to see, because the audience can see immediately will do quite the opposite, marking him out as a try-hard in a milieu where entitlement comes with a brittle edge which is used savagely against outsiders. There is an excruciating scene in which Oliver is shamed for the too-long sleeves of his rented tux. This is beautifully observed by Fennell, who as the Marlborough-educated daughter of a society jeweller is herself a product of what she calls \u201cgrotesque privilege\u201d. A certain type of posh Englishman will talk for hours, if you let him, about the correct relative measurement of shirt and jacket sleeve. But Saltburn is not really about class, at least not in the straightforward way that the trailer suggests. Most of the action is set in 2006 and 2007, and the film nails the intoxicating but toxic hedonism of noughties culture. The girls wear sequined party dresses from the glory days of TopShop and feather boas, and the boys pop the collars of their rugby shirts and sport Livestrong rubber bracelets \u2013 relics from a time when Lance Armstrong was a hero. Rosamund Pike steals the show as society beauty Elspeth, a perennial debutante who seems faintly surprised to find herself living in the 21st century. Very slender, with cheekbones as cut glass as her accent, Elspeth captures the reckless skinny-worship of the era when she jokingly dismisses her daughter\u2019s eating disorder as \u201cfingers for pudding\u201d. It takes a few decades for the fashion of an era to mellow into palatable nostalgia. The 00s are still too close to comfort for that. There are some beautiful clothes in Saltburn \u2013 I spotted pieces from the Christopher Kane and Alexander McQueen catwalk collections of that time \u2013 but the film deliberately jumbles high-end style references of the era (Kate Moss, Amy Winehouse, Sienna Miller, Lily Allen, a dash of Daphne Guinness and Isabella Blow) with naff ones (some of the partygoers are straight out of the Prince Harry and Chelsy Davy sartorial playbook). As a film, it is about as comfortable as a Miss Selfridge corset dress and a cheap pair of platform heels. But \u2013 just like with the dress and the heels \u2013 it\u2019s worth it, for a fun night, right? \u2018Saltburn\u2019s purpose is to make in-jokes about how middle class people don\u2019t know how to behave in country houses\u2019 Sirin Kale I watched Saltburn all the way through to the end and wasn\u2019t bored, which is more than I can say for most films. It looks gorgeous. Rosamund Pike is excellent. In our age of endlessly cannibalised intellectual property, watching a film that wasn\u2019t bastardised from a hit podcast or bestselling novel was refreshing. But the more I started to think about the film, the more I grew irritated. My main gripe with Saltburn, and the one I keep circling back to is: what is the point of it? I imagine Emerald Fennell, its writer, director, and producer, would say it\u2019s satire, specifically class satire. OK. That explains the film\u2019s thin characterisation, and the way it seems archly delighted with its own performative transgression: at various points, characters slurp each other\u2019s semeny bathwater, perform oral sex on menstruating women, and \u2013 it gives me no pleasure to write this \u2013 have sex with a freshly filled grave. So is the satirical point that Fennell is trying to make that being upper class is brilliant, but that the upper classes should stop exposing their soft white bellies to the predatory arrivistes who would steal the family seat? Or is the point that, actually, we should root for middle-class underdogs in their murderous quest to become upper class? If so, why are all the upper-class people we see on screen so awful? Who\u2019d want to surround themselves with those people? In truth, I don\u2019t know what the point of Saltburn is, other than to make in-jokes about how middle-class people don\u2019t know how to behave in country houses, jokes that feel a little unkind when you consider Fennell\u2019s own privileged background and upbringing. Emerald Fennell is an Oxford University English literature graduate, so she\u2019ll understand the reference I\u2019m about to make: in Jonathan Swift\u2019s 1729 satirical essay A Modest Proposal, Swift suggests that the Irish poor sell their babies to be cooked and eaten by wealthy ladies and gentlemen as a way of ameliorating their economic situation. It\u2019s appalling, but there\u2019s a deeper meaning: Swift uses satire to underscore the heartlessness of British policy towards the Irish. But without a purpose, satire is just pointless provocation. A recurrent visual gag in the film is that the characters lie about all day reading Harry Potter, despite having a library full of first editions at their disposal. At least Harry Potter has a deeper meaning: how friends can become your chosen family, and the importance of standing up for what\u2019s right. Saltburn doesn\u2019t know the point it wants to make, only that it enjoys shocking people. I\u2019ll forgive any amount of semen-clagged bathwater and graveside ejaculate if there\u2019s a point to it. But I won\u2019t forgive that. \u2018Scratch at the surface and the gilding begins to chip off like a tourist-shop trinket\u2019 Gwilym Mumford Avoid peering too closely at Saltburn, Emerald Fennell\u2019s soapy tale of haves and very-much-wants, and you could easily mistake it for a good film. From a distance it resembles the \u201cgourmet cheeseburger\u201d model Netflix uses for its own films and shows \u2013 something both moreishly delicious and reassuringly well made. Its high-low culture touchstones \u2013 Waugh meets Highsmith meets HBO\u2019s Euphoria \u2013 are on point. It looks a treat too, with cinematographer Linus Sandgren lending a lurid, eye-popping gloss to old money refinement. Its performers, particularly Rosamund Pike, have a great time feasting on its ripe dialogue. Granted, it\u2019s way too long \u2013 did we really need quite that many minutes of Barry Keoghan slurping milky bathwater, or so many shots of coke whizzing up nostrils in slo-mo to the strains of Time to Pretend? \u2013 but for the most part it zips along amiably enough, always making sure to deliver a jolt of edginess whenever the plot starts to sag. So what\u2019s the problem? For me, the doubts about Saltburn begin the moment I filed out of the cinema, the serotonin rush of its 00s soundtrack wore off, and I started to actually think about the carnival of depravity I just witnessed. What was the film actually trying to say about the assortment of themes \u2013 wealth, class, lust, sexuality, family and (extremely briefly and unsatisfyingly) race \u2013 it stuffed into its Birkin bag? Did any of its many rug pulls make a lick of sense? Scratch at the surface and the gilding begins to chip off like a tourist-shop trinket. It\u2019s hard to discuss Saltburn\u2019s biggest missteps without getting into heavy spoiler territory. But anyone who has already seen the film will have surely stumbled over the journey of Keoghan\u2019s lower-orders striver Oliver into Tom Ripley-ish mendacious mastermind, which seems both heavily telegraphed and puzzlingly opaque. Does Oliver want to ingratiate himself into the upper orders or destroy them? Is he driven by lust, resentment or just garden-variety psychopathy? Neither he \u2013 nor the film \u2013 really seems to know. The film\u2019s big reveal is accompanied by a moustache-twirling montage outlining exactly how it was done that seems not only unnecessary \u2013 we\u2019d all figured it out ourselves at least 20 minutes before \u2013 but also accidentally hovers a magnifying glass over some gaping plot holes. You\u2019d think Fennell, jewellery-empire scion that she is, might be on steadier ground with the film\u2019s poshos, but that isn\u2019t the case. Saltburn can\u2019t decide whether its titular pile\u2019s inhabitants are likeably louche degenerates, gilded-cage songbirds or careless Tom and Daisy Buchanans. Ultimately you come out of the film feeling a little sorry for them \u2013 their largesse having been repaid with cruelty \u2013 which leaves Saltburn as that rare class-war drama that sides with the haves over the have-nots. Still, what Saltburn lacks in narrative and thematic coherence, it makes up for in pure shock value. Every 20 minutes, like clockwork, there\u2019s some new transgression to gawp at. But even those have diminishing returns: by the time of the film\u2019s final outrage, a gleeful punchline Fennell has been waiting the past two and a bit hours to deliver, you respond with a wearied shrug, having had more than your fill of depravity. That\u2019s the problem with gourmet cheeseburgers \u2013 eat too many of them and you\u2019ll probably just end up feeling a bit sick.",

        "body": "Lunching on a tuna sandwich in the central market of Volendam, a picturesque fishing port north of Amsterdam, Gerald, 24, was lucid about his choice in last week\u2019s Dutch election. \u201cI voted for Wilders, and many of my friends did too,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live with my parents for ever. I want my own home, and to be able to provide for my family later on. Wilders wants to figure out the housing crisis, and make our healthcare better. Those are the most important topics for me.\u201d If everyone who voted in the election had been aged under 35, Geert Wilders, the far-right populist whose Party for Freedom (PVV) shocked Europe by winning the most parliamentary seats, would have won even more. In last year\u2019s French presidential runoff, Marine Le Pen won 39% of votes from people aged 18-24 and 49% of those aged 25-34. Before Italy\u2019s election in September last year, Giorgia Meloni\u2019s Brothers of Italy was the largest party among under-35s, on 22%. Across the continent, the image of the radical-right voter \u2013 typically white, male, non-graduate and, above all, old \u2013 is changing, and studies suggest that in several countries, support for the far right is growing fastest among younger voters. Several factors may explain the phenomenon, analysts say. \u201cWe really should be careful about assuming a cultural or ideological alignment between young voters and the far right,\u201d said Catherine de Vries, a political scientist at Italy\u2019s Bocconi university. \u201cWe know in many countries young people are more pro-immigration than older voters. They have not become xenophobic. But their lives are more precarious. These are often votes for what in this Dutch election was called \u2018livelihood security\u2019.\u201d The Dutch word bestaanszekerheid translates roughly as an existence with a sufficient and predictable income, a satisfactory home, adequate access to education and healthcare, and a cushion against unexpected eventualities. Issues such as housing, overcrowded classes and struggling hospitals were key to the youth vote, De Vries said. \u201cWilders may want \u2018Dutch people first\u2019 but he promises to fix these things,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government parties imposed austerity.\u201d In Volendam, where the PVV won 42.9% of the vote, that was Gerald\u2019s point. \u201cYounger people, the woke ones from the big cities, care about the climate and gender stuff but they are ignoring the real problems that we have here and now,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not a racist because I voted for Wilders. It frustrates me that migrants receive more help from the government than Dutch people \u2013 but I\u2019m not against Islam; I don\u2019t want mosques closed. I just think we need to control immigration better.\u201d Koen, 19, a student in Amsterdam, echoed that view. \u201cI still live with my parents \u2013 I can\u2019t afford a room in Amsterdam,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to commute every day. Wilders wants to give housing to people who are from here \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s strange.\u201d Koen, too, said he did not believe Wilders would go through with his extreme anti-Islam pledges: closing mosques, banning headscarves and outlawing the Qur\u2019an. \u201cI thought Wilders was the best in the debates. He made a lot of sense,\u201d he said. Far-right parties are not the preferred option \u2013 or even second choice \u2013 for younger voters everywhere in Europe, analysts caution. The trend appears strongest in countries such as Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. Pawel Zerka, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a different story in eastern Europe, and often in the south. But it\u2019s certainly the case that far-right parties are attracting a lot of support among younger voters.\u201d In Spain, the ultra-conservative Vox party\u2019s share of the under-35 vote soared from 22% in April 2019 to a record 34% that November, echoing its rollercoaster performance with the electorate as a whole. It fell back in July this year but still stands at 27%. In the Netherlands, the PVV surged to become the largest party among 18- to 34-year-olds, winning 17% of their vote against 7% previously. In Sweden\u2019s 2022 ballot, 22% of the 18-21 cohort voted for the far-right Sweden Democrats, against 12% in 2018. In the 2021 Saxony-Anhalt state election in eastern Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came top among voters under 30, while young voters were likewise predicted to help Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom party (FPO) win next year\u2019s national ballot. Zerka also identified economic insecurity as the most significant factor. \u201cYoung voters haven\u2019t moved rightwards on migration, abortion, minority rights,\u201d he said. \u201cFar-right parties have convinced them that they offer a credible economic alternative.\u201d Other factors include some far-right parties \u201cmanaging to position themselves as a \u2018cool\u2019 electoral option\u201d, Zerka said. \u201cThey are increasingly offering younger voters equally young, often charismatic politicians \u2013 people who speak their language.\u201d Jordan Bardella, the president of France\u2019s National Rally (RN), for example, was only 23 when he led the party\u2019s successful 2019 European election campaign, and 27 when he succeeded Le Pen as the far-right party\u2019s official leader last year. Zerka also cites far-right parties\u2019 social media skills: Spain\u2019s Vox has a particularly slick operation, and S\u0142awomir Mentzen, the 37-year-old leader of Poland\u2019s ultra-liberal far-right Konfederacja (Confederation) party, has 800,000 followers on TikTok. Several far-right parties have also proposed specific policy initiatives to attract younger voters: Le Pen\u2019s 2022 manifesto promised to scrap taxes for the under-30s, provide financial assistance to student workers and boost student housing. Jacob Davey, the head of policy and research at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue thinktank, identified the influence of a far- and ultra-right youth counterculture, typified by the far-right pan-European Generation Identity group, as an additional factor. Even if \u201ceconomic grievances, insecurities around housing, jobs, futures\u201d may account for much of the youth vote, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing the growth to fruition of a concerted far- and extreme-right effort to reach and radicalise young people\u201d. And finally, said De Vries, there was \u201csimply, normalisation. For many of these young voters, far-right parties have been part of the political landscape their whole lives. They\u2019ve grown up with them. There\u2019s not the stigmatisation there once was.\u201d In Amsterdam, Conny, 22, smoking a cigarette outside a grocery store in the working-class Noord neighbourhood, the only district in the city where the PVV finished first, made the same point. \u201cIt is the first time I voted,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole family voted PVV, and we were excited [Wilders] won.\u201d Life was becoming more expensive in Amsterdam, she said, but the outgoing government did not seem to care. \u201cMy mother\u2019s a nurse, and healthcare is not coping. Wilders campaigned on investing in healthcare and old people\u2019s homes. When it comes to migration, people from a war country deserve a better life here but it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of Dutch people.\u201d",

        "body": "I\u2019m nursing a drink at a diner, deep within the bowels of Melbourne Central station, when I realise something isn\u2019t right. I pull a pile of crumpled Monopoly dollars from my pocket and place them on the counter. \u201cKeep the change,\u201d I say. I\u2019ve just wrapped up at Monopoly Dreams, a new attraction in Melbourne, Australia that bills itself as a \u201cfully immersive and interactive Monopoly experience\u201d. It\u2019s essentially a theme park backed by big bucks, real and paper: a $20m adaptation of the Hasbro board game that\u2019s sold more than 275m copies. And yet something feels off. The experience follows a format that started in 2019 at Hong Kong\u2019s very own Mayfair, The Peak, where visitors are first whisked through Mr Monopoly\u2019s mansion. Instead of using his fortune to buy a digital platform to cultivate hate speech, this billionaire has spent his money adorning his home with museum displays of Monopoly sets and paintings of his beloved dog, Scottie. After touring the mansion, guests are let loose in Monopoly City, its streets filled with carnival games, claw machines and gacha machines. You can try to crack a code to break out of jail, or you can weave your way through a laser maze to Mr Monopoly\u2019s diamond vault. There\u2019s even a 4D cinema that screens a Melbourne-themed Mr Monopoly adventure, with moving seats, gusts of air and the odd water spritz. But there\u2019s at least some sense of civic responsibility. One game\u2019s aim is repairing busted pipes at the Water Works; another involves fixing the power at the Electric Company by smacking and stamping on buttons. It\u2019s heartening to think that the children helping ailing utilities at Monopoly Dreams today may grow up to help dysfunctional telcos switch their networks back on. You can even get your foot in the door of Melbourne\u2019s broken property market with a print-out of a personalised title deed, complete with your name and an official-looking stamp, (I\u2019m now the proud owner of Queen Victoria Market). While make-believing as a landlord, I forget we\u2019re in the grips of a rental crisis. At least in Monopoly, cut-throat as it can be, you can\u2019t jack up rents without making actual improvements to the property, like building a house or a hotel. You\u2019d also be laughed out of the game for suggesting negative gearing or capital gains tax discounts approach anything remotely resembling fair play. Playing games earns you Monopoly money, which at the current going rate, pending further rampant inflation, works out to A$0.10 for one Monopoly dollar. It can be spent at the gift shop, or at the diner \u2013 Monopoly cafe \u2013 on pun-heavy food and drinks. My limited success lands me a passionfruit mini-cupcake to go with my drink. It\u2019s only after I pay the bill, though, that I finally figure out what\u2019s really bothering me: Monopoly Dreams is lovely. It lacks the meanness inherent to the board game, where you can only win if everyone else loses. Here, a group of teenagers cheer on a child at a bag toss game. A couple shares a smile as they let an excited kid squeeze past them in the laser maze queue. One of the friendly staff discretely lets someone struggling with a carnival game have a few free extra goes, on Mr Monopoly\u2019s dime. I\u2019m reminded of the original inventor of what we know as Monopoly: Lizzie Magie, a Georgist feminist who intended the game as an educational tool to warn of the pitfalls of unfettered capitalism. The rules we follow today were just one of two rule sets she came up with for what she called The Landlord\u2019s Game. In the other set, named Prosperity, you win when everyone else wins: when the player with the least amount of money manages to double it. Even though that part never really caught on, some of its spirit still lingers. In all games, whether it\u2019s a round of Monopoly or crawling on the floor dodging lasers at Monopoly Dreams, the ultimate goal is to have fun, and when someone has fun, everyone has fun \u2013 a net gain for the world\u2019s shared Community Chest that is joy. Then again, this all could just be the espressGO martini talking. Monopoly Dreams is open seven days a week at Melbourne Central",

        "body": "Dan Jennings\u2019s greatest regret after 25 years in local radio had been missing out on an interview with his idol, Paul Weller. It did not seem likely that the 47-year-old former broadcaster would get much closer to realising the goal in his new career in project management. With time on his hands during lockdown, Jennings launched a podcast for other Weller super fans, entitled Desperately Seeking Paul, but it unexpectedly became something of a hit and after three years, coming up to 180 episodes and a highly fruitful chance encounter with Weller himself in a bar below the Guardian\u2019s offices in King\u2019s Cross in north London, he finally got his Modfather. On 19 December, the result of three hours of roving conversation with Weller at his studio in Ripley, in Surrey, will be aired, covering everything from the star\u2019s childhood in Woking, to his discovery of clothes, musings on religion and continued anxiety about performing. It had been a long time coming. Jennings had few expectations for his hobby when he started out in December 2020 but it happily snowballed and thanks to a host of tantalising nuggets that Weller aficionados love (the 65-year-old is still anxious about performing, sends musical voice notes to pals at 3am and worries about E numbers in his food), the podcast has recently been regularly topping the Apple and Spotify music history categories. Interviewees have ranged from Weller\u2019s bandmates, past and present, to the album producers and the sleeve designers of the Jam and Style Council records. The former Sunday Times political editor David Cracknell, who was interviewed about playing keyboards on a Weller track, described the podcast as a \u201cbiographical Kama Sutra\u201d for a \u201cWeller geek\u201d, with the crowning jewels for many being the chats with Weller\u2019s sister, Nicky, and mother, Ann. She fondly (sort of) recalled ironing \u201call their bloody suits, shirts\u201d when her son and his childhood friend, the Jam co-founder Steve Brooks, started to play their music outside of the confines of Paul\u2019s bedroom. But an interview with Weller himself, known as the Modfather for his key role in the 1970s and 80s mod revival, had proved elusive. It was only after bumping into the singer-songwriter in the Rotunda bar at Kings Place in King\u2019s Cross that Weller coyly admitted to being a sometime listener and agreed to take part in the very final episode of the Paul Weller Fan Podcast: Desperately Seeking Paul. \u201cI went to a gig at Kings Place and went out for a drink outside, just grabbed a beer on the canal,\u201d said Jennings. \u201cThere was Jacko Peake, who is in Paul\u2019s band now, a flute player and sax player, and Tom Van Heel who plays keys for Paul. They\u2019ve both been on the podcast. So I wander over, it was, \u2018Hi how\u2019s it going?\u2019 And tucked around the pillar was Paul Weller. He went, \u2018Oh, hi, it\u2019s Dan isn\u2019t it?\u2019 So he knew who I was. \u201cWe chatted for a little bit and he said, \u2018I have listened to a few of the podcasts, it\u2019s a bit weird to listen to a podcast all about me but what you\u2019re doing is brilliant, you should do a book\u2019. And I was like, \u2018Well, yeah, we need you to come on\u2019. So, he says, \u2018OK, yeah, well, I\u2019m gonna think about it\u2019. I was thinking, \u2018Think about it? Bloody hell.\u201d After the gig, Jennings was looking at his phone working out how to get home, when Weller wandered over again to talk about the gig. \u201cHe said, \u2018Really nice to meet you\u2019 and went off and then just as he was leaving he came back and he just like did this handshake with two hands and said, \u2018You know what, let\u2019s do it. A Christmas special, it\u2019ll be really good\u2019.\u201d The last podcast with Weller will be the 180th. Jennings said one of his favourite interviews had been with Annajoy David, who together with Billy Bragg and Weller was part of Red Wedge, an initiative to build support for Labour in the 1980s through music. Jennings, whose last broadcasting role was hosting the drive-time slot for Radio 2-Ten FM, now rebranded as Heart Thames Valley, said it was something of a relief that the focus of all his attention and effort turned out to be \u201cdown to earth and genuine\u201d. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think about fame and stardom and he\u2019s not lost in showbiz, or any of that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when it came to do it, it felt like actually, I was just chatting to this hugely talented, hardworking, really open bloke.\u201d",

        "body": "The approach to Jamie Oliver\u2019s new restaurant in London\u2019s Covent Garden has some magic about it, not least because it\u2019s next to the theatre where Disney\u2019s Frozen is running. Beside Theatre Royal\u2019s columned entrance and underneath a shining backlit poster of Queen Elsa letting it go, the restaurant, Jamie Oliver Catherine St, welcomes guests with a Christmas tree, twinkly lights and a menu promising \u201celevated British classics\u201d. Like Disney and Christmas itself, Oliver is a feel-good proposition: lovable and familiar. This is his first UK restaurant opening since the collapse of his empire of 22 Jamie\u2019s Italian outlets in 2019, and it feels like no accident that it has opened just as the festive season begins, when spirits are at their highest. And there\u2019s lots to be high spirited about: it is a delicious concept from a man who knows, and cares deeply about, good food. Oliver has said most of the menu is inspired by the food he grew up with at his parents\u2019 pub \u2013 his dad Trevor\u2019s chicken, for example, a \u201ctender breast stuffed with wild mushrooms and wrapped in puff pastry\u201d or scampi and chips, which he\u2019s re-imagined with langoustine and \u201coutrageous pickle ketchup\u201d. But there is more than a nod to the time he spent at the River Caf\u00e9 too \u2013 where he was famously scouted by a TV crew in the 90s \u2013 with a fresh pasta section and their decadent chocolate nemesis cake. Also back are some of the most-loved dishes from his old restaurants, such as Fifteen\u2019s salad with burrata, clementine and winter leaves. It is, in essence, Oliver\u2019s greatest hits album, scored by excellent sourcing of ingredients. This is a big thing at Jamie Oliver Catherine St, where they shout loudly about where things have come from, mostly in the British Isles. It is a relatively neat menu which tries to offer something for everybody. Several key dishes had sold out by 7pm (maybe a gaggle of polyester-clad post-matinee mini Elsas are responsible for the absence of the fettuccine I\u2019d been eyeing up). We kicked off with croquettes, delicious spheres of pureed potato, leek and lancashire cheese, with a glass of fizz. I was intrigued by the vegan \u201ctarama\u201d of cold-smoked silken tofu accompanied by pretty breakfast radishes, and the gravlax, beetroot and vodka cured Loch Duart salmon was thick-cut and lovely, arranged to encircle a splat of horseradish cream. The portions are generous, like my richly flavoured pappardelle with mushroom sauce, or the charred Kashmiri-spiced tofu skewer, which needed some oomph, but the bed of smoky tahini aubergine and harissa yoghurt helped out. Many of these dishes are billed as Oliver family favourites \u2013 and I believe it. Of the roast chicken stroganoff with shoestring fries (\u00a319pp to share) he has said: \u201cThis is the food I want to eat with Jools\u201d, whose image is one of several on the walls. The space is warm and welcoming, as you would expect from Oliver \u2013 sleek and comfortable banquettes and tea lights, raw linen lamp shades and boughs of dried flowers, a glowing bar and a soundtrack that alienates no one. Maybe this is what they need to watch out for: blandness at a not insignificant price point. The restaurant estimates \u00a342 a head but this is very conservative \u2013 between two, we spent \u00a3150 on three courses and one drink each. Oliver has been humble about getting \u201ca second chance\u201d in hospitality. Like Elsa, like Christmas, Oliver always brings a bit of magic, but with an ambitious restaurant \u2013 even one like this, with no ambitions to become a chain \u2013 Oliver himself can\u2019t be the only reason to believe in it. I will go back, probably accompanied by a small person wearing a tiara. Maybe then I\u2019ll get a plate of that fettuccine.",

        "body": "Taxing the better-off is not going to be easy. For one thing, no one can agree on how to go about it. Thinktanks have put forward various proposals, usually targeting individual wealth. Voices across the political spectrum agree with the need for such a move. Free-market economists are just as worried about the excessive accumulation of personal capital as those on the left. Wealth erodes the desire to work, and encourages the kind of nepotism that historians know sows the seeds of societal destruction. And this process can happen within a few generations when the tax on incomes is much higher than that on wealth. Last week a report from UBS bank found the latest entrants to the billionaire category gained more of their fortune from inheritance than from hard work. Britain is not alone in becoming host to a moneyed class who live off asset gains and rents. It\u2019s just that, as the earliest industrial nation and the most successful imperialist, it leads the pack. The disagreement becomes \u2013 at least so far \u2013 insurmountable when it comes to how to tax individual wealth. In 2020, the Social Market Foundation proposed a levy on property that would bring an individual\u2019s main home into the tax net for the first time. A 10% surcharge on the profit from selling a home would be a relatively light tax, given the colossal gains from selling real estate over the past 40 years, and would raise upwards of \u00a3400bn over 20 years, from what the SMF said was an estimated \u00a35tn of property assets (a figure that in 2022 actually hit more than \u00a37tn). James Kirkup, who was head of the SMF when the proposal was made, had been political editor of the Daily Telegraph. He had strong connections in the Tory party and judged that this might be acceptable, given the tax was slight and all in the future. But he was wrong and the idea died. Likewise, wealth tax reforms proposed by the IPPR, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the Resolution Foundation, the TUC, the New Economics Foundation and the many others that seek to conjure more money from share-owning and property never gained traction. In large part this is due to the competition for public attention that drives thinktank funding. Why would they coalesce around a rival\u2019s idea? But those who support the idea of a wealth tax should agree to back a single policy programme. Without agreement based on some significant compromise, the levy will never get off the ground. The most efficient and fairest tax is one applied to land ownership. Most economists know this, but believe the moment has passed now that property has become such a high-value asset. A land tax would affect an ancient aristocracy that owns the most treasured and valuable of British assets, but there is also a trend for decision makers and people of influence \u2013 be they MPs, chief executives or newspaper owners \u2013 to possess expensive plots of land. These holdings would face much higher annual tax rates than under Kirkup\u2019s tax scheme. Homes in prime locations bought long before the property price boom of the past 25 years would attract the highest rates of land value tax. And while there would be the promise of income tax cuts to compensate for more wealth taxes, the professional classes and property-owning retirees know they would be unlikely to benefit overall. Taxes, of whatever kind, also have their limits in an age when the costs of government are going up every year. The nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure needs more cash, welfare programmes are underfunded and an ageing population is only going to become more costly. And putting up taxes every year is not good politics, even when the taxes are well designed. Last week, the Productivity Institute produced a blueprint with the aim of showing how we can all work more effectively, generating more income and more tax from the same resources. Another answer can be found in the programmes articulated by those who argue we simply consume less as part of a \u201cpost-growth\u201d or \u201cdegrowth\u201d strategy. These are radical alternatives to the solution most commonly pursued by governments \u2013 applying ever-higher surcharges on the incomes from work and a policy of borrowing that has become hugely expensive in the post-Covid era. Tory leaders say more of the same is the answer. Labour follows suit, disagreeing only about how much of the money raised should be ploughed into the same tired system. It\u2019s easy to see why. Public inertia is strong and thinktank solutions lack momentum. Some collaboration among those on the left of the debate might help.",

        "body": "A British soldier has died while off duty in Kenya, the Ministry of Defence has said. Maj Kevin McCool, 32, was reportedly on a motorcycle trip off base when he was attacked. The MoD said he died on 29 November but that it would not be releasing any more details. His next of kin have been informed. The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, described his death as a \u201ctragic loss\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the tributes of those who knew him that Maj McCool was an exceptional person and an exceptional soldier, loved and respected in equal measure, who served his country with distinction. \u201cMy thoughts and sympathies are with his family, friends, and colleagues currently coming to terms with this most tragic loss.\u201d The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said: \u201cMy heart goes out to Maj McCool\u2019s family, friends and fellow soldiers today in the face of their tragic loss. The tributes pouring out for him show a man who served his country with pride, integrity and bravery. His service will not be forgotten.\u201d McCool was commissioned from Sandhurst in August 2014 and served in Europe, the Middle East, the Falklands and Africa. \u201cAs well as a glittering operational record, he also aced many of the military\u2019s hardest courses. His fitness was legendary, once beating the whole battalion on a two-miler, as was his endurance,\u201d the MoD said. His commanding officer said McCool \u201cwas living his best life, doing a job he loved, with people he loved\u201d. He added: \u201cI will never forget my final memory of him, which was on operations; he had just come off the ground having slept a handful of hours in as many days. We discussed the possibility of having to deploy another team into the operational furnace from which he had just come. He stopped me mid-sentence, fixed me with his piercing blue eyes, and simply said: \u2018Send me.\u2019 \u201cA bright light has gone out amongst our ranks. He will be missed, but never forgotten.\u201d The commanding officer said McCool was \u201cthe best of us\u201d, adding: \u201cKevin McCool\u2019s eyes shone with his spirit of adventure and with his focused, determined nature. He was a pilgrim soul in the truest sense. Intelligent, proactive and selfless, he was at his best and at his happiest whilst serving others and whilst facing challenges \u2018in the arena\u2019. \u201cAs a soldier, his courage and talent were proven on operations. As a leader, he had a compelling character and easy charm that all who met him warmed to. And as a man, he had a deep humility which displayed a wisdom beyond his years.\u201d The British army has a permanent training support unit based mainly in Nanyuki, 124 miles north of Nairobi, with a small element also based in Kenya\u2019s capital. It provides \u201cdemanding training to exercising units preparing to deploy on operations or assume high-readiness tasks\u201d, according to the army\u2019s website. The British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) consists of about 100 permanent staff and a reinforcing short-tour cohort of another 280 personnel. Under an agreement with the Kenyan government, up to six infantry battalions a year carry out eight-week exercises in Kenya.",

        "body": "Set on the front meadow of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, minutes from the Guinness brewery, it is no surprise the first wave of tickets for Dublin\u2019s Forbidden Fruit festival sold out within days. The line-up \u2013 a heady mix of veterans, newcomers and nostalgia acts \u2013 is one of many festivals currently being announced for next summer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Nelly Furtado, who hasn\u2019t played in Ireland for 24 years, Bicep and Barry Can\u2019t Swim, who\u2019s from that generation of artists with ironic names that audiences love\u201d says festival booker Will Rolfe. But behind the scenes, he says, it\u2019s been a \u201creal challenge\u201d. The festival confirmed 90% of its first-choice artists, but that is rare. \u201cThe industry is struggling with a shortage of top headliners. The biggest and best artists are doing their own tours rather than festivals because it\u2019s more lucrative.\u201d Forbidden Fruit is not alone. Festival organisers are reporting that the UK is no longer an appealing destination for global headline acts. With huge numbers of green spaces being given the go-ahead to hold events, organisers say there are struggling to find bands to fill them, and Brexit border delays are making matters worse. Securing US acts is especially difficult. Many American shows operate a \u201cdynamic\u201d ticketing model, where the cost adjusts according to demand. As a result, prices can be astronomical. US tour tickets for Bruce Springsteen can go for several thousand dollars. For Taylor Swift, it is just shy of $900. Although an A-grade festival headliner in the UK can expect a fee of \u00a32m-plus, financial expectations for US acts are far greater than this. There will always be exceptions for artists who just want to do the show, such as Glastonbury, or who want the exposure and understand there is a fee difference. \u201cSome will make less money and be OK with that,\u201d says Rolfe. The fear is that the UK is becoming irrelevant. \u201cThe UK just isn\u2019t an attractive offer at the moment,\u201d says Sacha Lord, co-founder of Parklife festival and night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester. \u201cWhen you\u2019re booking these huge global artists, you\u2019re competing with the rest of the world. It\u2019s really tough out there.\u201d Noah Ball, programmer for Dorset\u2019s We Out Here festival and Cross The Tracks in Brixton, says getting headliners locked in is trickier for next summer than it has been in previous years. \u201cThe cost of events has gone up 30-40% over the last few years. It was always a risky business and it\u2019s become even riskier. It\u2019s very important for events to hit the nail on the head and really get the line-up right.\u201d Artists may be asking for more money, but it is more expensive than ever for them to tour, says Claudio Lillo, booking agent for A$AP Rocky, Playboi Carti, Priya Ragu and Ezra Collective: \u201cFestivals are saying they don\u2019t have the budget, but artists\u2019 costs have increased too.\u201d The amount of stagecraft expected is also rising. For big headliners, such as Lana Del Rey, it is not just dancers and back-up singers. There are choreography, screens, filming, production and rehearsal costs. For electronic artists, lasers and lights are just the start. It can cost tens, if not hundreds, of thousands just to get on stage. At a new 15,000-capacity venue in London, the talent and production and overall spend is in the tens of millions. Brexit has also made matters worse. In the past, playing in the UK would be part of a European tour. \u201cYou might do Brussels one night, Paris the next and then Manchester two nights later,\u201d says Lord. But now no one can risk equipment being held at the border. \u201cIf that happens you\u2019re going to lose your headliners. It\u2019s caused major issues in the industry.\u201d On top of this, being paid in sterling is \u201cnot great\u201d, he says. Kelly Wood, national organiser for live performance at the Musicians\u2019 Union, says there just \u201caren\u2019t as many acts coming\u201d. They have to factor in time for travel checks and it\u2019s putting people off, she says. Promoters are instead looking to homegrown talent or working more collaboratively with joint offers to make it appealing. Another factor is that cash-strapped councils are hiring out their green spaces to festivals and there are simply not enough big headliners to fill the huge number of events on offer. Luke Huxham, director of development and place for London\u2019s and Drumsheds, thinks next summer will be competitive in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d way. \u201cA lot of promoters are competing to book the same artists.\u201d Sarah McBriar, founder and creative director of AVA festival in Belfast, which is in its 10th year, says people still want to go to festivals and their tickets sell quickly, but the weekend they are on at the end of May, there are now \u201cfour or five others at the same time\u201d. Although electronic star Fred Again has managed to go from backroom pop producer to headline the Reading and Leeds festival in a couple of years, for most it takes years of touring to cultivate a fanbase. The problem, says Ball, is festivals want proven ticket-sellers. \u201cThere\u2019s a disparity between the number of acts that build to a large scale and the number of events that have capacity for huge crowds.\u201d One of the big criticisms is that line-ups look similar, but Lillo thinks festival bookers are not taking risks: \u201cThey say there aren\u2019t enough headliners, but how are you going to become one unless someone takes a chance on you?\u201d",

        "body": "When the first season of the Channel 4 sitcom Derry Girls debuted in 2018, the show\u2019s lead actor Saoirse-Monica Jackson had something of a flip out. Her performance as Erin Quinn, one of four Catholic schoolgirls (and an English fella) living in Derry on the Northern Ireland border in the final throes of the Troubles, was \u2013 she now realised \u2013 quite out there: full of adolescent facial contortions that dripped with awkwardness, disdain and indignation. Jackson had been inspired by the punk irascibility of her teenage cousin and the animated comic tics of Jim Carrey and Rowan Atkinson. But now she feared that she had blown her big break. \u201cI felt in a perpetual state of fear,\u201d recalls the 30-year-old Jackson now. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy: I didn\u2019t think of it as a risk when I was doing it because Lisa [McGee], the writer, instilled such faith in me. I\u2019d basically auditioned and I just thought that Erin was very physical and that the madness of the world and all the characters around her would lend itself to a physical comedy performance.\u201d Jackson, who was playing a teenager, but was actually 24, began to catastrophise. \u201cWhen it first came out and it was commented on a lot, I felt extremely vulnerable and really anxious,\u201d she goes on. \u201cAnd felt scared that I would never get cast in anything else again. And I was terrified that I was just\u2026 bad.\u201d It turns out that Jackson needn\u2019t have worried. Over three seasons, Derry Girls became the most popular Channel 4 comedy since Father Ted, and broke viewing records in Northern Ireland. When it transferred to Netflix, the show became a global hit. And Jackson has, in fact, worked again, appearing this summer in the $190m DC superhero flick The Flash, alongside Ezra Miller and Ben Affleck. Upcoming, she is in the Paramount+ period thriller The Doll Factory, adapted from Elizabeth Macneal\u2019s 2019 novel about scandal and murder in the Victorian art establishment in the buildup to the 1851 Great Exhibition. There\u2019s also a Netflix series, The Decameron, based on Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s 14th-century collection of comic short stories. Still, Jackson finds that it gives her courage to remember the insecurity she felt in the early days on Derry Girls. \u201cI was so absorbed in the anxiety of it that I forgot it was working,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was obviously working. The show was a big success and people loved it. That was a lesson for me to learn creatively: if you half-arse a big decision, it\u2019s never going to work and really land.\u201d We are meeting at the end of the Observer\u2019s photoshoot, at a studio in north London. It\u2019s been a long day, but Jackson loves fashion and is down with all the dressing-up. Off-duty, she wears skinny jeans, Adidas shell-toes and a vibrant, brushed-wool Fendi sweater she bought in Rome while filming The Decameron. She\u2019s much more poised than Erin Quinn, but shares her comedic timing. When a dog, belonging to one of the shoot team, becomes a little over-familiar with my trouser leg, Jackson scrunches her face and deadpans, \u201cI feel cheated on now, because he was humping me and I thought I was special.\u201d Derry Girls, the final season of which dropped in spring 2022, remains a touchstone for Jackson and probably always will. She grew up in and around Derry and went to an all-girls Catholic secondary school there, not a million miles from the one in the show. So it was not a surprise that the series resonated deeply with her; what was less expected was that the city has now become a tourist hotspot. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything will ever compare to that experience,\u201d she says. \u201cThere will be other jobs where you move to a different country or they financially make you feel more secure or they will probably stretch me more emotionally as an actor. But the sentiment of Derry Girls and the fundamental change it\u2019s made\u2026 Well, what can ever be as big as that personally for me? There will never be anything like that.\u201d One moment where it clicked for Jackson came last year when Julian Smith MP, who was secretary of state for Northern Ireland under Boris Johnson, referenced the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Derry Girls, which had just concluded, in a debate in the House of Commons. \u201cThat was one of the most surreal experiences I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she says. \u201cHe gave this speech where he\u2019s talking about the importance of the Good Friday Agreement and Erin\u2019s monologue [in the final episode]. I did not think that a character I played in a comedy would be talked about in Westminster by one of Boris Johnson\u2019s cronies. I just feel like I\u2019m in an upside-down land! We made a show about girls talking about fingering and having a good time. And now this, it\u2019s just so crazy.\u201d Jackson leaves an extended, almost reverential pause, before adding solemnly, \u201cObviously Derry Girls is a lot more than fingering.\u201d As Jackson notes, there wasn\u2019t a great precedent of actors from Derry making it big when she was growing up. Bronagh Gallagher, who was in The Commitments and smokes a bong in Pulp Fiction, was the main one. Jackson\u2019s dad, Sean, is from Derry, and her mother, Ruth, is from County Donegal, 20 miles away in the south, and she split her time between the two places. When she was born, Sean was an engineer and Ruth was a chef, but over the years they had \u201csooo many businesses\u201d: her mother, for example, ran a pub and later became a child psychologist. Jackson, though, was always fixated on one goal, to act, and feels indebted to her parents for not trying to talk her out of it. \u201cEspecially now I\u2019m older, I really appreciate the way I was brought up,\u201d she says. \u201cMy parents had this belief in me that I didn\u2019t really need to have a Plan B, because, if I had a Plan B, that means I didn\u2019t really believe in Plan A. Which is fucking mental! For some reason, they just had this blind faith that it would be OK. But I had that blind faith, too.\u201d After leaving home at 18, Jackson studied at the Arden School of Theatre in Manchester before moving to London. She did some odd jobs, such as hawking HelloFresh boxes door-to-door, while trying to find an agent. \u201cMy dad told me a story about him setting up a business when he was in his early 20s and he was ringing these companies to try and get them to buy whatever he was selling,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the point where I was looking for my first agent and he was like, \u2018Remember, you only need one yes.\u2019\u201d Jackson\u2019s intense bluey-green eyes go moist. \u201cIt\u2019s making me a wee bit emotional thinking about it, but he said to me, \u2018I would get up in the morning every day and I\u2019d sit on the phone all day long and it could be nearly three weeks before someone said yes to me. But it only took one yes.\u2019 And it was so applicable to what I was trying to do in acting: fake it till you make it.\u201d In the aftermath of Derry Girls, Jackson has particularly sought out dramatic and non-comic roles. Landing Patty Spivot in The Flash, however, came totally out of nowhere. \u201cIt was this crazy whirlwind that I just couldn\u2019t believe,\u201d she says. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be auditioning for a superhero film. So I just sent a tape and the director Andy [Muschietti], who\u2019s a lovely little fella, loved it. He didn\u2019t know that I was in Derry Girls or anything. It was just a random tape that he\u2019d seen and he thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we cast her?\u2019 It all felt like a massive fluke.\u201d From Derry Girls, Jackson had become used to TV\u2019s long days, being in every scene. The Flash offered a change of pace and scale. \u201cWith these big jobs,\u201d she says, \u201ceven when you\u2019re a smaller part and you\u2019re in and out, you\u2019re still contracted for a big amount of time, which is like happy days!\u201d The film shot on the Warner Bros complex in Leavesden, north London, and it was Jackson\u2019s first experience of a studio film lot. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a schoolyard outside the trailers,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s summer, it\u2019s London, everybody\u2019s hanging outside the trailers having a craic. And the lovely girl that played Supergirl [Sasha Calle], we got quite friendly, so we\u2019d go over and knock on each other\u2019s trailers after lunch going, \u2018Do you want to go for a walk?\u2019 It would honestly feel like a school trip sometimes.\u201d Jackson often seems to form strong connections when she\u2019s working. Jamie-Lee O\u2019Donnell, Michelle from Derry Girls, is one of her best friends and they speak most days. On The Decameron, it was Zosia Mamet, who played Shoshanna on the HBO comedy Girls. In the series, Jackson plays Misia, a servant to Pampinea (Mamet), but mainly they bonded over their often mispronounced first names. (Famously, Ryan Gosling delivered a primer on how to pronounce Saoirse in 2015, when presenting another acting Saoirse, Ronan, with an award: \u201cIt\u2019s Ser-sha, like inertia.\u201d) \u201cExactly!\u201d screams Jackson. \u201cThat actually was my first conversation with Zosia. We both have Scrabble-bag names: just like a hand in the bag and then a couple of vowels and a few letters thrown in and that\u2019ll do you, those sort of names. We had different directors coming in throughout the series and they all gave us a combined name of Zersha or Zosha, which I loved. So we both answered to any pharmaceutical company that it sounded like after that.\u201d The intense bonds that form on set are a big part of what Jackson loves about her job. \u201cOn The Decameron, we were basically each other\u2019s family for seven months,\u201d she says, \u201cand acting is the most peculiar profession to speed up any intimacy. On day two, I had my fingers in Zosia\u2019s mouth and she had her fingers in my mouth and\u2026 Haha, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to be so strange in print! But that\u2019s what the job entails sometimes. And thank God you are a nice person after it, because otherwise it would be, \u2018Oh, nightmare! They\u2019ve been into my mouth and I don\u2019t like them!\u2019\u201d I make the dad-joke insight that when Jackson talks about The Decameron, I can\u2019t not picture David Cameron. \u201cI rang my brother because I was elated about the job, it was a part that I really, really wanted,\u201d she replies. \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018That\u2019s really good,\u2019 but he just naturally assumed I was going to be playing David Cameron\u2019s wife. It\u2019s a big leap but fair enough. A job I would happily do as well, if anyone\u2019s reading this.\u201d After playing a schoolgirl while in her 20s, Jackson was also particularly determined to land roles where she played her real age. \u201cPeople are really nice to me and treat me with glass mittens on \u2013 that\u2019s not the expression is it? \u2013 because they think I\u2019m so young,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes people talk down to me because they don\u2019t realise I\u2019m a 30-year-old woman who\u2019s been out on her own for years.\u201d Jackson\u2019s birthday was last month and she\u2019s excited by kicking on with a new decade. \u201cYour 30s always feel like the doing years, don\u2019t they?\u201d Jackson describes her life as more \u201cchill\u201d these days. She\u2019s been seeing the Scottish DJ and music producer Denis Sulta (real name: Hector Barbour) for three years and they recently bought a place in Liverpool. \u201cHe\u2019s from Glasgow and I\u2019m from Derry, so geographically it\u2019s bang in the middle. So it\u2019s fair,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cAnd I have a lot of family connections in Liverpool and childhood memories there. And it\u2019s great for a blow-dry, all the beauty treatments are good, so it\u2019s good for a Derry girl like me. Hec travels a lot and I do, too, but the times that we do get at home together are so lovely. The wee Liverpool hideout. The scouse house!\u201d Downtime for Jackson is often spent cooking. She showcased some of these skills on the Great New Year\u2019s Bake Off in 2020 when, as an unfancied outsider \u2013 she had never baked before \u2013 she destroyed four other Derry Girls cast members to walk off with the ornamental cake stand. \u201cOh Jesus, baking is a different beast, but my competition wasn\u2019t high with the Derry Girls,\u201d she says. \u201cThe standards were low, so that\u2019s how I won that. My mum actually said she\u2019s never been prouder and I was like, \u2018Are you serious? I made a great cake and that\u2019s what you\u2019re proud of?\u2019\u201d We need to wrap up: Jackson has to get the train back to Liverpool. Derry Girls will always stay with her, but her career beyond the show is ratcheting up nicely. In 2021, Jackson met Joanna Lumley in Derry for the BBC travel series, Joanna Lumley\u2019s Britain. Off-camera, the Absolutely Fabulous star asked Jackson how she felt about going up for different parts now and she admitted she was worried she might never escape from being associated with comedy. \u201cAnd she gave me an amazing piece of advice,\u201d says Jackson, picking up the story. \u201cShe was like, \u2018You\u2019ll always be a perpetual schoolgirl to some people in their eyes, but being in these comedy shows gives you a real ticket to the world.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t really know what she meant until a year or two later. But people are just so welcoming when they meet you sometimes. Not all the time, obviously. But when they meet me and they\u2019ve watched the show and they associate you with laughter.\u201d Jackson giggles, \u201cThey associate you with a joyous moment when they were laughing at you!\u201d The Doll Factory is available to stream on Paramount+ now.

We live by the Tuscan coast in Forte dei Marmi, and our church is only round the corner, so I\u2019ll often walk. Not attending isn\u2019t an option \u2013 it\u2019s the day of the Lord. And afterwards? I get back around midday, then we\u2019ll have lunch as a family. We all follow a strict, healthy diet \u2013 even on a Sunday there\u2019s nothing special being served. We are Italians, so there\u2019s pasta, but now it\u2019s made of ancient grains with less gluten. Then I\u2019ll rest, and practise music \u2013 studying, singing and playing piano, as I do every day. Do you cook? Absolutely not. I tried back when I was young \u2013 it didn\u2019t go well. On rare occasions I\u2019ll cook for friends. I can pull off a carbonara; anything else feels an unnecessary risk for me and my guests to take. Sundays growing up? Church with my grandmother. I\u2019d play the organ. And being out in the countryside with friends, getting into trouble. My fondest memories are of chasing after girls \u2013 the successful love stories. Getting dates wasn\u2019t easy. Any exercise? Nope. I\u2019m a very lazy person. In general, I only do what I enjoy, which does not include going to the gym. I do love football, but as a spectator only. Inter Milan is our team. I\u2019ve been obsessed since I was little. Now, I watch with my children. How do you relax? If I\u2019m not working, I\u2019ll read or invite friends round. I love to play chess, too, mostly online, not that I\u2019m any good, I\u2019m still trying to improve. If the weather is good, I might head out on one of the horses. Sunday night? If I have a concert, I\u2019ll perform. When you\u2019re a singer, what night of the week it is doesn\u2019t matter. Otherwise, I\u2019m in bed early, around 10pm. I don\u2019t like to be up late. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what I do before I sleep\u2026 I\u2019ll leave that to your imagination.

        "body": "Collaborative tracks made by the unlikely duo of electronic producers Hudson Mohawke (Glasgow) and Tiga (Montreal) have been trickling out slowly since a banging rave track called Love Minus Zero first appeared in 2020 (a Bob Dylan song of the same name is not an obvious reference point). Despite being very different creatures \u2013 the younger HudMo is a famed maximalist, while cult figure Tiga is a rave veteran with a sleeker aesthetic \u2013 the two clicked. \u201cNo apology, no cynicism, no irony, no winking,\u201d is their mission statement of sorts. This 16-track collaboration, pointedly called L\u2019Ecstasy, functions a bit like a less in-your-face version of the Skrillex/Fred Again/Four Tet juggernaut sweeping clubland. Here, bleary, ecstatic passages break up the squelchier, ravier and occasionally more punishing highs. The odd track out is the best: In Order 2, a melancholic wallow in goth chords whose heartbreak theme is unexpectedly disrupted by a glorious saxophone line (Wolfgang Tillmans loved it so much he provided the LP\u2019s powdery artwork). BuyBuySell is another crisp workout defying easy classification. But there is precisely nothing wrong with the rubbery techno of Duro, or superb guest features by Channel Tres on Feel the Rush, or Jesse Boykins III on Silence of Love, either.",

        "body": "Falling in love with a choreographer is a bit like falling in love full stop. You realise you have shared interests and tastes. Perhaps you note a few imperfections, but that doesn\u2019t take anything away from the joy and interest with which they fill your lives. I have fallen in love with Trajal Harrell \u2013 and Paris shares my passion. This year\u2019s Festival d\u2019Automne is presenting a month-long portrait, encompassing nine of Harrell\u2019s creations. Based in Zurich, the 50-year-old American choreographer is hugely popular on the continent and the US and has toured relentlessly this year. Tambourines is a new piece inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter (1850), a book about one woman\u2019s complicated resistance to the forces that make her wear the letter A on her bodice, as a visible sign of her adultery. At the start, the dancers encourage the audience to read the Wikipedia entry for the novel, yet what unfolds is not a telling of the story but an imaginative act of meditation on the puritanical structure that encases the protagonist Hester Prynne, suggesting a freedom for her that she never found. In the first act (Fornication), the dancers of Schauspielhaus Z\u00fcrich Dance Ensemble, led by Harrell himself, swirl in rapid circles, hands raised above their faces. In the second (Education), they sit in a row, in brown robes with white collars, their hands now open as if reading books. In the third (Celebration), they dress in ever wilder outfits, processing down a spiral drawn on the bare stage. It seems like nothing, but it is everything, the precision of tiny movements, inflections of head and arms communicating the repression of a conformist society and the desire to break through. The emphasis on clothes as a means of expression perfectly suits Hawthorne\u2019s theme; the music is a tapestry of feeling and possibility. Harrell is a unique talent.",

        "body": "Instead of just dropping his first album of new material since 2002, Peter Gabriel has spent a year parcelling it out, a new song for each full moon. Finally assembled, i/o is a substantial late work from the ex-Genesis frontman, considering the human condition with genial positivity, wit and gloriously well-preserved vocals. Each song has a \u201cBright-Side\u201d and \u201cDark-Side\u201d mix, although Gabriel\u2019s generosity of spirit isn\u2019t something that can be mixed in or out of the music, as it brightens every corner of i/o. The album keeps circling around images of earth and water, gently obsessed by living, ageing, death, how things were before us and how they\u2019ll go on without us. Information, technology, religion and money recur as elemental forces that flood the earth or set it on fire, especially on typical Gabriel effortful funk tracks such as Panopticom and The Court. Pop fans will appreciate i/o and Olive Tree bearing his biggest, air-punching choruses since 1986\u2019s So, but the quieter moments are strong too. The magnificently eerie Four Kinds of Horses is the record\u2019s peak, while maternal elegy And Still feels like the most open, vulnerable song he has ever sung.",

But Giant Belch is stealing this cruddy elixir, and ratcheting up the rent on Milky Linda\u2019s dairy, too. Such is the backdrop to this Christmas fare at Stratford East \u2013 and it\u2019s as flimsy a backdrop as you\u2019d expect in a panto. The mud motif is soon forgotten, as that familiar tale takes centre-stage of gullible Jack, his beloved bovine Winnie, and some grand larceny perpetrated against an ogre in the clouds. The writer is Anna Jordan, sometimes of Killing Eve and Succession. She brings droll touches (\u201cMe and that beanstalk,\u201d cries our glamorous dame, \u201cwe\u2019re an up-skirter\u2019s dream!\u201d), but this is a trad not a rad take. There\u2019s no love interest: that\u2019s a departure. But the show does little that\u2019s new with the fairytale, nor anything interesting with its giant in the sky, whose threat evaporates on contact with some soppy words from Jack about learning to love oneself. It\u2019s fun, though. More at the RuPaul than the Roy Barraclough end of the dame scale, Nathan Kiley puts in a fine shift as Linda, whether bedecked in recycled crisp bags or an eye-catching coffee-cup frock (costumes by Lily Arnold). Lucy Frederick has fun as the giant\u2019s mouthy London henchwoman Flesh Creep, as does Billy Lynch as her simpering son. Nikhil Singh Rai\u2019s Jack makes a less vivid impression; one rather wonders why Winnie the Moo (sparkling Savanna Jeffrey) is so attached to her owner. A slapstick sequence involving almond milkshakes fell flat when I attended, and with one member of an already small ensemble missing through illness, some other sequences also wanted for oomph. But there are enough catchy songs by Robert Hyman, and spirit in the script and performances, to amount to, well, a hill of beans at least, if not a cloud-capped one. \u2022 At Theatre Royal Stratford East until 6 January",

She says so herself on this lascivious, playful piece of electro-funk. There\u2019s a lot going on here: a calypso rhythm underpinning heavily treated guitars and spikes of strings to create a monstrous dance groove. The lyric is overtly sexual, but as knowing and daring as anything by Liz Phair; there\u2019s no question about who\u2019s in control here. \u2013 Andrew Stafford For more: Sidewinder is currently on tour in the UK with Sophie Ellis-Bextor; her third album, The Last Resort, is slated for release in March 2024. Fig \u2013 Our Night For fans of: Bruce Springsteen, Soft Cell, Brandon Flowers Sydney six-piece Fig began as the solo project of frontman Tim Burnett, whose voice is plain anachronism \u2013 a showboating, Springsteen-y caterwaul that just as easily dissolves into a diaphanous falsetto. On this track \u2013 a single from the band\u2019s second album No Need to Rest \u2013 Burnett ascends high above a synth buzz and a stampede of percussion, eulogising the sort of night with a lover that\u2019s destined to become mythology. It\u2019s perfect 80s pastiche. Cue the montage. \u2013 Michael Sun For more: Listen to the rest of No Need to Rest, and watch the music video \u2013 a kitschy Halloween terror. Thelma Plum \u2013 We Don\u2019t Talk About It For fans of: Tia Gostelow, Stella Donnelly Thelma Plum\u2019s slinky new single will be familiar to many women, describing the fear of seeing an abusive ex with someone new, and the protective urge of sisterhood. \u201cIf it happened to me, it\u2019ll happen to her / It doesn\u2019t make it better that I went first,\u201d the Kamilaroi musician sings. We Don\u2019t Talk About It is a companion of sorts to her 2019 song Woke Blokes, which took aim at toxic masculinity and performative allyship. - Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen For more: Thelma Plum\u2019s latest EP, Meanjin, was released in 2022. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Willaris K and jamesjamesjames \u2013 Silversun For fans of: Fred Again, Calvin Harris\u2019s mid-2010s output, the film We Are Your Friends Brisbane producer jamesjamesjames is known for slick bubble gum dance songs that are heavily influenced by early 00s trance and house \u2013 think the Ministry Of Sound 2002 Annual filtered through a Tamagotchi. His new EP with Melbourne producer Willaris K, Silversun, loses the candy shell but retains his music\u2019s euphoric thrills and imperturbable drive. Highlights, including Crying at High Speed and Silversun, capture a distinctive sense of DayGlo melancholia. \u2013 Shaad D\u2019Souza For more: Listen to jamesjamesjames\u2019 calling card single, My Purple iPod Nano (2nd Gen). June Jones \u2013 Bubblegum For fans of: Charli XCX, Shygirl, Sophie Since making the move from Melbourne to Sydney, Jones has fully indulged in the sugary highs of dance music. Bubblegum \u2013 filled to the brim with rubbery beats, chipmunk background vocals, and glossy synths \u2013 is another perfect pop confection, following her previous single Good Girl. The song narrates a desire to be chewed and spat out, used for temporary fun. But there is a touch of melancholy here; as Jones sings, the sweetness only lasts \u201ctil I lose my flavour\u201d. \u2013 Isabella Trimboli For more: Listen to Jones\u2019 2022 record, Pop Music for Normal Women. The Summertimes \u2013 My Beautiful Girl Harbour For fans of: Teenage Fanclub, You Am I, The Church If you have a hankering for old-fashioned power pop, the Summertimes are for you. My Beautiful Girl Harbour has everything you could want: jangling guitars that dovetail and counterpoint, harmonies that go ooh-ooh and aah-aah, and a charming lyric set on Sydney harbour. It\u2019s the third single peeled off the Summertimes\u2019 self-titled album, which is making deserved inroads on American radio. Songwriters David Beniuk and David Challenger are backed by an all-star cast including Steve Bull from Icehouse, Tumbleweed\u2019s Steve O\u2019Brien and the ubiquitous Ashley Naylor. \u2013 Andrew Stafford For more: The Summertimes\u2019 self-titled debut is available via Bandcamp. The Native Cats \u2013 Suplex For fans of: The Fall, Rowland S Howard Hobart duo The Native Cats are one of Australia\u2019s most wonderful post-punk bands, putting out record after brilliant record. Their fifth full-length album, The Way On is the Way Off, may be their best - a perfect blend of sneering petulance, janky but tender piano numbers, and urgent, tightly wound bass. Suplex is a personal favourite. It starts simply enough: antagonistic guitars and vocals drenched in gleeful contempt, delivered by Chloe Alison Escott: \u201cPut some shimmy in your shoulders, get in there, get shoved!\u201d But midway through, the track shifts, with fragile piano and misty distortion engulfing the drums and guitars. \u2013 Isabella Trimboli For more: Listen to the band\u2019s new record The Way On Is the Way Off Cry Club \u2013 Wanna Wanna Wanna For fans of: Paramore, Motion City Soundtrack, Olivia Rodrigo If sparkling pop hooks and crunchy 80s guitars are your thing, Cry Club might be too. Melbourne\u2019s queer \u201cbubblegum punk\u201d duo has recently released a deluxe edition of their second album, Spite Will Save Me, and this glittering earworm is one of its bonus tracks (as well as a great cover of Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s Good 4 U). Singer Heather Riley\u2019s bright vocals brim with desire and frustration as they muse on a budding romance just out of reach. - Giselle Au-Nhien Nguyen For more: Spite Will Save Me and its deluxe edition are out now. Acopia \u2013 Eyes Shut For fans of: HTRK, Circuit des Yeux, Lolina The self-titled second album by Acopia, a Melbourne three-piece comprising electronic producers Morgan Wright, Lachlan McGeehan (Lil Uzu) and Kate Durman (Purient), improves on their striking 2022 debut in nearly every way, making their atmospheric, dubby take on dream pop sound richer, more distinctive, and more emotionally resonant. Eyes Shut, the standout, burns slowly before reaching a heavy, buffeting conclusion. \u2013 Shaad D\u2019Souza For more: Listen to Acopia\u2019s 2022 debut Chances. Memphis LK \u2013 Black and Blue For fans of: Mallrat, PinkPantheress, Erika de Casier Everyone is making music for wallflowers these days: people who stalk the edges of clubs, trading mumbled incantations and sidelong glances across the dancefloor. There\u2019s Erika de Casier\u2019s glassy R&amp;B \u2013 the bedrock for NewJeans\u2019 introverted K-pop \u2013 and PinkPantheress\u2019 viral hits where she spitballs, blas\u00e9, above skittish UK garage samples. Joining the whisper network is Memphis LK, whose latest EP unfurls like a secret. Opener Black and Blue is as opalescent as it sounds: a lovelorn declaration that gazes upwards at the firmament, breaking into a galactic squiggle halfway through whose closest analogue is the Silversun intro. \u2013 Michael Sun For more: Memphis LK\u2019s EP True Love and its Consequences is out now. This article was amended on 4 December 2023 to include an omitted songwriter on the track My Beautiful Girl Harbour.",

        "body": "Born in Penny Lane, Liverpool in 1958, Ian Broudie attended his first gig, the Beatles at the Liverpool Empire, when he was six. A member of punk band Big In Japan in his teens with Holly Johnson and the KLF\u2019s Bill Drummond, he went on to produce records by Echo and the Bunnymen, the Fall, Alison Moyet, Texas and the Coral. Recording as the Lightning Seeds from 1989, he has released seven albums, and his 1996 song for that year\u2019s UEFA European Championship, Three Lions, has been No 1 three times. He has just published his memoir, Tomorrow\u2019s Here Today, and the Lightning Seeds\u2019 35th anniversary tour starts next summer. Your songs are often tender, melancholic and heartfelt, but your roots are in the flamboyant post-punk scene in Liverpool. How did you fit in? I was the kid in the jumper and NHS glasses around all these bursts of colour. There was a feral quality, a wildness to that world around Mathew Street in Liverpool, which was a really derelict place. You had [theatre director] Ken Campbell\u2019s Illuminatus! trilogy opening there in 1976 \u2013 so much music, theatre, art, I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland. Having always felt like a bit of a misfit, suddenly I was surrounded by other misfits, and even though some of them were larger-than-life characters like Holly, Bill and Pete Burns, I weirdly fitted in. What were the Beatles like in 1964? All I remember is the sound of the screaming girls, me crying, sticking fingers in my ears. After the Lightning Seeds\u2019 first single, Pure, became a US Top 30 hit, you were asked to set up a US record label and suggested (in vain) that they sign Pulp and Oasis. How do you look back at Britpop now? I\u2019ve realised that the music press created this idea of a world that people really wanted to be in, which was exciting. It was like that with Britpop, as it was for punk rock \u2013 when I saw the Sex Pistols, they were good but they were nothing like they were written about. But that\u2019s OK. It\u2019s a bit like when you\u2019re watching a Marvel film and you suspend belief. You know those people can\u2019t really fly, but you enjoy the spectacle anyway. How was Britpop for you? Odd. I liken it to when I\u2019m on the train from Liverpool to London and there\u2019s part of the journey when you\u2019re running alongside the motorway watching the cars speed along. I felt I was moving alongside Britpop, not within it. The other bands were on a completely different track. Your paternal grandfather was a Latvian Jew who fled Cossack violence and ended up in Liverpool by accident, thinking he\u2019d been dropped off in New York. You received antisemitic abuse in the punk years. With your book published during the current Israel-Hamas war, how does it feel to think about that personal history? I don\u2019t feel connected to the current situation personally because I identify as a scouser, but of course I identify with how awful the situation is the same as everyone else. It\u2019s very upsetting to see the pictures. Like a lot of things in recent years, including the impact of Brexit, I feel like we\u2019re in an era where people can\u2019t control anything, which I\u2019ve never felt in my life before. I feel very lucky to be Liverpudlian within that, though, where the huge Chinese community feel like scousers, the Ukrainian taxi drivers feel like scousers. It\u2019s such a proudly multicultural, welcoming place. Historians have written about Three Lions crystallising a moment when England regained a sense of its own identity. What are your feelings about English nationalism? The FA never liked Three Lions because it was about England losing. It was about the masochism of losing being part of the journey of being a fan. It was also completely against lad culture, which was everywhere at the time \u2013 the \u201cfootball\u2019s coming home\u201d line was a reference to the Euros slogan, about football coming back to where it was invented, rather than any trophy returning. I\u2019ve had a tricky relationship with it, but I\u2019m at peace with it. The FA still don\u2019t like the song. They\u2019re trying to make Sweet Caroline England\u2019s song instead. The England football team didn\u2019t like the song either \u2026 No, but it was about how they never won! It was a bit awkward playing it back to them \u2013 we hadn\u2019t thought that through [laughs]. But Terry Venables liked it. I remember him jangling his keys along to it, smiling: \u201cIt\u2019s a proper key-tapper, Ian.\u201d Do you have any surprising heroes? Orson Welles. I love watching his interviews on YouTube. In one, he was asked if he\u2019d been in a situation where a friend wanted a part in one of his films, and he\u2019d given it to them, and if that had ever worked out well. \u201cNever,\u201d he replied. But he\u2019d done it lots, so was asked why. \u201cBecause I value people and friendship above art,\u201d he said. That\u2019s something to live by. You went through a very tough time in the 2000s \u2013 a divorce and four family deaths, including your parents, your sister, who had a brain tumour, and your brother, who killed himself. Did anything help you? For a long time I thought I\u2019d wasted my life doing music. I\u2019d sat worrying about a drum sound when I should have been out there, living. It took me a long time to realise that music is where I\u2019m happy living my life, like it or hate it \u2013 collaborating, playing with friends, sharing my songs. And I realised why I loved doing gigs \u2013 because you have different connections to different sets of people in different places every night. Your songs become alive again in lots of different ways. Your son, Riley, for whom you wrote your 1992 hit, The Life Of Riley, when he was a toddler, is now your manager and bandmate. That must be special. It is. When I\u2019m singing that song, and he\u2019s next to me on the stage, it\u2019s just something else. Every time. \u2022 Tomorrow\u2019s Here Today by Ian Broudie is published by Nine Eight Books (\u00a322). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

        "body": "When product designer Ben Watson went to his first ever craft fair in October, he didn\u2019t have great expectations. \u201cI thought it would be akin to a car boot sale, with retirement-age couples having a nose around to fill their Sunday,\u201d he says. Watson is part of Green Grads, a scheme that supports makers using recycled or waste materials. So the University of Northumbria student had already had his elegant lamps made from discarded vape cases displayed at Heal\u2019s furniture store in London and at Grand Designs Live, Birmingham. A stall at the Great Northern Contemporary Craft Fair (GNCCF) at Victoria Baths, Manchester, didn\u2019t seem like a big deal. \u201cSafe to say I was surprised at the huge variety of attendees, most of whom engaged with makers throughout the day, creating a buzzing atmosphere,\u201d he says. \u201cEach stall offered something wholly unique, which made walking the halls of the fair a real journey of discovery, never quite sure what\u2019s around the corner.\u201d A growing number of people are, like Watson, discovering the joys of going to or selling at craft fairs and makers\u2019 markets. Over that weekend in October, GNCCF 2023 attracted over 4,000 visitors. A 2019 Crafts Council report found that 34% of those who buy craft prefer markets, festivals and pop-ups to galleries or online purchases. The current craft revival started through TV and the internet \u2013 with shows like The Repair Shop and The Great Pottery Throwdown finding new audiences for artisan skills, and platforms such as Etsy opening a new marketplace for crafters \u2013 but now it\u2019s also about face-to-face sales and experiences. And, if it feels like event posters are everywhere at the moment, that\u2019s because this period is vital for the industry: many crafters generate more than 60% of their annual income in the run-up to Christmas. Nicky Dewar, learning &amp; skills director at the Crafts Council, says that what we consider as craft has widened in recent years and that has brought in a younger , more diverse audience. There has been an increase in shoppers aged under 35 buying craft, increasing from 17% (1.1 million) in 2006 to 32% buyers (9.1 million) in 2020. She says this age bracket also prefer to buy in markets rather than online. \u201cPlaces like the Truman Brewery Makers Market in London appeal to younger people,\u201d says Dewar. \u201cThere\u2019s something lovely about seeing markets pop up in so many different spaces. They\u2019re important for emerging businesses to try products and see what sells. It\u2019s a big step for traders.\u201d Sinead Koehler is the founder of Crafty Fox Market which holds events in unorthodox settings. She says there\u2019s been an explosion of specialist markets all over the country. \u201cWe started hosting markets in a Brixton pub in 2010 and we\u2019ve also sold at music festivals including Shambala and We Out Here,\u201d Koehler says. \u201cThis year, we\u2019ve worked with a number of cultural institutions, including a recent market in the foyer at the British Library.\u201d Homeware and clothing company Toast has 20 shops around the country, but the business has also put together a makers market in King\u2019s Cross, London, this Christmas. \u201cThe festive market provides a platform to showcase unique handcrafted gifts and decorations,\u201d says Suzie de Rohan Willner, CEO of Toast. \u201cWe hope it provides an opportunity to meet and talk directly to makers.\u201d The democratisation of markets doesn\u2019t find universal approval though. Annie Warburton is CEO of Cockpit Arts, a social enterprise that provides studio space and business advice for 160 creative businesses in London. Cockpit holds open studio events so the public can meet and buy from makers in their workplace. Warburton says that many craftspeople are wary of markets: \u201cThere can be a wide range of authenticity at these events. You could be buying from a novice or a trained artisan \u2013 quality can vary.\u201d Sinead O\u2019Connor has been involved in selling and running markets since 2015. She curates Artisan Markets Cornwall, with events in Truro, St Ives, Tregenna and Wadebridge. O\u2019Connor confirms there has been an increased interest in craft \u2013 the St Ives market is still rammed with visitors long after the summer season \u2013 but she cautions against traders selling \u201cdropshipped\u201d goods \u2013 items that are sourced rather than made by the vendor at markets. \u201cI find it heartening that a lot of customers ask: \u2018is it made by you?\u2019 The feeling I get is that people really want something that can\u2019t be bought from Amazon,\u201d she says. Dewar thinks this desire for authenticity is in part the legacy of lockdown. \u201cDuring the pandemic, lots of people did craft and we also really connected with our local communities as the world shut down.\u201d She still feels that bond with community and locality in craft markets. \u201cIf ceramics are inspired by a certain landscape which means something to you and something to the maker, you have a connection. That sort of craft is like the Couple\u2019s Choice dance on Strictly, it tells a story.\u201d Watson says he was delighted, if somewhat surprised, when he first made a sale at the GNCCF. \u201cMakers were far more enthusiastic to talk about their process than push a sale. It\u2019s great though \u2013 for consumers, it\u2019s never been easier to make mass-manufactured, next-day delivery purchases. It\u2019s heartwarming to see people in this country are prepared to support independent businesses.\u201d",

        "body": "In 2020, three months after his 100th birthday, Dorothy Wiggins\u2019 husband, Guy, died. They had been married for 61 years. \u201cWe never fought,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were always together. Without him, I was devastated by grief.\u201d Immediately after his death, alone in her West Village brownstone in New York, she filled her days by putting together a photo album of their life, but soon Wiggins started making trips into the city to figure out what to do next. One of her children, Noel, had previously commissioned his journalist friend Michael Astor to make a short film about his parents. Now he suggested that Astor could film his mother\u2019s day-to-day activities. It might help take her mind off her bereavement, he said, and Astor could use the footage to create a documentary about her life. A few months into the process, Astor began posting clips of Wiggins\u2019 Manhattan escapades on Instagram and TikTok. Petite, armed with a wooden staff and always dressed to the nines, Wiggins soon gained a following thanks to the uncompromising takes she came out with while marching about town. She expounds on everything from local dining hotspots to theatrical adaptations of classic musicals and the art of seduction. In one clip, she passionately explains the supposed health benefits of drinking wine with every meal. A year on from going live as @dorothylovesnewyork, the 98-year-old Wiggins now has close to 100,000 followers on Instagram. She is a social media star but in classic Wiggins fashion, she has an outspoken opinion on her newfound fame. \u201cI think cellphones are a great invention and have made life much easier for everybody but I think social media is stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople telling things about their lives to strangers is just a jerky thing to do. I\u2019m not a bit interested in it.\u201d While she doesn\u2019t approve of the influencer lifestyle or check Astor\u2019s posts, Wiggins does find joy in reading her fans\u2019 comments and encountering them on the street. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that people are inspired by my longevity and attitude,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to be a model and trained as an actor so I don\u2019t mind people seeing me or Michael filming me. New Yorkers are very blase \u2013 they don\u2019t make a big deal about it.\u201d Yet one post from the past year does stand out for her. \u201cNine million people watched my tennis serve and that thrilled me because tennis players are obsessive about the game,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen\u2019s champion Chrissie Evert even commented on it! I\u2019ll never stop playing.\u201d Although she and Astor film most days, Dorothy\u2019s life is largely unaffected by her social media fandom. She still has the same friends and sticks to the \u201csacred cocktail hour\u201d she would share each day with Guy, a landscape painter and diplomat (her drink of choice is a whiskey with ice, and a glass of water on the side). What Astor captures is the real thing. \u201cI\u2019ve always been very outspoken. If I don\u2019t like something, I will let people know that,\u201d she says. \u201cGuy and I would not take any crap from anybody.\u201d In fact, the greatest effect of Wiggins\u2019 social media stardom has been on her fans who are moved by her sense of vitality. \u201cI think of myself the same as I\u2019ve always done,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you say: \u2018I\u2019m old,\u2019 you act old and think old. I just don\u2019t think old. My personality is the same and people still seem to enjoy my company.\u201d There is no slowing Wiggins down. She will keep filming for the foreseeable future. \u201cThere is always a picture to be taken of me doing something,\u201d she says. \u201cGuy would be amused because I could barely get him to start using emails.\u201d Three years on from his death, Dorothy\u2019s grief has not gone away, but she has learned to live with it. \u201cWe had a magical life and it wasn\u2019t enough for me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut life carries on and it is never too late to keep up with the times and try something new.\u201d \u2022 Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",

        "body": "For over 50 years, David Hockney has been a dominant force in contemporary art. A new career-spanning show at the Honolulu Museum of Art brings the artist back to Hawaii for the first time in many years, with an exhibition of over 100 pieces in various media documenting Hockney\u2019s journey from the 1950s up through the pandemic years. \u201cWe were drawn to different time periods, and making sure we were representing earlier time periods, through to later and different media \u2013 the photo collages, the photographs of drawings, and iPad, iPhone, and other digital drawing,\u201d said Katherine Love, a co-curator of the show alongside Catherine Whitney, the museum\u2019s director of curatorial affairs. The Homa exhibition is a large, well-organized show, compellingly arranged on walls of bold red, blue and white, leading audiences on multiple journeys though Hockney\u2019s ever-evolving use of the visual form. Broken out into six sections, it begins with some of Hockney\u2019s earliest works, working its way up to digital paintings that he made via iPhone and iPad during the pandemic. One of its organizing principles are the multiple dualities that Love and Whitney observed in Hockney\u2019s work. \u201cOne thing we really wanted to play with in the dualities is the idea of interiors and exteriors,\u201d said Whitney. \u201cThere\u2019s also a sense of stillness and tension, and also balance and calm. There are just so many contrasting binaries in the work throughout his career. He has an incredible way of contrasting opposites in a celebratory way.\u201d David Hockney: Perspective Should Be Reversed, Prints from the Collections of Jordan D Schnitzer and His Family Foundation centers itself around an idea that Hockney, now 86, has pursued for years \u2013 that of upending perspective as it is typically pursued in western art. This can be seen in his breakthrough works with Polaroid snapshots, in which he built huge collages out of Polaroids, building scenes that had countless perspectives embedded in them. For Hockney, this is truer to how we perceive reality than a painting consisting of just a single vanishing point. It also speaks to Hockney\u2019s infatuation with integrating the latest technology into his artistic output, something that audiences can see throughout the exhibition. \u201cEven though he\u2019s experimenting with new technology and always trying new things, he\u2019s always aware of what happened in the past,\u201d said Whitney. \u201cAnd he\u2019s always interested in learning more about history and incorporating that into his work \u2013 sort of always moving beyond.\u201d In the painting Perspective Should be Reversed \u2013 a typically robust, inter-referential festival of individuals from Hockney\u2019s universe, miniatures of the artist\u2019s paintings, and a variety of different vanishing points \u2013 Hockney leaves a copy of TJ Clark\u2019s Picasso and Truth right out in front where it is hard to miss, indicating debts that he owes to the great Spaniard. In fact, one of this show\u2019s strengths is how ably it teases out many of the artistic links between the two. \u201cHockney has been really fascinated with Picasso and how he broke away from what was expected representationally,\u201d said Love. \u201cCubism did really experimental work with thinking about the use of space in different ways. Hockney is really interested in that same idea of how we perceive the world around us.\u201d As part of the Picasso theme, the Honolulu show includes two of Hockney\u2019s Polaroid collages, in which he pioneered his ideas of bringing cubism into the photographic realm. \u201cOne of the issues Hockney has with traditional photography is that it\u2019s from a static viewpoint,\u201d said Love. \u201cBut humans experience looking around the world \u2013 we can move our eyes. So how can you translate that experience into a picture?\u201d Multiple later works from the 2010s extend the ideas that he pioneered with these Polaroid collages \u2013 for instance, several see the artist honing his collage craft into photorealist offerings in which tables, chairs and hung canvases let Hockney embed countless perspectives, while doppelgangers of himself and other intimates proliferate. \u201cIt\u2019s this kind of constant play with reality,\u201d said Love. \u201cWhat is reality, what is perception, what is assumed, what is known, what is created? What can I make you see?\u201d Perspective Should Be Reversed also includes a satisfying selection of works that Hockney has made exclusively on iPhones and iPads, using his fingers and a stylus. These include many that Hockney has made of the English countryside over the years, among them some of his popular Woldgate works, in which the artist spent months meticulously chronicling the arrival of spring through dozens of drawings. For these and other late works, Hockney revels in bright, often surprising colors and intricate lines. \u201cSome of the late pieces, those late landscapes from Normandy with the rain on the pond, those are spectacular,\u201d said Love. \u201cI\u2019m a colorist, so I\u2019m kind of a sucker for anything that\u2019s bright and amazing, and that\u2019s why the Woldgate pieces really stunned me.\u201d Among the later works are standouts like Landscape with Shadows, a dazzling, cubist-inflected feast of colors, textures, and perspectives, and Rain on the Pond, which channels a solemn mood and includes innumerable raindrops beautifully bursting into rings on the titular pond. Although not quite as substantial-feeling or innovative as much of the earlier work in this show, these pieces are extremely pleasing, and offer a window into the current interests of a major figure in the art world. Perspective Should Be Reversed draws on the collection of Jordan Schnitzer, scion of a wealthy Oregon family, one of the state\u2019s leading real estate developers, and a longtime arts philanthropist. Schnitzer\u2019s collection of Hockney\u2019s work dates back decades, and the artist is among his most numerous holdings. \u201cI gives me great joy to bring the work here,\u201d said Schnitzer. \u201cThe collection allows a museum like this to get access to the best and biggest and brightest of the artist.\u201d All in all, the Jordan Schnitzer family foundation has helped organize over 180 exhibitions. Perspective Should Be Reversed is a true boon for Honolulu\u2019s vibrant art museum \u2013 which has done great work in bringing a variety of contemporary art voices out to the middle of the Pacific \u2013 and it should not be missed by residents of and visitors to the island alike. \u201cThis is probably the biggest print show ever that\u2019s been exclusively of Hockney,\u201d said Whitney, \u201cso that\u2019s pretty exciting. It\u2019s amazing to show works from 1954 right up to 2022. We\u2019re very thrilled to have it.\u201d David Hockney: Perspective Should Be Reversed is on display at the Honololu Museum of Modern Art in Hawaii until 10 March 2024",

        "body": "Your report quotes National Literacy Trust statistics showing that 8.6% of children do not own a book (Almost a million children in the UK do not own a book, 28 November). This was my own experience in the 1940s and 50s. However, both my mother and grandmother were regular readers. They did not own books, but used libraries. I was introduced to the local public library early on, and reading quickly became the centre of my life. I went on to become a librarian and worked in cooperation with national and international library organisations in later years after I became an academic. That so many children today do not own a book is disturbing, but it\u2019s just as bad, or worse, that their access to libraries is shrinking. A number of local libraries have been closed under pretty much every local authority, and book budgets are terribly constrained. This denies children the access to the enormous range of books that libraries have been able to offer in the past. Ownership of a few books is really no substitute for this. Prof Paul Sturges Stanton by Bridge, Derbyshire \u2022 Your reader\u2019s response (Letters, 28 November) to Polly Toynbee\u2019s article on the importance of the arts in schools reignited my profound gratitude to a young primary teacher with a guitar in the 1960s who inspired a bunch of us to experience the joy of harmonising with him to Sloop John B at lunchtimes.

        "body": "Those who oppose the return of the Parthenon marbles to Greece should see the remaining sculptures in the purpose-built Acropolis Museum in Athens, where \u2013 proudly displayed \u2013 they glow in the natural light for which they were created. Compare that with the British Museum\u2019s dreary presentation \u2013 lifeless specimens languishing out of context in a grey, windowless hall \u2013 and there\u2019s no question which is the better place for them. It is inconceivable that the British public care remotely as much for these marbles as the Greeks do \u2013 and imagine the joy, gratitude and benefit for our international reputation if we restored them to their home. The Greek prime minister\u2019s analogy of a Mona Lisa being cut in half is only partly correct (Parthenon marbles row raises fresh fears over fraught UK-EU relations, 28 November). Yes, the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts, and the marbles should be presented together, but they are more than a work of art \u2013 they are a Greek national icon, integral to the country\u2019s history and culture. It\u2019s as if the Greeks had stolen Nelson from his column and dumped him in a side room of Athens town hall. It is disingenuous of our government to protest that the law affecting the marbles is insurmountable, especially with its current attitude to migrant legislation. The British Museum surely has the wit to make good replicas for its display, but if you want to view these wonderful marbles at their best, see them in Athens. Richard O\u2019Brien Highbridge, Somerset \u2022 Here\u2019s a proposal: the government finds the money to commission Factum Arte to make exact replicas of the pieces at issue. The British Museum holds a blockbuster exhibition inviting the public to come and see if we can tell the difference (that will raise some much-needed money for the museum). Then the originals are shipped back to Greece, and ownership transferred back by an act of parliament, as is apparently legally required. And the replicas go on display in the British Museum in perpetuity \u2013 assuming, that is, the curators can tell the difference. Pam Lunn Kenilworth, Warwickshire \u2022 Rishi Sunak\u2019s refusal to meet the Greek prime minister because he\u2019d discussed the Parthenon marbles in a BBC interview is wrong and small-minded. We surely can do better than this. Lord Byron, in The Curse of Minerva, bemoans Lord Elgin\u2019s vandalism in removing them. The bicentenary of Byron\u2019s death is next year. What better way to mark it than return them to their rightful place? Then no longer would we \u201cin silent indignation mixed with grief, admire the plunder, but abhor the thief\u201d. Michael Wild Plymouth \u2022 Having amply demonstrated his lack of political nous in domestic affairs, is Rishi Sunak now working to show he can replicate this absence of skill set on the international stage? Rachel Chaloner Seacombe, Wirral \u2022 If the government can try to overrule the law by deporting migrants to Rwanda, surely it can also overrule the law and send the Parthenon marbles back to Greece. Tony Meacock Norwich \u2022 Make 10 copies of the Parthenon marbles on 3D printers, put one each in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, then send the rest on loan to schools and the originals back with apologies, like actual adults.

We\u2019d already written The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum), which I always thought was a potential follow-up to Ghost Town. Instead, it became our first single as Fun Boy Three. Terry Hall, our singer, came up with the name, which was deliberately ironic. We all shared an apartment in Notting Hill, London. We\u2019d watch football, I\u2019d strum my guitar and we\u2019d talk and talk. Then I\u2019d just leave Terry alone. He\u2019d smoke a cigarette and write some lyrics. Life under Margaret Thatcher had inspired the Specials\u2019 songs. With Lunatics, Terry wrote about nuclear war and the then US president Ronald Reagan, the idea being that the world was being run by lunatics. Forty years later, nothing\u2019s changed. We wanted a more percussive sound and built the song from the ground up, creating the rhythm using conga drums. Terry wrote the melody on a keyboard \u2013 he was so talented. At the time, everyone was starting to use electronic Linn drums and suchlike but the conga groove was almost Afrobeat. In the studio, Terry would sometimes do a guide vocal but then he\u2019d go back and do the vocals at five or six in the morning. He was a complex man. I often wonder whether being traumatised by abuse in childhood triggered his creativity. Before last Christmas, when Terry was dying, I was in Jamaica and dreamed about him, seeing his face when he was 17 and first joined the Specials. In my dream, I looked at him and said: \u201cYou look good, man.\u201d He never answered, smiled and was gone. Our box set was planned before he died: I hope it will give people a way to celebrate what a great and amazing artist he was. From now on, everything I do will be about remembering Terry. Neville Staple, backing vocals, percussion In the Specials, everything was going great \u2013 and then it wasn\u2019t. There were arguments about money and about tax, and we wanted to put our own ideas in, which we didn\u2019t feel able to. You don\u2019t think about whether it\u2019s a good idea to walk away from a very successful band who\u2019ve just had a No 1 single; you just want to go where there are fewer arguments. Our decision to leave was vindicated when the new group was accepted. For me, Fun Boy Three was something different. People always told us: \u201cYou lot look miserable.\u201d So the name was a play on that. Lunatics was the first song we wrote together. I\u2019d played percussion in bands before the Specials \u2013 with people like Ray King or Lieutenant Pigeon \u2013 so the change in sound, away from ska, was easy for me. Everyone joined in on percussion. The producer, Dave Jordan, got on great with us in the Specials and knew what we were like. So when we went for a new sound, he knew where we were coming from. On the first album, Terry found the Bananarama girls and got them in to sing with us. It wasn\u2019t just guys doing music. At the time, there was a lot of fighting everywhere, police doing stop and search. It felt like everyone was being watched, too, hence the lines, \u201cThey\u2019re watching every move we make / We\u2019re all included on their list.\u201d I always thought the first line, \u201cI see a clinic full of cynics\u201d, was about parliament. Reagan, global starvation \u2026 all the things in the lyrics were happening at the time. People were even making nuclear bunkers in their gardens. I suppose putting out a very political song as the first single was a bold statement but you don\u2019t think: \u201cWill we still be big?\u201d It\u2019s just what you want to do. Fun Boy Three don\u2019t get as much acclaim as the Specials but whenever I play festivals with my band, kids sing all the Specials songs and the Fun Boy Three ones as well. Whenever we were together, we were like family, so it\u2019s been a big shock losing Terry. Whenever I do Fun Boy Three songs, I always dedicate them to him. \u2022 The Complete Fun Boy Three, a CD and DVD box set, is out on Chrysalis. Neville Staple plays the Metronome, Nottingham, on 8 December, then tours.",

        "body": "Environmental lawyers have raised concern the offshore petroleum regulator is attempting to avoid scrutiny by not publishing its reasons for approving seismic blasting and drilling for a major fossil fuel development in northern Western Australia. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) granted approval for seismic testing and drilling of up to 10 wells for Woodside\u2019s $16.5bn Scarborough gas development last Friday. Woodside has approval to start drilling for the gasfield, which is estimated to cause between 880m and 1.6bn tonnes of emissions over its lifetime, from 13 December. The approvals were granted two months after the federal court overturned the regulator\u2019s earlier approval for seismic testing after finding Woodside had failed to properly consult traditional owners. The Environmental Defenders Office, which represented Murujuga traditional custodian Raelene Cooper in the federal court case, said it was concerned the regulator had not published a statement of reasons for either of its decisions last week. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Special counsel Clare Lakewood said although the regulator was not legally required to publish its reasons when it granted an approval, this had been its past practice. Information published in a statement of reasons for the earlier seismic testing approval led to Cooper launching her legal challenge. \u201cNopsema hasn\u2019t published its reasons for accepting either the seismic or drilling environment plans on the Nopsema website, which is a new approach, as previously statements of reasons have been made available at the time of the decision,\u201d Lakewood said. \u201cNopsema is not legally required to publish reasons when it accepts an environment plan, but it is alarming that it appears to be attempting to avoid scrutiny, when it has a recent history of making decisions that the courts have found are contrary to the law.\u201d A statement of reasons can be requested and the regulator has 28 days to publish it. Lakewood said this meant any seismic work could be well advanced before the reasons for the approval were available. A Woodside spokesperson said seismic testing had commenced and would be completed by 31 December. Cooper said: \u201cI want to know why Nopsema hasn\u2019t published their reasons for making this decision. \u201cThey need to publish them. It\u2019s in the interest of all people who have an interest in this project.\u201d Cooper said she remained concerned about the potential effects of seismic testing and drilling on marine species and on \u201csacred, significant songlines stretching from one end of the continent to the other\u201d. A Nopsema spokesperson said the environment plan for the seismic testing was subject to a \u201clengthy and rigorous\u201d assessment process and the regulator was satisfied it met the criteria for approval. They reiterated the regulator was not required to publish a statement of reasons and its \u201cpublished policy sets out how Nopsema considers publication of any statement of reasons, which is on a case-by-case basis\u201d. The spokesperson said the regulator had 28 days to comply if a statement of reasons was requested. The drilling approval allows for the drilling of eight wells with a contingency for two further wells. They said any further proposed drilling activity for the Scarborough development will require Woodside to submit a new environment plan or a proposed revision to the approved plan. The Scarborough project is one of two major offshore gas projects that have been delayed by legal challenges. Last year the federal court overturned a drilling approval for Santos\u2019 Barossa offshore gas project off the Northern Territory. Hearings in a separate legal challenge to a pipeline for that project commenced in Darwin this week. More than 30 organisations including Greenpeace, The Wilderness Society and Save Our Songlines, have written to the federal government urging it to strengthen Nopsema\u2019s regulations. The letter expresses concern about \u201caggressive lobbying\u201d by the gas industry in response to the court cases that found consultation with traditional owners had not been adequate. On Tuesday, Greenpeace activists scaled a 140-metre crane next door to Woodside\u2019s Perth headquarters, dropping a 25-metre banner reading \u201cStop Woodside\u201d. \u201cFossil fuel giant Woodside and its monstrous Burrup Hub gas project are not only Australia\u2019s biggest climate threat, but a huge threat to Australia\u2019s precious whales and wildlife,\u201d Greenpeace Australia Pacific chief executive David Ritter said. Woodside\u2019s spokesperson said the company was committed to \u201cplaying a significant role in the world\u2019s energy transition, through limiting our own emissions and reducing global emissions by supplying lower carbon energy to a world that needs it\u201d. \u201cWoodside will reduce Scarborough\u2019s direct greenhouse gas emissions to as low as reasonably practical by incorporating energy efficiency measures in design and operations,\u201d they said. They said Woodside had also set targets at Pluto, its liquefied natural gas processing facility, in line with company net zero targets by 2050.",

        "body": "More than 1,000 workers at Volkswagen\u2019s Chattanooga plant in Tennessee \u2013 the automaker\u2019s flagship US manufacturing site \u2013 have signaled they want to unionize, a significant early win in the United Auto Workers\u2019 latest attempt to expand its membership. The UAW announced on Thursday that over 30% of the plant\u2019s workforce had signed on in the first week. Once a majority signs union authorization cards, the UAW can file for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board. The move comes as the UAW aims to unionize nearly 150,000 workers at 13 auto plants in the wake of record contract gains at Ford, Stellantis and General Motors. Previous unionization efforts by the UAW at the Chattanooga have failed. In 2019, the UAW lost its second union election at the plant in a vote of 776 votes in favor of unionizing to 833 who voted against it. Ahead of the vote, elected Republican officials strongly opposed the unionization effort. Tennessee\u2019s Republican governor, Bill Lee, visited to discourage workers from supporting the union. In 2014, the union also lost an election, with 53% of workers voting against unionizing. Volkswagen had claimed to remain neutral during both elections, but outside anti-union groups and political leaders engaged in ad spending and campaigns to dissuade workers from voting in the union, and low-level supervisors reportedly participated in those efforts. \u201cPeople are standing up like never before,\u201d said Steve Cochran, a skilled team member and a leader of the workers building the union at Volkswagen. \u201cThere are a lot of young workers in the plant now, and this generation wants respect. They\u2019re not OK with mistreatment by management. They see what\u2019s happening at Starbucks and Amazon. They know that standing up to join the union is how you win fair treatment, fair pay and a better life.\u201d The UAW highlighted Volkswagen\u2019s $184bn profits over the past decade. Volkswagen vehicle prices have increased 37% over the last three years, but worker wages have lagged. \u201cI like working at VW, I\u2019m proud to make these vehicles, but I\u2019m not proud of the way we\u2019re treated,\u201d added Billy Quigg, a production team member in assembly at Volkswagen. \u201cThe forced overtime on Saturdays, the lack of time off \u2026 it keeps us away from our families. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building the union. When people have a good job and time to spend with our families, we\u2019ll help the whole community thrive.\u201d",

        "body": "20. See, Amid the Winter\u2019s Snow (1858) Without wishing to be sniffy about it, there are definitely better traditional carols out there than the stuff you hear every Christmas without fail. Whether rendered by a choir, or Annie Lennox on her 2010 album A Christmas Cornucopia, See, Amid the Winter\u2019s Snow has a beautiful tune, unflattened by overfamiliarity. 19. In Dulci Jubilo (1328) Forget Mike Oldfield\u2019s infuriatingly perky instrumental version \u2013 which enjoyed wide exposure as the theme to the TV series Fanny Cradock Cooks for Christmas, no less \u2013 and listen instead to In Dulci Jubilo sung at a slower tempo: it is strangely haunting and is improved immeasurably by not featuring a widdly-woo guitar solo. 18. The Little Drummer Boy (1941) Popularised in the 50s by the Trapp Family Singers \u2013 of The Sound of Music fame \u2013 and subsequently performed by everyone from Justin Bieber and Busta Rhymes to Terry Wogan and Aled Jones, The Little Drummer Boy lands just the right side of mawkish and twee and ends up rather touching. 17. It Came Upon the Midnight Clear (1849) You want the original US version of It Came Upon the Midnight Clear, rather than the 1874 European remix: the latter has a different (inferior) tune, the former is lilting, beautiful and has spawned umpteen latter-day versions from country (Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette) to jazz (Ella Fitzgerald). 16. Gaudete (1582) Not really a Christmas service singalong \u2013 lyrics in Latin presumably being beyond the tipsier attenders of midnight mass \u2013 Gaudete is best-known today in Steeleye Span\u2019s 1973 hit a cappella version. But banish the spectre of Alan Partridge playing the latter in his car: Gaudete is powerful and faintly ominous. 15. Ding Dong Merrily on High (1924) This is a secular tune, from a 16th-century book of French dances, repurposed. The lyrics are a bit showy \u2013 their author, George Ratcliffe Woodward, apparently \u201cdelighted in archaic poetry\u201d, which rather suggests he was the kind of person who uses the word \u201cmethinks\u201d in every day conversation \u2013 but no matter: the melismatic \u201cgloria\u201d provides suitable euphoria. 14. Good King Wenceslas (1853) If anything, the hagiography of Good King Wenceslas dials the story down a bit: in some accounts, Saint Wenceslas was out in the snow, barefoot, every night as an act of penance. The tune, a dependable source of bountiful good cheer, repurposes a 13th-century Easter carol. 13. God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen (c1650s) Regularly incorrectly punctuated \u2013 \u201cGod rest you merry\u201d is a Shakespearean phrase meaning \u201cGod grant you happiness\u201d \u2013 and these days performed with two verses excised (they just bang on about shepherds, we\u2019re not missing much), God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen is cheery and induces a warm glow, despite the complaints of an 1820s journalist, who called it \u201cdoggerel\u201d. Newspaper critics, eh? 12. We Three Kings (1857) A winning combination of sombre verses with a big old chorus, and intrigue provided by the arrival in verse four of Balthazar, whose explanation of his gift seems only to make matters worse: \u201cMyrrh is mine, its bitter perfume breathes a life of gathering gloom\u201d. Oh, how lovely and, just out of interest, did you keep the receipt? 11. O Holy Night (1843) French in origin but big in the US \u2013 English language lyrics about slavery were popular with abolitionists \u2013 O Holy Night isn\u2019t sung as often as its melody warrants, apparently because it\u2019s too difficult, requiring a wide vocal range. Check out Etta James\u2019s admirably understated version to hear how it should be done. 10. Silent Night (1818) Silent Night can sound like a dirge, as anyone who has heard it rendered by the year 4 violin group at a school Christmas concert can attest, but there is something beautiful about its images of tranquility, particularly when you know it was written in the aftermath of a war. Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s version peels away the overfamiliarity. 9. Carol of the Bells (1919) Best known today from the soundtrack of Home Alone, Carol of the Bells hails from Ukraine and the insistence of its four-note ostinato vocal effectively conjures up a sense of anticipation. The most radical modern version is Wynton Marsalis\u2019s jazz take, which swings the melody, making it sound, bizarrely, lubricious. 8. The Holly and the Ivy (c1814) A traditional English song much older than its first publication date, it is tempting to suggest The Holly and the Ivy is better heard sung by a folk singer than a choir (it has been performed by Eliza Carthy and Steeleye Span among others): they tend to change the rhythm, making it less perky and posh, more frostbitten. 7. Joy to the World (1719) The Ed Sheeran of carols: it was English but broke the US in no uncertain terms, despite repeated complaints that it was nicking other people\u2019s music (it is the US\u2019s most published carol and most published hymn, but is, shall we say, \u201cheavily influenced\u201d by Handel). Its appeal lies in infectiously full-on hands in the air optimism. 6. O Come, O Come, Emmanuel (1861) Possibly the oldest carol here, with its roots in eighth- or ninth-century monastic singing, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel is, strictly speaking, an Advent hymn that\u2019s been co-opted for Christmas. The most popular latter-day melody, first used in the 19th century, is incredibly beautiful, lending itself to modern interpretations by indie bands and Enya alike. 5. Hark! The Herald Angels Sing (1739) Some carols were clearly intended to create a contemplative space in which we are invited to consider the wonder of the Nativity, others were just designed to be belted out at maximum volume. Hark! The Herald Angels Sing is definitely in what you might describe as the Mot\u00f6rhead category. 4. Coventry Carol (1534) This is the killer deep cut of carols. Eerie folk melody plus lyrics crammed with misery and woe, it\u2019s not about the Nativity, but the Massacre of the Innocents, sung from the despairing point of view of a new mother. Emotionally wrenching, even disturbing, you can see why it has ended up in the file marked \u201cuse sparingly\u201d. 3. The First Noel (c16th/17th century) Hailing from Cornwall, and quite possibly 300 years older than the estimate above, the latter-day iteration of The First Noel is all about the slow build and the spectacular climax: it starts out relatively hushed, concentrating on the humility of the shepherds, but by its conclusion, it is all guns blazing and irresistibly uplifting. 2. In the Bleak Midwinter (1904) Adapted by Gustav Holst from a poem by Christina Rossetti, this is the all-time classic gloom-laden carol. Without wishing to diminish its spiritual message, or the sighing loveliness of its music, perhaps its grimness \u2013 poverty, austerity, people moaning about the weather \u2013 speaks to our tacit acceptance of the melancholy that lurks behind Christmas\u2019s tinselly facade. 1. O Come, All Ye Faithful (1744) There is no point in pretending that the No 1 slot in this list is founded on anything other than personal preference, but really, having trudged your way through Silent Night and done your best with the treacly Away in a Manger, whose heart doesn\u2019t lift a little at the opportunity to belt out O Come, All Ye Faithful, with its chorus full of mounting dynamics, its appealingly weird line about not abhorring the virgin\u2019s womb and its showstopper ending? Beware the sherry-emboldened amateur vocalist who takes it on themselves to attempt the elaborate harmonies in the final verse.",

        "body": "It may be too late to save for the festive season, but it is still possible to ignore the marketing hype and reduce spending, which will be better for the planet and your pocket. Frugal experts share their advice on how to save money this Christmas. Limit your exposure to unreal expectations of Christmas \u201cThere are ways that you can embrace all of the joy, warmth and connection of Christmas without creating a really difficult financial situation for yourself,\u201d says Clare Seal, the author of Five Steps to Financial Wellbeing and creator of the Instagram account @myfrugalyear, who lives in Bath. One way that Seal does this is by avoiding social media accounts that offer too much temptation. \u201cChristmas used to be about which family had the best lights on their house,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now we can see inside people\u2019s homes on social media and we have got a really distorted perception of how much stuff people are buying because influencers are quite often gifted lots of stuff.\u201d The solution? \u201cIf you have a problem with spending when you are exposed to these things, the best thing that you can do is to remove all of that noise. Mute or unfollow accounts that trigger envy or comparison. Unsubscribe from marketing emails. The carrot for signing up is that you get a discount: create a separate email account that you only look at when you specifically decide that you want to.\u201d Don\u2019t throw money at the problem \u201cSometimes I buy things just so I can close the tab on my phone,\u201d admits Seal. The increased mental load in December means \u201cthere are so many decisions to be made, so much Christmas admin to do\u201d and it can be easy to throw money at the problem so that it is one less thing to worry about. \u201cQuite often, I think we spend money so that we can file things under done,\u201d she says. Consider group presents This is ingenious. \u201cFor each household,\u201d says Seal, \u201cwe will put together a little box of gifts. For my husband\u2019s father and stepmother, we have included our kids\u2019 school photos, a Percy Pig decoration and a bottle of mead, so everyone individually has been thought of, but it is a lot more cost effective and less time consuming.\u201d Try a Secret Santa Seal is a fan of doing Secret Santa for family members so you just buy and receive \u201cone great present, rather than lots of token gifts\u201d. Ken and Mary Okoroafor of financial blog The Humble Penny and authors of Financial Joy: Banish Debt, Grow Your Money and Unlock Financial Freedom in 10 Weeks are also on board with this: \u201cIt is helpful for making sure everybody gets something that was thought about intentionally,\u201d says Ken. Reject the notion that \u2018it isn\u2019t Christmas without \u2026\u2019 \u201cWe have an internal checklist of things that we think we have to do for it to be festive,\u201d says Seal. \u201cGo to a Christmas market or have a turkey \u2013 they are quite false or manufactured things. You don\u2019t have to do all of those things for it to be a lovely Christmas.\u201d Seal\u2019s family will be having chicken this year \u201cbecause it was a fraction of the price of a turkey of the same weight and no one will complain \u2013 our children probably like that better,\u201d she says. Budget for festive spending throughout the year This is something Seal tries to do, where possible, \u201cstarting in February, because January is always tricky, and ending in November. Then the money is there to be spent.\u201d If you haven\u2019t saved this year, start asap in 2024. \u201cHold on to this feeling of discomfort that you have with the cost of Christmas and get it set up for next year,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to spend much at Christmas, you might get compared to Scrooge or the Grinch.\u201d There is the perception that \u201cChristmas should be when everything goes out of the window, but obviously you have to recover from that afterwards.\u201d Choose useful gifts The Okoroafors live in Dartford, Kent and have two boys who are eight and nine. \u201cWe ensure that their gifts have plenty of variety,\u201d says Mary. \u201cWe give them something to wear, something to read and something to play or create with.\u201d They have not done stockings \u2013 as stocking fillers quickly add up \u2013 but might introduce them this year with items like deodorant, a toothbrush and skincare products. The adult Okoroafors tend not to buy gifts for each other, saving that for birthdays. Have a potluck Christmas dinner Ken and Mary are hosting this year and will have 25 guests. Instead of paying for the whole meal themselves, everyone will bring a dish, from turkey to jollof rice, sharing the workload and the cost. They suggest making a list and sticking to it when food shopping to avoid festive novelties that can slip into the trolley: \u201cFor people who get distracted by all the shiny items on the shelves we recommend online shopping,\u201d says Mary. Reuse and recycle From wreaths to decorations \u2013 \u201cthey\u2019ve been the same since before we got married,\u201d says Ken \u2013 the Okoroafors recycle as much as possible. A few years ago they invested in a \u00a3100 reusable tree, which should last for years. If you do want to buy decorations, the best time is just after Christmas when they are on sale, says Mary. Try DIY Christmas cards, wrapping and presents Since the Okoroafors\u2019s boys were toddlers, they have made their own Christmas cards. \u201cThey are more special and their grandparents keep them,\u201d says Mary. Alternatively you could not bother sending them at all. \u201cThe postage is wild,\u201d says Ellie Austin-Williams, a financial coach and writer who lives in Clapham. Her debut book Money Talks: A Lifestyle Guide to Financial Wellbeing is out in January. Her grandad has a subscription to a virtual cards service, which is a fraction of the price, \u201cand he sends them to everybody for every occasion\u201d. Likewise, wrapping paper is a waste; recycle or use newspaper or brown paper, she says. \u201cThink creatively about how you can present gifts and don\u2019t spend loads of money just to make them look perfect.\u201d The Okoroafors like a burlap bag tied with a ribbon that can be reused endlessly. Seal makes edible gifts, such as chocolate orange fudge. Remember, it is truly the thought that counts It is easier said than done, says Austin-Williams, but \u201cit\u2019s not always about the value of what you are giving. It is about the time and the effort \u2013 the presents that are most valuable, or the things that people really remember, are not the things that cost the most money. And there are lots of things you can give that don\u2019t cost money,\u201d such as vouchers for babysitting or help in the garden, or arranging to go out with friends instead of buying them a present. What if someone gets you a more expensive gift than you can afford to give them? Honesty is the best policy, says Austin-Williams. \u201cYou can be really grateful for it, but also say \u2018I hope you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m not in a position to be able to spend loads of money\u2019 and think about ways you can repay them with gratitude or time.\u201d If you are struggling with debt, get help If you are entering the festive period with problematic debt, seek advice before you start spending more. \u201cReach out to a debt charity,\u201d says Austin-Williams, \u201csuch as StepChange or National Debtline and get some professional support, because it can be really overwhelming and stressful if you are in that situation.\u201d Be honest about your financial constraints \u201cIf you\u2019re not at that point but you have got debt, try to be honest about the financial situation that you are in,\u201d says Austin-Williams. \u201cSpeak to friends and family about the kind of constraints that you have, and the reality of what you are able to spend. I think we get a false idea in our head of the expectations that people have for our spending, whether it\u2019s on food, socialising, or presents. If you open up and say, \u2018I don\u2019t have the space for that in my budget\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m struggling a bit this month, could we do something else?\u2019, then you will see that people just want to spend time with you and don\u2019t necessarily care about the actual activity. If you\u2019re honest, I think a lot of the time people are happy to adjust plans and to work within your budget, but you\u2019ve got to tell them that you\u2019ve got that budget and those constraints.\u201d Chances are most people are in the same boat. Seal says the cost of living crisis is a good icebreaker: \u201cAn awkward conversation is so much better than getting your credit card bill in February and having no idea how you\u2019re going to pay it off.\u201d Avoid pointless purchases Austin-Williams has a two-month-old baby, for whom she will not be buying any presents because he will barely be conscious of them \u2013 and there is plenty of time to buy kids presents at Christmas. \u201cHe will probably get a couple of things from grandparents.\u201d But she will indulge in a personalised decoration for him, \u201cbecause that will last for ever.\u201d Don\u2019t overcommit \u201cIt is so easy to say yes to everything,\u201d says Austin-Williams. \u201cI\u2019ve done it and then you end up with a packed schedule, exhausted and with no money.\u201d Because she has a newborn, she will be doing most Christmas socialising at home this year. \u201cWe are having people over for mince pies and drinks and just catching up that way. I think everybody is feeling the stretch a little bit.\u201d Make your own traditions Alexandra Stedman, who is editor of the Frugality, will be having mac and cheese on Christmas Day in north London with her young children (three and five) who wouldn\u2019t appreciate a big sit-down meal anyway. Rather than sticking to tradition, just think about what you actually enjoy, she says. For her family that is \u201cwatching a film and having some canap\u00e9s from Aldi.\u201d There is a need to re-evaluate some family traditions to make sure Christmas is affordable \u2013 and Ken Okoroafor advises some frank conversations: \u201cAsk \u2018what are our traditions? Are there things we can change this year?\u2019 And everyone can agree and move on.\u201d Hopefully! Be organised \u201cI swear by lists,\u201d says Stedman. \u201cWhen you are hiding presents it can be tempting to go and get a little bit more,\u201d but a list can help prevent this. Stedman strictly buys one present per person and doesn\u2019t buy for relatives if she is getting gifts for their kids. She recommends asking people what they want \u2013 there is no shame in getting them something that they will actually appreciate and use. Shop in real life This saves on shipping costs, says Stedman, and you can check if the present is any good, which isn\u2019t always obvious when internet shopping, plus \u201cbuying online is soul destroying,\u201d she says. Try to get on board with re-gifting \u201cIf it is something that you know someone else will love,\u201d says Stedman, \u201cthen that is absolutely fine. I would be fine with knowing that something was re-gifted to me because we have all got to think like that and be a bit more circular. We have to re-train our brains and how we think about gifting.\u201d Don\u2019t forget the true meaning of Christmas No, it isn\u2019t all about matching pyjamas. \u201cIt\u2019s such a cliche to think about the thought and the love, but it\u2019s important to keep that at the front of your mind,\u201d says Stedman.",

        "body": "The romcom is as indestructible as a cockroach: a thousand reports of its impending demise have been matched by a thousand reports of its sudden resurgence. At this stage, it\u2019s safe to say the genre will outlive us all. That\u2019s partly because the romantic comedy is powered by a problem that will never be resolved: the glorious headache that is falling in love. Smothered, the riotous new show from bestselling author and Schitt\u2019s Creek writer Monica Heisey, takes this eternal affliction and tangles it up with a very modern complication. Things begin traditionally enough: Tom (boy) meets Sammy (girl) and, after the requisite period of dithering, the pair fall head over heels in love. And then Sammy discovers that Tom loves someone else more than he will ever love her. That someone is Ellie, his six-year-old daughter. Smothered could have created a compelling drama mined from all this knotty emotional complexity. Instead, Heisey and her team have moulded it into an irreverent comedy full of fast-paced farce and sparkling dialogue. Funny, fun-loving 26-year-old Sammy \u2013 played with madcap motormouth energy by Danielle Vitalis (Attack the Block, The Great Escaper) \u2013 initially seems an unlikely match for Tom (Jon Pointing, last seen in Big Boys), a wet wipe-carrying thirtysomething ground down by fatherhood. (\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a treat in about six years,\u201d he tells Sammy dolefully during their first encounter; when he finally does get to have a big night out, he is forced to flee the club half-cut to deal with a vomit-based childcare emergency.) But in true romcom tradition, those flying sparks mean the pair\u2019s differences eventually go up in smoke. All that remains is the little-girl-shaped stumbling block that forces the pair to press pause \u2013 or fast-forward \u2013 on their feelings. Like every romantic comedy ever made, Smothered\u2019s success hinges on a particular science: good chemistry between the lead actors. Vitalis was an early shoo-in for Sammy, although she didn\u2019t realise it at first: \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me that I had the part!\u201d, she recalls. Subsequently she read with \u201c12, maybe 13\u201d different Toms. As for Pointing, after his auditionhe gave up all hope of landing the role. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything for ages. A month later my mate was like, \u2018Can you give me a hand with this audition?\u2019 And it was the script [for Smothered]. I was like: OK, I\u2019ve not got that then. And I went round his house and helped him with my part.\u201d Did Vitalis feel Pointing was the standout choice to play her love interest? \u201cWhat can she say to that?!\u201d interrupts Pointing. (Fair point.) It turns out, however, that it wasn\u2019t the audition itself that sealed the deal, but the moment just before, when Vitalis found Pointing watching This Morning in the waiting room and the pair struck up a conversation about a viewer\u2019s noise pollution problem. \u201cAnd that was it from there,\u201d says Vitalis. \u201cWe had quite a natural banter with each other just as people.\u201d That banter \u2013 relentless, effervescent, teasingly combative \u2013 is also what rocket-powers Smothered itself, a show that combines giddy, heart-eyed rom with hectic, biting com to enchanting effect. Tom is the straight man, a quietly thrilled and occasionally deadpan foil for Sammy, a filterless font of cheeky charm, indignant rage and really good jokes. Scarred by a stream of bad dating experiences, she initially insists the pair embark on a short-lived affair, \u201clike a real one, from the past \u2013 no last names, no details, at the end we just walk in different directions on a bridge or something\u201d. Their brief dalliance does not conclude in such a suave and dignified manner, but it slowly flowers into a real, meaningful and gratifyingly imperfect bond. But before all that, the show indulges in some old-school rom-com mechanics. Londoners Sammy and Tom\u2019s paths initially cross when they strike up a conversation at a karaoke bar. Heisey was keen to embrace that old-school dramatic device \u2013 \u201cit would have been a bit of a shame to have them swiping on each other\u201d \u2013 yet soon realised that our app-driven dating culture had bestowed the \u201cmeet cute\u201d cliche with a kind of fairytale quality. \u201cMeeting someone in the wild and having it work out is increasingly fantastical for a lot of people,\u201d says Heisey. \u201cThe big fantasy is: a man talks to you at a bar and you\u2019re excited about it!\u201d Sammy and Tom\u2019s relationship may begin dreamily, but it quickly smashes into cold, hard reality when they attempt to refashion themselves as a blended family. Like many prospective stepchildren, Tom\u2019s daughter, Ellie, is not at all happy when Sammy comes on the scene. Did the team ever worry about treating her trauma too flippantly? Vitalis thinks \u201cone of the best ways to deal with serious subjects is through comedy\u201d, while Heisey says that a certain glibness was partly the point: \u201cSammy is our way into the story and she feels quite flippant about it, so the journey of season one is Sammy realising that she can\u2019t quite joke away the problem of this kid.\u201d Pointing, for his part, was delighted to discover Tom was a father. The actor doesn\u2019t have children of his own and was excited to be \u201cleaning into the \u2018practical dad\u2019 role \u2013 windbreaker, school bag, you know\u201d. Over the past few years, Pointing has carved out a niche in British comedy with his superlative line in hyperactive himbos with hidden depths (see his excellent work on Channel 4\u2019s Big Boys and the criminally underrated BBC Three YouTuber satire Pls Like). Yet, at 36, he relished the chance to become what he refers to as \u201cMr Serious\u201d. Vitalis \u2013 who will only say she is in her 30s \u2013 was also glad of the opportunity to play an adult. \u201cOften we get young people that are maybe in the education system and so it was nice to feel like I\u2019m every woman.\u201d Despite growing up in Toronto, Heisey \u2013 who is now UK-based \u2013 says she has always been enamoured by the British romcom, from the Richard Curtis classics (Smothered is punctuated by a recurring reference to Love Actually) to recent TV takes such as Catastrophe and Starstruck. For Heisey, the appeal of British comedy is that \u201cso much of it is about what\u2019s not being said\u201d. Pair that with our \u201cendlessly fascinating and strange\u201d dating culture, and you get a romcom tradition that is not about \u201cthe big speeches or people who are really turning on the flirt \u2013 it\u2019s people struggling towards expressing that they care about each other\u201d. The team also took inspiration from the hit American movies of the 80s and 90s that did so much to warp millennial expectations of love. Before filming commenced, Heisey invited Vitalis and Pointing over to watch her favourite film of all time, When Harry Met Sally. \u201cWe got pizza and we loved all the jumpers in the movie and we were like: this is the vibe \u2013 we just want loads of jumpers,\u201d recalls Vitalis (she did end up wearing some nice jumpers). For Heisey, the movie \u201cperfectly captures what a great romcom has, which is that watching it feels the same way that the world feels when you\u2019re falling in love: everything is 15% more charming and 15% more beautiful and 15% more colourful, and that was what I was hoping we could go for with Smothered as well.\u201d Heisey has undoubtedly succeeded in her goal: as the backdrop to Sammy and Tom\u2019s captivatingly chaotic courtship, south-east London has never looked more beautiful. Tempering the glowing sentimentality of US romcoms with British reticence and realism was one of the big challenges of making the show \u2013 but it\u2019s also an everyday struggle for Heisey. \u201cAs a North American expat in the UK, I think finding the right level of sentiment to not alienate yourself from your friends and loved ones is crucial,\u201d she says with a smile. The team found themselves bringing things back down to earth in an aesthetic sense, too. When Heisey visited the set of Sammy\u2019s \u201ctoo nice\u201d house share, she requested the walls be painted to look damp and the radiators adorned with drying pants (\u201cwe didn\u2019t want it to be like Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary where she lives in Borough Market on a publishing salary by herself\u201d). Sammy works as an assistant to an interior designer, which is the perfect romcom job: adjacent to luxury and glamour, without being drenched in it. Tom is not so lucky. \u201cI got demoted several times,\u201d says Pointing. \u201cThe first time I read the script, he was a lawyer. By the time we\u2019re shooting, he works for a supermarket magazine. I don\u2019t know, maybe I just don\u2019t give lawyer?\u201d One upside of his demotion is that Tom gets some cracking colleagues: flamboyant Jordan, played by the Instagram-famous character comedian Harry Trevaldwyn, and straight-talking Mims (Tessa Wong). On Sammy\u2019s side of the obligatory romcom friendship divide, we have her housemates, the chilled AJ (Amber Grappy) and Farrah, an incredibly funny and slightly terrifying turn by Rebecca Lucy Taylor, AKA the musician Self Esteem. Sammy is also working for swaggering, sharp-tongued restaurateur Gillian (a brilliant performance from the comedian Aisling Bea). As it turns out, Gillian has a bigger role in the series than you might initially imagine, a twist that genuinely caught me off guard (Heisey looks delighted when I tell her this). It\u2019s not the only pleasingly unexpected aspect of this bracingly contemporary spin on a classic genre: for all its embrace of the cosy tropes and cosy jumpers, Smothered is proof the romcom can still surprise us, even after all these years. \u2022 Smothered is on Sky Comedy and Now.",

        "body": "In early November, the nice woman at the checkout of my local Sainsbury\u2019s pointed out a nearby stack of Baileys. \u201cJust \u00a310 a bottle,\u201d she said, with a cheery wink. \u201cProper bargain.\u201d I smiled thinly. She clearly had no idea what sort of a person I am. Baileys? In November? Don\u2019t be so disgusting. Baileys is for Christmas. The annual bottle comes into my house on 20 December and not a day earlier. Because Christmas is a time for traditions, and the pre-Christmas bottle of Baileys is one of mine. I am stone-cold certain it is exactly what the Baby Jesus would have wanted. Why? Because I say so. The word \u201ctradition\u201d is solid and reassuring; the things that word refers to are often rather less so. To mix our cultural references, the point is best made by Tevye in the opening song to Fiddler on the Roof. \u201cYou may ask, how did this tradition start?\u201d he says, having introduced the audience to his fellow villagers. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you \u2013 I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s a tradition.\u201d Indeed it is. I was told a lovely story recently about an adult daughter who, taking on the mantle of Christmas food prep from her mother, went to the considerable trouble of sawing the end off the ham\u2019s bone before boiling it, just as her mother had always done. The mother asked her daughter why she had bothered. The daughter cited family tradition. At which point the mother explained that she\u2019d only ever got out the tools because she didn\u2019t have a pan big enough for the ham, unless she sawed off the bone. We may want tradition to be mystical and ancient but in truth it\u2019s all just a sweet confection. Take turkey. Really, take it. For many decades, until shamelessly subversive food writers came along with their fancy alternatives to the big bird, serving a turkey on Christmas Day was as important a part of the festivities as little donkeys and believing in the virgin birth. And yet as the food historian Dr Annie Gray points out, it was Dickens\u2019s A Christmas Carol which established the bird\u2019s primacy. \u201cBefore that, while turkey was popular, beef was far more so. The working classes had goose and the upper classes had more than one sort of meat.\u201d Then Dickens presented an ideal of the feast, while glossing over a significant problem. The poor Cratchits wouldn\u2019t have had an oven in which to roast the gift that Scrooge had given them. Like the rest of the community, they would have relied upon the baker to roast their bird and by Christmas morning the baker would have shut up shop. Oi! Scrooge, mate! What are we supposed to do with this huge bloody turkey? We should not see any of this as undermining our sense of tradition. We should see it as liberating. Because if tradition is exactly what we say it is, then like my bottle of Baileys \u2013 other Irish cream liqueurs might be available, but why would you? \u2013 we can just invent our own. And they can be as mad and as, well, untraditional as we like. Do you want to mark the arrival of Christmas by knocking up quinoa and avocado tacos? They sound truly awful but it\u2019s your Christmas, not mine. Go for it. Why not serve a beef rendang, or fire up the pizza oven and bake a margherita with the nativity scene lovingly depicted in tomato sauce and grated cheese, or whip up a vat of butterscotch Angel Delight for dessert? And if anybody asks you why, just stare at them in disbelief. Then whisper, because it\u2019s Christmas. And it\u2019s a tradition.",

        "body": "In the final moments of Stephen Spielberg\u2019s 2001 film AI: Artificial Intelligence, android boy David brings his \u201cmother\u201d Monica back to life for a single, bewildering day. People think this scene is sentimental, but it actually underlines the film\u2019s dark central point: David can never be a real boy, and the bizarre and cruel resurrection of Monica only reinforces his intrinsic inhumanity. This came to mind on Thursday night, as I snuck in late to Melbourne Symphony Orchestra\u2019s \u201cconcert in hologram\u201d with legendary soprano Maria Callas. I wasn\u2019t the only one late. Callas died in 1977, and she appears here via \u201ccutting-edge holographic technology\u201d, according to the program. The hologram \u2013 which uses projectors and motion capture technology to create a 3D image of Callas \u2013 interacts with the audience without speaking directly to us; she motions to conductor Daniel Schlosberg, who motions back. She pauses for applause even after any real applause has died off. It\u2019s a gimmick, of course \u2013 highly complicated technically, cobbled and reconstituted and projected into almost seamless life. We are meant to be charmed, and yet I found it not just unsettling but profoundly depressing. Callas was most famous for her fulsome emotional connection to her material, an ability to marry musical phraseology and fine vocal technique to psychological verisimilitude. Her performances were, above all, soulful, deeply humanist; she was loved because we saw ourselves in her. Callas the Copy is the inverse of this, an ersatz simulacrum of a long dead diva \u2013 a most callous Callas. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads The voice is there, mercifully. Callas\u2019s richness of tone, her dazzling range, that ability to make virtuosity seem a perfectly natural emanation of the self, fills Hamer Hall with conviction. So much so that you can almost trick yourself into believing she\u2019s present. But the lip-synching technology, and the faintly blurry figure itself, create an uncanny valley that resists full immersion. The energy in the room is not just muted, it\u2019s moribund. The MSO musicians were shrouded in shadow, and Callas shone in the centre of the stage like a precious stone. Arriving after the show had started, I had the uncomfortable sensation that the rest of the audience were also a simulation; that I\u2019d somehow stepped into a computer program or virtual reality display. Watching Callas through other people\u2019s phones seemed more satisfying to me than looking at the stage, in a strange loop of unreality. Maybe this grappling with the insubstantial is just a teething problem with the tech. These kinds of virtual performance are only on the rise, from ABBA\u2019s Voyage in the UK to Kiss\u2019s just announced \u201cimmortal avatars\u201d, coming soon. Perhaps this kind of performance will improve enough for us to forget how weird and monstrous it all is. But a part of me hopes not. It\u2019s one thing for us to luxuriate in nostalgia for the things we\u2019ve lost \u2013 to spend whole weekends listening to recordings of Callas\u2019s finest arias, for example \u2013 but to trick ourselves into thinking we\u2019re progressing boldly into the future by indulging in gimmickry seems dangerous to me. My response may seem like the quaint ravings of a luddite in no time at all. But one of the key elements of opera that gives it such power is the physical presence of the singer in the room, the way an extraordinary artist can move you with the vibrations of their voice. Deluding ourselves that a hologram \u2013 even when they become so lifelike they\u2019re indistinguishable from the real thing \u2013 can ever replace actual artists can only lead to further decline of an artform that\u2019s already dying off. We might, like David recreating Monica for his own emotional entertainment, use the greats of the past as our future playthings. The one thing we won\u2019t be able to resurrect is our own humanity. Maria Callas: A Concert in Hologram will travel to the Dunstan Playhouse in Adelaide on 9 December and Perth Concert Hall on 13 December",

        "body": "Branden Jacobs-Jenkins invites you to look. The playwright, a two-time Pulitzer prize finalist and MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d fellow, is marking his Broadway debut with the return of his acclaimed play Appropriate, back in New York nearly 10 years after its premiere. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of an amazing experience. It\u2019s so rare to have something that you\u2019ve done get a glow-up,\u201d Jacobs-Jenkins told the Guardian in a phone interview. With an all-star ensemble including Sarah Paulson and Elle Fanning, Appropriate follows the bitter Lafayette siblings as they reconvene at the home of their recently departed patriarch. While clearing out their childhood home, a former Arkansas plantation, they uncover a kaleidoscope of family secrets. Though set in 2010, the play is itself a living, punctual work. Bigoted characters, particularly the children, are given additional meaning in a post-Trump administration world. The play is about the act of looking back, of witnessing. The Lafayette siblings, and their children, each take turns looking at, squirming at and attempting to hide their family history. But for Jacobs-Jenkins, the play, especially a decade on, has ushered in a personal reflection on how his life and artistry has evolved. Directed by Lila Neugebauer, a friend of Jacobs-Jenkins since 2013, Appropriate invites Jacobs-Jenkins to trace his own journey, which he recounts with an enthralling, sincere and detailed spirit. Amid many life developments, parenthood proves to be one of the biggest changes for Jacobs-Jenkins, now a father to a three-year-old. \u201cI understood the siblings, the parents, in a deeper way,\u201d Jacobs-Jenkins said. \u201cJust having had the experience of what it is to love an innocent, unknowing, new human being so deeply.\u201d Additional time with the material has also allowed him to tackle storylines that his younger, 27-year-old self simply ran out of time to address. But overall, amid a bushel of accolades, Jacobs-Jenkins said the biggest shift career-wise had been the ability to fully embrace himself as an artist. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped needing to ask for permission, honestly, stopped wanting to ask for permission,\u201d Jacobs-Jenkins said. Appropriate is many things. It is a family drama. It is a hilarious allegory. Like much of Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s work, Appropriate includes a command of bold imagery and language, where characters treat inherited violence with a searing casualness but also as a ticking bomb. All these elements have become part of Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s signature, yet evolving, style. Across a bounty of plays, Jacobs-Jenkins has dissected identity, tribalism and broader questions of humanity with anthropologic precision. His work attempts to \u201cstimulate people into a greater understanding of who they were and what they were\u201d, he said. Of his influences, he counts \u201ceverything happening off-off-Broadway [in] the 70s and 60s,\u201d including work by the playwrights Sam Shepard and Adrienne Kennedy. He is also deeply affected by a litany of Black visual artists: Kerry James Marshall, Glenn Ligon and Adrian Piper, to name a few. \u201cI became obsessed with reading their interviews and notebooks and things that kind of talked about their process, because I wasn\u2019t seeing that kind of thought in the theater,\u201d Jacobs-Jenkins said. \u201cI was connecting so intensely to it as a human.\u201d He also named the anthropologist Clifford Geertz and the playwright August Wilson as impactful, specifically Wilson\u2019s goal of approaching his work with an \u201canthropological eye\u201d. \u201cComing across those two ideas made me go, \u2018Wait, what if I have a different strategy when it comes to how I think about my creative work,\u2019\u201d Jacobs-Jenkins said. Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019s methodology has clearly proven successful. But despite major recognitions, he said being on Broadway didn\u2019t feel like a given. \u201cThe culture I was coming up in [was one] where that just wasn\u2019t happening if you were a Black artist,\u201d he said. To be at that stage, especially with such a subversive work, is a complicated experience for Jacobs-Jenkins. On one hand, he fully recognizes Broadway as an \u201cimportant cultural marker\u201d. \u201cMy mom and aunt knows what Broadway is. When I was out here making performance art, my elementary school principal came to a performance and was like, \u2018Oh, when will we see you on Broadway?\u2019\u201d he said. But he is acutely aware of the theater industry\u2019s frustrating treatment of Black artists, particularly its reductive tokenization. \u201cI think my career was based on making people uncomfortable who want to do that,\u201d Jacobs-Jenkins said of flattening labels. \u201c[But] if they can\u2019t figure out how to like, talk about artists as artists, rather than tokens, then like, what are we out here doing?\u201d he added. The theater industry is still rife with false expectations around work by Black artists, he said. Beliefs that shows by Black artists will close early, the slotting of those plays in the fall, eons before award voting takes place. \u201cOnce you see how the sausage gets made, it\u2019s hard to be obsessed with sausage,\u201d he said. But amid those concerns, Jacobs-Jenkins recognizes the \u201cradical\u201d nature of Broadway, specifically when it comes to audiences arriving to his plays. \u201cPeople are showing up with no context for the play. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about. They don\u2019t know what or who I am. And, watching them go on this ride has been very special,\u201d he said. Jacobs-Jenkins also added that Broadway had the ability to attract a phenomenal ensemble of actors, as seen in Appropriate. Gushing about the cast, he highlighted the work of Paulson, who stars as the eldest Lafayette sibling. \u201cShe\u2019s unafraid to play something ugly,\u201d he said of Paulson\u2019s raw depiction. \u201cThat bravery to me is what actually defines an artist. And, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so cool to work with her,\u201d he added. With Appropriate\u2019s opening night near, Jacobs-Jenkins lives in the experience as a \u201cblessing\u201d, especially backed by such a thrilling ensemble. \u201cThis is such a gift, [especially] getting to see audiences on this level,\u201d he said.",

        "body": "There weren\u2019t many men visiting Women Dressing Women, the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s new exhibit on female designers through modern history. It was as if all the ladies who attended had checked their boyfriends or husbands at the door, where they huddled together like dads outside a Forever 21 dressing room during back-to-school shopping season. We were better off for it. It felt like a screening of the Barbie movie inside the Met\u2019s Costume Institute on an early afternoon last week. I saw people of various races, ages and body types let out collective shrieks at an original Chanel little black dress. As I stood in front of a sexy, see-through, white Tory Burch gown, I nodded emphatically when a woman turned to me and said, \u201cI need that for my wedding.\u201d Nearby, one twentysomething complimented another on her Telfar loafers. When two elderly women admired a Norma Kamali parachute dress, a young mother offered to take their photo in front of it. At times, the pop feminist vibe among guests felt a little too saccharine, and the posturing of the exhibit itself too self-congratulatory. As the New York Times reported, this is the first exhibit the Met has shown that\u2019s dedicated solely to the work of women. It\u2019s comically overdue. But I couldn\u2019t help but smile as I watched a transient community form among the garments. People who cherish clothes have an instant connection with each other: we live for the spark of adrenaline that comes with complimenting a stranger on their outfit in a restaurant bathroom or crowded party. These moments are why I continue my mercurial love affair with an art form that can make me feel like absolute shit one day and on top of the world the next. For this reason, if you\u2019re willing to turn off the cynical part of your brain \u2013 or the part of your brain that\u2019s suspicious of cults \u2013 Women Dressing Women is a triumph. There are pieces from more than 70 female designers dating back to the early 20th century, and each one is gorgeous. Winding through the exhibit, you\u2019ll find 1920s flapper garb, 1940s workwear, jumpsuits from the 60s and 70s, 80s power shoulders, 90s slinky slip dresses, and pieces from runways as recent as this year. Their omission from fashion lore is one of the driving forces behind Women Dressing Women, which seeks to celebrate designers who were often denied credit for their contributions to culture. Some of the examples are egregious. Ann Lowe, a Black American designer, crafted Jackie Kennedy\u2019s era-defining wedding dress, though her name wasn\u2019t attached to it until years later. According to the Washington Post, Lowe faced many indignities while doing her job: upon delivering the gown to the wedding party in Newport, Rhode Island, she was told to go through a service entrance. She refused; either the dress went through the front door, Lowe said, or it went back to New York. One of Lowe\u2019s other creations, a darling white, empire-waisted gown with rose appliqu\u00e9s, gets a prominent spot in the Women Dressing Women collection. Steps away from Lowe\u2019s piece is the Delphos gown, a finely pleated silk garment released in the first years of the 20th century and designed to be worn without underwear \u2013 a scandalous suggestion for its era. The gown was an immediate hit, its success attributed to and benefiting Mariano Fortuny, although his wife, Henriette Negrin Fortuny, actually designed it. Gen Z might appreciate the story of Elizabeth Hawes, one of the best-known designers of the 1930s, a critic of the industry\u2019s excess and early campaigner for genderless clothing \u2013 she believed that men should wear skirts and women should wear trousers. (Disillusioned with her career, Hawes abandoned design and became a United Auto Workers organizer \u2026 where she also encountered rampant gender discrimination.) You don\u2019t need to be a historian to chart Hawes\u2019 work to that of Hillary Taymour, behind today\u2019s eco-conscious clothing line Collina Strada, known for its inclusive spirit and determinedly fun clothing. A lace, polychrome-printed bodysuit that Taymour made for Aaron Philip, a Black transgender and disabled model, on display in the exhibit, surely would have made Hawes smile. So would the pleated minidress inspired by the Congolese flag that was crafted by Anifa Mvuemba of Hanifa, the Beyonc\u00e9-approved designer of body-hugging knitwear. Women Dressing Women is an exhaustive, and at times quite inspiring, look at the past. It does important work in correcting the historical record (and reminding TikTok-era activists that thwarting gender binaries didn\u2019t start with their generation). I just wish it dreamed more ambitiously for the future. When I say I love fashion, I\u2019m referring to the clothes, not the industry. We know the business behind the art is run by rich, white, conglomerate-owning men who are completely out of touch with the majority of people who buy clothes. Women Dressing Women won\u2019t change the industry. Given that it is produced by the Met (and sponsored by Morgan Stanley, no doubt a fan of the corporate status quo), it has a tendency to define feminism as the acquisition of power and influence for women. But the most creative designers in the exhibit wanted to dismantle the system, not become a part of it. Vivienne Westwood never gave up her punk ethos even as she rose up the industry\u2019s ranks. The British designer was outspokenly anti-capitalist, demonstrating with Extinction Rebellion up to her death last year at age 81. One could argue that Westwood\u2019s contemporary Katharine Hamnett created the modern slogan T-shirt, selling tops with anti-war and anti-Margaret Thatcher statements in the 1980s. Hamnett\u2019s pro-disarmament \u201cStay Alive in 85\u201d tee is included in the collection. While these women may not have garnered the same attention as top male designers of the era (Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein are all household names), they used their fame to advocate for change. That\u2019s more revolutionary than accepting a top job at one of the big conglomerates like LVMH or Kering, both still run by fashion\u2019s favorite demographic, white guys from France. Likewise, any institution that celebrates Karl Lagerfeld the same year it launches its first all-woman exhibit deserves skepticism. Women Dressing Women\u2019s co-curator Mellissa Huber worked on this year\u2019s Met Gala, which was dedicated to the late creative director of Chanel. Despite the fact that he was a misogynist who upheld fashion\u2019s shameful tradition of thin-worship and exploitation of models, the Met produced a mostly uncritical exhibit that doubled as a shrine to the man. Are our institutions finally celebrating women because it\u2019s the right thing to do, or because it\u2019s trendy? (Women Dressing Women\u2019s original launch was set for 2020 to coincide with 100 years of women\u2019s suffrage in America; Covid delayed it. That still would have been too late.) I do hope, though, that Women Dressing Women changes its visitors, whose plucky exuberance you can\u2019t help but absorb as you meander through the garments. You don\u2019t need to work in fashion to appreciate this. If you wear clothes, it\u2019s worth learning the lineage of style. If every piece in the collection has a story (and most do; please read the wall text!), then that story only grows richer when the piece is worn by a woman with her own reasons for getting dressed in the morning. As I left the Costume Institute, I finally saw one man entering the exhibit. He was young, and I guessed he was a design student at one of the New York fashion schools, Parsons or FIT. (His all-black ensemble and bleached eyebrows gave it away.) He looked serious and carried a scratch pad. You could tell he planned to take notes.",

        "body": "The UK and Switzerland will agree to forge closer links on Thursday in a post-Brexit accord that aims to deepen ties between the City and the Swiss banking system. In a move that brings Europe\u2019s largest financial centres closer together, the mutual recognition agreement will be signed on Thursday by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, during a visit to Berne. The Treasury said the tie-up was a boost for post-Brexit Britain and would ease cross-border market access for a wide range of financial services sold by insurers, banks and asset managers. The chancellor will claim the agreement was only possible once the UK had quit the EU and was able to strike its own deals with leading financial centres. \u201cThe Berne Financial Services Agreement is only possible due to new freedoms granted to the UK following its exit from the EU,\u201d the Treasury told the Financial Times. \u201cThe agreement will enhance the UK and Switzerland\u2019s already thriving financial services relationship.\u201d The Treasury is expected to say the deal will allow large companies and wealthy individuals in each country to more easily conduct business. London is renowned for the breadth of its financial activity and has already signed an accord with New York, the world\u2019s largest financial centre. However, a recent study by the City of London Corporation, the local authority covering the Square Mile, found \u201cother financial centres growing faster\u201d than London, which was ranked second to its US rival. It named Singapore, Paris and Frankfurt as making gains at London\u2019s expense. Switzerland has also suffered a dent to its prestige as a financial centre after the collapse of its second largest bank, Credit Suisse, which needed to be rescued earlier this year through a merger with its rival UBS. David Henig, a trade expert and UK director at the European Centre for International Political Economy, said it was difficult to assess the impact of the agreement, which was as much about shoring up existing business as opening channels for a wider relationship. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any details of the agreement and that makes it very difficult to assess its impact,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is possible that it goes beyond the equivalence agreement that the EU has with Switzerland, but again, without knowing the detail, it is hard to judge.\u201d The arrangement is expected to boost Lloyd\u2019s of London and other insurance businesses, which have found it difficult to overcome regulatory hurdles when piecing together complex deals. The UK government has presented signing new trade deals as one of the benefits of Brexit. Earlier this year, Britain struck a deal to join an 11-nation Asia-Pacific free-trade bloc that includes Australia, Singapore, Japan and Canada. Paul Blomfield, a Labour MP and co-convener of the cross-party UK Trade and Business Commission, said the agreement would be well received across the City \u201cand is a welcome acknowledgment from the government that providing regulatory certainty between UK industries and their most important markets is a good thing\u201d. But he urged the government to go further and open talks with Brussels. \u201cThe EU remains the largest overseas market for most British businesses and protecting them demands similar arrangements of beneficial regulatory alignment, which will break down barriers, reduce costs and unlock the huge potential of the UK economy,\u201d he said.",

        "body": "50 Rain Dogs (BBC One/iPlayer) Created by Skint Estate memoirist Cash Carraway, this dark drama about a single mum and her daughter trying to get by in modern broken Britain felt incredibly original and authentic. Daisy May Cooper was superb as straight-talking Costello Jones, a sex worker trying to write a book after being evicted with her daughter Irish (Fleur Tashjian). It wasn\u2019t always an easy watch, but with a sharp script, compelling performances (Jack Farthing was also brilliant as Costello\u2019s troubled posh friend Selby) and pitch-black comedy, it was a bold series from a new voice in TV with a lot to say. What we said: \u201cRain Dogs is not really a comedy at all. It\u2019s a bleak and beautiful drama in which the rare laughs are a matter of survival, like holes punched through the dark.\u201d Read more 49 Beckham (Netflix) Not only did this documentary have the juiciest, starriest cameos of the year \u2013 the astounding talking heads just kept coming \u2013 but we also got a riveting look behind closed doors as David and Victoria ribbed each other mercilessly (her reveal about her \u201cworking-class\u201d dad driving her to school in a car that turned out to be a \u2026 Rolls-Royce was worth the price of admission alone.) As well as showing David\u2019s life today \u2013 all beekeeping, barbecuing and candlewick snipping \u2013 it was an evisceration of the 90s/00s culture that could have broken him (especially after he lashed out in that World Cup and the death threats started), plus proof of the pain he and Victoria have endured as a couple (Rebecca Loos could have broken them, too.) Still, Posh and Becks got through it \u2013 and they end up here doing the electric slide to Dolly Parton. What a wild ride. What we said: \u201cThere are loads of gossipy nuggets: about the sarong, the many haircuts, the decision to wear purple at his wedding. It\u2019s a lot of fun, and each episode flies by. Brand Beckham will be relieved.\u201d Read more 48 The Lying Lives of Adults (Netflix) It was easy to miss Elena Ferrante\u2019s vibrant coming-of-age story when it quietly dropped on Netflix at the start of the year. Set in 1990s Naples, the drama follows middle-class liberal teenager Giovanna, whose life is turned upside-down when she meets her chain-smoking, straight-talking estranged aunt Vittoria from the rundown part of the city. It is a must-see for fans of the author\u2019s stunning preceding adaptation, My Brilliant Friend, with similar themes of relationships, loyalties, sex, politics and class divides. What we said: \u201cAs always, Ferrante has impeccable insight into the complex psychology of teenage girls, and Giovanna\u2019s attempts at self-discovery, as she tries on and discards various identities, are painfully familiar and universal.\u201d Read more 47 Lessons in Chemistry (Apple TV+) This charmingly styled, 50s-set tale of a prodigious female chemist using a TV cooking show to battle the patriarchy took a bestselling novel and turned it into zippy, emotive and wry television. There was killer knitwear, Brie Larson\u2019s enjoyably comic turn as a lead who is low on emotional intelligence, plus a romance that veered between charming and utterly heartbreaking. Even better, it absolutely one-upped the original book \u2013 by only featuring one episode narrated by a dog. What we said: \u201cImagine Mad Men set in academia instead of Madison Avenue and you will have a fair idea of Lessons in Chemistry.\u201d Read more 46 The Change (Channel 4) Bridget Christie put the menopause at the heart of this refreshing comedy, both scrutinising and celebrating an inevitable experience that has so rarely been explored on screen. She played Linda, a 50-year-old who, after learning she is going through the menopause, got on her motorbike and left her family to go and find herself in a forest. There, she had a weird and wonderful time, meeting new people and attending an eel festival \u2013 which made for the most profound finale of the year. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s The Vicar of Dibley in biker leathers, essentially; this story of a lone middle-aged woman shaking things up in a tight-knit rural community, but further enhanced by the folky feminism that runs through Gloucester-born Christie\u2019s comedy like the River Severn.\u201d Read more 45 Boat Story (BBC One/iPlayer) From the Williams brothers (who are also behind hit series The Tourist), this was a stylish, sinister but always fun genre-bending thriller \u2013 an acquired taste for some, but a jaw-dropping treat for others. It followed Janet (Daisy Haggard) and Samuel (Paterson Joseph), who meet on a beach when they find a boat with two dead bodies and big bags of cocaine in it. Within minutes, they decide to swipe the drugs and deal with the consequences. After all, when it feels like you\u2019ve got nothing, you\u2019ve got nothing to lose. What we said: \u201cThe drama evokes Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson (particularly in the script, which describes Janet in voiceover as \u2018a woman with blue hair, driving towards a Thursday\u2019) and the Coen brothers in its ability to mash genres together. It does so with a confidence that avoids gimmickry and makes the show far greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d Read more 44 A Small Light (Disney+) This lovely second world war drama explored a side of the Anne Frank story that had long gone untold. Bel Powley shone as Miep Gies, the caring young woman who, with her husband Jan (Joe Cole), helped the Franks go into hiding during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. It managed to strike a tricky balance of witty, heart-wrenching and somehow hopeful \u2013 even though we know how tragically it ends. What we said: \u201cThe story\u2019s point is not to despair, but to illuminate courage. It ends with a note telling us that Miep, who lived to be 100, gave talks throughout her life, saying: \u2018Even an ordinary secretary or a housewife or a teenager can, in their own way, turn on a small light in a dark room.\u2019\u201d Read more 43 Dear Mama (Disney+) This attempt to document the life of Tupac Shakur in the context of his relationship with his ex-Black Panther mother, Afeni, was insightful and incredibly detailed. The archive footage of the rapper as a teen was particularly moving, and the juxtaposition of his family members\u2019 reminiscences alongside those of megastars like Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg gave the wild tale a truly intimate feel. It was all the more remarkable given its maker \u2013 Allen Hughes, an ex-collaborator of Tupac\u2019s, who ended up getting Tupac sent to jail. What we said: \u201cFar more thorough and far more sweeping than many other music documentaries, and especially those about stars as culturally significant as Tupac.\u201d Read more 42 The Piano (Channel 4) Never before had so much joy been had on a train station concourse. This Claudia Winkleman-hosted showcase of unsung musical talent performing on railway pianos was relentlessly affecting. From charming pensioners bashing out jazz to kids playing rave classics, almost every performance sizzled with personality. And when blind, neurodiverse pianist Lucy took to the keys for a soaring, inspirational performance? Not a viewer in the world could have dry eyes after that. Astonishingly powerful TV. What we said: \u201cAs well as serving as a tribute to the talents of the players, The Piano shows off the wonder of the instrument, sitting there full of all possibilities, with every semitone on view.\u201d Read more 41 Champion (BBC One/iPlayer) It\u2019s no wonder the music scenes in Queenie author Candice Carty-Williams\u2019s grime/garage drama thrummed with authenticity. They were written by legends including Shola Ama, Ghetts and R&amp;B star Ray BLK, meaning that every time a character took to the microphone, you knew you were going to hum the results for days. This slick hip-hop family drama also featured the very welcome return of Malcolm Kamulete, who\u2019d been missing from our screens since he played one of Top Boy\u2019s brilliant leads while still at school. What we said: \u201cIf you have seen the hip-hop saga Empire or even caught an episode of Nashville, you should be more than ready for a satisfyingly soapy show that celebrates homegrown music.\u201d Read more 40 The Fall of the House of Usher (Netflix) Released during spooky season, this modern take on Edgar Allan Poe was a gothic treat for horror fans. It opened with wealthy patriarch Roderick Usher at the funeral of his children, where we learn that his entire bloodline is now wiped out due to \u201cfreak accidents\u201d. Cue a gruesome backstory to what the hell happened. With spookmaster Mike Flanagan (The Haunting of Hill House, The Midnight Club) at the helm, it was always going to be scarily good. What we said: \u201cFlanagan finishes his Netflix contract on a high, gleefully capturing Poe\u2019s magic, eerie romance and sense of dread.\u201d Read more 39 Russell Brand: In Plain Sight (Channel 4) Ahead of its broadcast on a Saturday night in September, Twitter (and much of Britain) was ablaze with rumours about the mystery subject of this expos\u00e9 on sexual abuse allegations. In the ensuing documentary, made by Dispatches, women very bravely told of their experiences with Brand in horrifying detail. As part of a years-long investigation conducted with the Sunday Times, it was a damning documentary carried by the power of the testimony and no stone being left unturned. A police investigation has since started, and more women have spoken out. This could well be comedy\u2019s overdue #MeToo moment. What we said: \u201cThe allegations themselves are disturbing enough. Being able to see and hear the words spoken, even by anonymised interviewees filmed in silhouette or, in one case, replaced by an actor, lends every awful detail alleged a piercing immediacy.\u201d Read more 38 Black Ops (BBC One/iPlayer) This joke-dense sitcom from Famalam duo Akemnji Ndifornyen and Gbemisola Ikumelo was definitely 2023\u2019s funniest show to shine a light on institutional racism in the police force. It was packed with astonishing comic timing as it followed two definitely \u201cnot street\u201d community support officers forced to go undercover in a drug gang due to a lack of Black coppers. Was there a more fantastic farce this year? It\u2019s hard to think of one. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of comedy that lives or dies by its delivery, and the two leads are pitch-perfect. Some scenes might sound hackneyed on paper, but the delivery is so fresh it feels like the first time anyone has made the joke.\u201d Read more 37 The Gold (BBC One/iPlayer) One of the largest robberies in UK history got the period-crime treatment in Neil Forsyth\u2019s consistently entertaining drama about the Brink\u2019s-Mat gold bullion heist. It had phenomenal ensemble cast including Hugh Bonneville as a determined DCI, tons of twisty storytelling \u2013 and more 80s shoulder pads than a Dynasty episode. What we said: \u201cThe Gold is an ever-enjoyable ride. There are pleasures aplenty to be found in the production design \u2013 the cars! The collars! The carpet swirls! \u2013 and an almost overstuffed ensemble cast.\u201d Read more 36 Dave (Disney+) Stalkers, near-death experiences, creepily realistic sex dolls \u2013 the third outing of this rap comedy had it all. Dave Burd\u2019s semi-autobiographical tale of gangly MC Lil Dicky\u2019s rise to fame finally hit the big time, as did the calibre of its guest stars, including brilliant cameos from Rick Ross, Drake and Rachel McAdams. And Brad Pitt\u2019s extended portrayal of himself as a charismatic oddball in the finale has got to be one of the finest performances of the year. What we said: \u201cDave\u2019s pursuit of self-examination at any cost makes this one of the most nuanced, not to mention one of the funniest, shows around. At times, it touches perfection.\u201d Read more 35 Dead Ringers (Prime Video) In this sex-swapped reimagining of David Cronenberg\u2019s 1988 film, Rachel Weisz had a lot of fun playing identical \u2013 but very different \u2013 gynaecologist twins Elliot (the naughty one) and Beverly (the sensible one) Mantle. As they plan to open a new birthing centre, the show became a dark but witty examination of modern fertility and childbirth. What we said: \u201cIt is intimate and only as horrifying as an ordinarily bad birth might be. Imagine an unexpurgated and more stylishly shot One Born Every Minute. This aspect of Dead Ringers does feel invigoratingly new and, to use that horrible word Beverly loves so much, empowering \u2013 at least to me in the UK.\u201d Read more 34 The Long Shadow (ITV1/ITVX) This sensitive take on the murders of the Yorkshire Ripper was a poignant attempt to tell the tale in a far broader sense than a chronicle of an evil man\u2019s deeds. There were extended insights into the lives of the women who died, and an urgent sense of the deprivation that so gripped 1970s Yorkshire that sex work felt like the only remaining option for these mothers, wives and friends. Peter Sutcliffe himself was a bit part in a drama stuffed with stellar talent, from Toby Jones as a well-meaning workaholic detective to Katherine Kelly as a desperate and astonishingly strong matriarch risking her life for family. A welcome reframing of the narrative around these much-documented deaths. What we said: \u201cMore than any rendering of a notorious case that I can remember, the attention is on the women. Specifically, the living women. And, when they are gone, the people they leave behind.\u201d Read more 33 Starstruck (BBC Three/iPlayer) Rose Matafeo sealed the perfect modern romcom with a third and final series that continued to have a lot of fun with the \u201cwill they won\u2019t they\u201d trope. But there were also plenty of awkward, frustrating and tear-jerking moments, too \u2013 which, with the characters now in their mid-30s, felt like a more mature, nuanced examination of love. \u201cEven though we love each other so much,\u201d Jessie told Tom, as they discussed what\u2019s next for them in the last scene, \u201cI think we\u2019d be pretty stupid to think it can\u2019t happen with someone else.\u201d The perfect new beginning to end with. What we said: \u201cStarstruck has become a better \u2013 more interesting, more relatable, more affecting \u2013 show, one that no longer revolves around its original premise, but instead deals in distinctly un-gimmicky reflections on life\u2019s trajectory.\u201d Read more 32 The Gallows Pole (BBC Two/iPlayer) For Shane Meadows\u2019s first period drama, he told the prequel story to Benjamin Myers\u2019 novel about the 18th-century coin clippers of Calderdale. In typical Meadows style, he let the excellent cast (which included regular collaborators Michael Socha and Thomas Turgoose) improvise northern banter as they put together the foundations of a criminal organisation that would line the pockets of their money-strapped community. Funny, bold and original. What we said: \u201cThe roughcast look, feel and performances combine to make this a drama of rare quality in every sense. It is funny, moving, enraging, shocking by turns and always compelling. Not to be missed.\u201d Read more 31 Silo (Apple TV+) In a year of gritty sci-fi epics that promised lots and delivered little (hello Bodies), this bestselling novel adaptation was a rare treat. Moody, tense, gripping, this 10-part tale of a post-apocalyptic underground community was so watchable it even managed to kill off its lead character in the first couple of episodes and keep you hooked. Of course, it helped that Hollywood star Rebecca Ferguson was waiting in the wings \u2026 What we said: \u201cSilo can be read as a lot of things. It works as a critique of the class system and as a study in who gets to write, and rewrite, history. It\u2019s also about the advantages and disadvantages of truth and of living in denial. But before all of that, it is a fantastically made story. Dig in.\u201d Read more 30 Black Mirror (Netflix) Paapa Essiedu as a disco-singing demon. Salma Hayek Pinault as a hilariously awful version of herself. Josh Hartnett as a creepy, wife-stealing astronaut. All the big names came out for the sixth run of Charlie Brooker\u2019s dystopian anthology series \u2013 causing many an existential crisis with its dark themes of humanity and technology. We also had a model-turned-werewolf and kinky Scottish \u201ctrue\u201d crime. But it was Beyond the Sea \u2013 in which Hartnett starred opposite Aaron Paul \u2013 that lingered in the mind the most, as we saw two astronauts deal with family, grief and the tech that could create holograms of them back on Earth \u2026 What we said: \u201cIt is, overall, a fine collection of new episodes.\u201d Read more 29 Hijack (Apple TV+) Idris Elba\u2019s thriller about a hijacked flight was incredibly silly. It was hard to believe these muppets had it in them to take a trolley drinks order, never mind take control of a plane. And Ben Miles as an adulterous captain was, for reasons unknown, very laughable indeed. But there\u2019s no denying that it was mega binge-worthy, with irresistible cliffhangers that compelled us to hit the \u201cplay next\u201d button right through to the end. Such good fun. What we said: \u201cI binged all seven episodes in one sitting, and I bet you will too \u2013 impeccable. Perfect nonsense, to be enjoyed wholeheartedly \u2013 though probably, for anxious passengers, on terra firma.\u201d Read more 28 Deadloch (Prime Video) This idiosyncratic Australian murder mystery cocks a snook at the well-worn tradition of small towns being packed with murder, and serves up a true-crime satire that\u2019s packed with inventive laughs. It\u2019s dark, dramatic, propulsive \u2013 and very addictive. What we said: \u201cIt might sound a little cliche to say you\u2019ll be guessing all the way to the end, but you really will, with unpredictable pace-propelling twists rolled out from go to whoa.\u201d Read more 27 Only Murders in the Building (Disney+) Meryl Streep! Paul Rudd! The most charming trio of leads on TV! As Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin returned for the gloriously daft third series of this comic crime caper, the ante was very much upped for the calibre of guest star. Streep stole every scene she was in, Rudd\u2019s supremely game turn as an excruciatingly awful Hollywood star was a riotous pleasure and Tina Fey\u2019s evil true-crime podcast host was as brilliant as ever. A consistent delight. What we said: \u201cIn the third season, the show is more committed to fun, taking every opportunity to slip in a witty retort or a Bob Fosse-style musical number. The central trio are at their finest and one can only hope there are many more years of good old-fashioned, murderous fun ahead to keep these three occupied.\u201d Read more 26 Squid Game: The Challenge (Netflix) Hailed as the most epic reality show in history, with 456 players and the biggest prize ever offered up (that gleaming piggy bank hung on high, bulging with millions of dollars), cynics may have said that Squid Game: The Challenge could never live up to the Netflix K-drama that broke viewing records two years ago, or that it would empty it of its anti-capitalist sentiment. But within moments of watching, they\u2019d be transfixed. The contestants started by playing the games from the show, before being forced into far more juicy and bitchy territory (minus the deaths of course.) Battleships! The glass bridge! The constant backstabbing! The nimbleness with which it switched between characters, made us care about the fates of 400 people and remained utterly compelling was a true feat of editing. A remarkable piece of television. What we said: \u201cThe most gripping reality TV since The Traitors.\u201d Read more 25 The Curse (Paramount+) Spectacularly and singularly cringeworthy from start to finish, The Curse starred Emma Stone and Nathan Fielder (also known for The Rehearsal, a stone-cold classic of odd, awkward TV) as a couple trying to make over a town in New Mexico as an eco-dreamscape \u2013 though mainly for the purposes of their reality TV show Flipanthropy. What begins as a painful look at the white saviour complex broadens into a send-up of architecture that makes claims to save the planet, the exploitative world of reality TV, the pretentious art scene, gentrification and many other things that should make white people squirm. You may have found it too uncomfortable to stick with, but those who did were rewarded with a bananas and audacious final episode that took the show stratospheric, literally. What we said: \u201cTo say that I enjoyed it, as an entertainment experience, would be a lie. It is horrible and excruciating. Yet it is also inventive, provocative, oddly mesmerising and quite unlike anything else you will see on television this year. It is almost guaranteed to be loved and loathed in equal measure. I must be a TV masochist, because I love it.\u201d Read more 24 Boiling Point (BBC One/iPlayer) The incredibly tense 2021 movie based in a restaurant bubbled over into this nailbiting, state-of-the-nation four-parter. Putting Stephen Graham\u2019s Andy on the back burner, it focused on chef Carly\u2019s (Vinette Robinson) new restaurant inspired by northern cuisine, Point North. We watched the camaraderie and creativity in the kitchen, plus the hell of trying to keep a business afloat (not to mention survive in a cost-of-living crisis, as kitchen porter Jake heartbreakingly stowed away scraps of haute cuisine to eat at home). Tempers frayed near-constantly, and the high-stress environment simmered over into one of the most tragic TV moments of the year. Casual viewing this was not. What we said: \u201cIt is remarkable how quickly Boiling Point drags you into its world and demands that you care about the people there. I wouldn\u2019t watch it after a strong coffee, though.\u201d Read more 23 Time (BBC One/iPlayer) When Jimmy McGovern wrote his deeply affecting and stressful prison drama starring Stephen Graham and Sean Bean as a guard and an unlikely inmate, it was hard to imagine it could be repeated. But he and co-writer Helen Black found new ways to bring us impressive, propulsive drama \u2013 and show how the penal system fails so many \u2013 by transporting us to a women\u2019s prison this year. From Bella Ramsey\u2019s teenage addict Kelsey to Jodie Whittaker\u2019s Orla, who went to prison for fiddling her leccy meter, then ended up on the streets living in a tent the prison provided for her, it was a vision of how deep the rot has set in that left you both weeping and cursing. What we said: \u201cLike the first series, it brings attention to a terrible problem and demands a search for answers.\u201d Read more 22 Ghosts (BBC One/iPlayer) From headless Humphrey to Robin the caveman, mardy Lady Button to Kitty the divine, Pat the chipper scout leader with an arrow eternally through the neck and Julian the lascivious MP caught with his trousers down in perpetuity, Ghosts gave us a roster of classic characters that we have by now long adored. As the hilarious sitcom bowed out with its fifth and last season, it did so in a gloriously poignant way, with the \u201clivings\u201d Mike and Alison needing more cash ahead of their impending baby\u2019s arrival \u2026 and threatening to leave the ghost gang. Cue multiple desperate attempts by the spooks to make Alison love and never leave them. Roll on the Christmas special! What we said: \u201cGhosts is the ultimate in comfort television.\u201d Read more 21 Planet Earth III (BBC One/iPlayer) Frolicking seals! Baby killer whales with their mums! A female frog kicking randy males off a tree! The third incarnation of David Attenborough\u2019s flagship series was as full of stunning footage as ever, while also plunging into the dire consequences of the climate crisis for the natural world \u2013 from perishing baby flamingos to the death rattles of dying turtles. This wasn\u2019t just a visual spectacle, it was an important environmental warning call. What we said: \u201cThe footage, gathered over five years across 43 countries, is astonishing and awe-inspiring. The first episode alone, dedicated to coasts, travels from Kent to Australia, through South Africa, Canada, Indonesia and more. The scale and scope are spectacular.\u201d Read more 20 Reservation Dogs (Disney+) The most criminally underrated comedy on TV came to a brilliant end with its third series. The first-ever show created entirely with Native American talent has long been a masterclass in how to pinwheel between hilarious comedy and poignant meditations on grief, and its final season was no exception. Before it came along, there had never been a show with such a distinct and impeccably written and performed look at life on a US reservation. Hopefully, this piece of landmark TV is just the start of the floodgates opening. What we said: \u201cReservation Dogs can be the goofiest comedy, especially when it plays with psychedelic genre influences in episodes about stoners happening upon demonic cults and space aliens. But that humour shares space with a remarkably mature and soulful approach to mourning, and an honest representation of how its characters must learn to carry loss and absence.\u201d Read more 19 The Marvelous Mrs Maisel (Prime Video) \u201cI want a big life,\u201d said Midge (Rachel Brosnahan) in her career-breaking standup routine on The Gordon Ford Show. And finally \u2013 after five hilarious seasons \u2013 that big life was about to start for our favourite 50s housewife turned comic. There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house when she shared a look of pride with her long-suffering agent, Susie (Alex Borstein). And the flash-forward scenes showing just how marvellous Midge\u2019s world became were the cherry on the cake. What we said: \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to feel proud of Midge and Susie, and yet I do. I want to grab a bar stool and cheers a martini with them. This isn\u2019t the best season, but it is absolutely the right one. It is ending at exactly the appropriate moment, and these last episodes are the finest ode to what\u2019s been a fabulously funny and exquisitely produced series.\u201d Read more 18 Dreaming Whilst Black (BBC Three/iPlayer) Fresh, funny and unlike any other comedy on TV \u2013 this full series was created after it won a Bafta based on its pilot alone, and it was the year\u2019s most unique sitcom debut. The tale of an aspiring film-maker Kwabena\u2019s (Adjani Salmon, who also created the show) who struggles to be taken seriously by the rich, white denizens of the movie industry was packed with razor-sharp observational humour about casual racism, health inequality and the difficulties of succeeding while staying true to your community. There were white office workers making weird confessions about penis size, excruciating Busta Rhymes karaoke sessions involving the N-word and a bartender who assumes that all customers of colour must know each other (\u201cAre you paying together?\u201d \u201cNo, we\u2019re just \u2026 Black\u201d). A triumph. What we said: \u201cWhat Dreaming Whilst Black has done is write its own formula. I hope there\u2019s another series, and soon.\u201d Read more 17 Somebody Somewhere (Sky Comedy/Now) Touching, poignant, full of diarrhoea-related laughs: the second series of this smalltown US comedy went where few shows dare. The adorable, up-and-down BFF-ship between lead characters Joel and Sam continued to be one of TV\u2019s sweetest friendships \u2013 not least during a riotous final-episode performance of 80s power ballad Gloria. What we said: \u201cThere aren\u2019t many series that bring on tears as often as this one, particularly not when they are also highly proficient comedies, but Somebody Somewhere has a knack for spiky sentimentality that goes for the jugular. Even in its quietest moments, it is dazzling stuff.\u201d Read more 16 I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson (Netflix) There is nothing else on TV like this absurd 15-minute sketch show. Its skits are delightfully disorienting \u2013 careening off in wild directions until laughter mingles with shock. In its third season, it served up just as many moments of hysteria, guest stars including Jason Schwartzman, Fred Armisen and The Bear\u2019s Ayo Edebiri, and something totally new: the odd moment where things actually work out OK for Robinson\u2019s OTT characters. One of TV\u2019s funniest shows, bar none. What we said: \u201cIts opening pair of sketches alone offer four separate heaving, helpless belly laughs; the sort of laugh that forces you to pause and rewind the episode because your laughter blew through a handful of other jokes. I\u2019ve sat through entire seasons of television that haven\u2019t made me laugh as much as I Think You Should Leave manages in three minutes. It is an incredible, extraordinary achievement.\u201d Read more 15 Jury Duty (Freevee) Would this reality TV experiment have been so endearingly gripping if it hadn\u2019t cast such an unbelievable sweetie as its main contestant? Luckily, we had no need to find out. Every participant in this supposed documentary about jury service in the US was an actor, apart from central participant Ronald Gladden, who was unwittingly put into super-elaborate situations designed to test his moral compass. From taking the blame for James Marsden\u2019s toilet-blocking poo to proudly stepping up as the foreperson, Gladden proved himself to be a TV hero time and again \u2013 selflessly doing the right thing, no matter how excruciating the setup. At times, it was heart-meltingly lovely television \u2013 as long as you could stand the awkwardness. What we said: \u201cI am on my third re-watch of Jury Duty now, and each time I notice new, beautiful little details that make me gasp at the sheer logistical thrill of them pulling this off.\u201d Read more 14 Colin from Accounts (BBC Two/iPlayer) Imelda Staunton, David Tennant and Jason Isaacs were among the celebrities who lavished praise on the real-life husband-and-wife duo who wrote and starred in this joyful Australian sitcom. From the cute, injured dog on wheels and absurdly novel way of introducing the romantic leads (nipple-based car accident, anyone?) to its infectious dry humour, this series was hugely charming. No wonder it ended up becoming the sleeper hit of the summer. What we said: \u201cIt is ordinary life with all the good lines jammed closer together.\u201d Read more 13 Barry (Sky Atlantic/Now) \u201cOh wow,\u201d were Bill Hader\u2019s last words as hitman turned amateur actor Barry Berkman in this bleakly brilliant final season. Oh wow indeed! The show had become so dark it was almost unbearable at times \u2013 but the treacle-black comedy always flowed. With Sarah Goldberg as Barry\u2019s morally questionable girlfriend Sally Reed, Henry Winkler as delusional, washed-up actor Gene Cousineau, and Anthony Carrigan as hard-to-hate bad guy NoHo Hank, it was a cast of total weirdos. But part bloody shootout, part Hollywood satire, the last half hour of this story was a perfectly awful finish. What we said: \u201cBarry deserves to go down as one of the best of all time.\u201d Read more 12 I\u2019m a Virgo (Prime Video) Anti-capitalist rabble rouser, satirical take on pop culture, a diatribe against caped crusaders: Boots Riley\u2019s tale about a 13ft teenager wasn\u2019t your average superhero series. Instead it was an inventive, lo-fi take on a genre it seemed to want to destroy from within. Given what an original and hyper-intelligent piece of storytelling it was, if it gets another season, it might just manage it. What we said: \u201cI\u2019m a Virgo is as fresh and invigorating as a cold shower. It wakes you up.\u201d Read more 11 Fleishman Is in Trouble (Disney+) The big question with this TV adaptation of the hit novel was whether it would hold viewers\u2019 attention until it repeated the book\u2019s big trick \u2013 really hitting its stride in the final stretch. The answer was yes: the opening episodes were unquestionably hooky, as we plunged into the tale of recently separated New York doctor Toby Fleishman (Jesse Eisenberg), who wakes one day to find his wife Rachel (Claire Danes) has disappeared. Is she at a yoga retreat, or has she abandoned their family for keeps? But when the show hit its real crux, it was a giddy, disorienting delight: a harrowing look at the tedium of middle age and lives unfulfilled, thanks to a stunning performance by Lizzy Caplan. A rare treat that will very much hit home with those of a certain age. What we said: \u201cI demolished it in as close to one sitting as life these days allows, because it is as addictive as it is perceptive.\u201d Read more 10 Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland (BBC Two/iPlayer) In a year of hotly anticipated landmark TV franchises returning to our screens, no one expected one of the finest pieces of television to be a little-heralded documentary about the Troubles. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland managed: a personal, soul-baring take on life in the country from 1969 to 1998 that is one of the most staggering achievements of the year. As paramilitaries on both sides shared their truths, it was a journey into trauma, regret, redemption, the terrifying ease with which civil war can spring up, and how there is always hope for peace \u2013 even when it seems impossible. What we said: \u201cThis was the most important TV series of the year: a road map of how conflict begins and, crucially, how it can end. Parts of it will lodge in your brain like shrapnel.\u201d Read more 9 The Sixth Commandment (BBC One/iPlayer) This devastating four-part drama told the real story of Peter Farquhar and Ann Moore-Martin, and the man who conned them both into fake relationships with him before he murdered Peter and attempted to murder Ann. It could so easily have been another gauche dramatisation of a true crime. But with Sarah Phelps at the helm, it was beautifully and thoughtfully crafted, with the victims and their families always at the heart of it. The performances were outstanding, with Timothy Spall putting in what many viewers lauded as a career best. What we said: \u201cOnce in a while a drama gets under the skin so deeply it stays with you. No, in you. Frame after searing frame. The Sixth Commandment, written by Sarah Phelps and directed by Saul Dibb, was the most gut-wrenching example of the year. Perhaps the decade. In four harrowing, nigh-on unbearable episodes it took a genre often prurient, insensitive and morally dubious, and gracefully upended it. The Sixth Commandment was true crime that focused on the victims, though even to use that word feels like a thoughtless reduction. What it gave was a dignity rarely afforded to people whose lives are destroyed by crime.\u201d Read more 8 Top Boy (Netflix) After five TV-changing, fiercely innovative series, this Drake-backed drama bowed out with its greatest-ever season. There were shootouts, broken hearts, moments of achingly poignant tragedy and a timely reminder of the human costs of Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201cbatshit\u201d Rwanda policy. The bar has been set for inner-city British gangster dramas \u2013 not least by a final scene whose brilliance was nothing short of heart-in-mouth astonishing. What we said: \u201cRather than waiting until its quality slipped, it ended on unquestionably its finest series yet, with a climactic scene that is shocking, bewildering and so compelling that it demanded rewatching again and again. In a year that\u2019s seen fantastic finales from landmark dramas including Succession, Happy Valley and Barry, Top Boy\u2019s arguably trumps them all.\u201d Read more 7 Blue Lights (BBC One/iPlayer) On paper, this Belfast police drama provided a fresh twist on the genre by following three new recruits to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, with a couple of months of probation still to go. In practice, it breathed new life into a much-done type of TV by taking a bird\u2019s-eye view of a city still coming to terms with the legacy of the Troubles \u2013 and the problematic nature of policing it. Impeccably written characters, charmingly blossoming relationships between colleagues, and one of the most tragic TV deaths of the year made this gripping procedural feel like a Belfast version of The Wire. What we said: \u201cWhen did you last watch a whole show with bated breath? Blue Lights was six hours of raw, relentless TV \u2013 a thrilling examination of everyday courage and rebellion that showed how easily the overly hopeful can be crushed.\u201d Read more 6 The Last of Us (Sky Atlantic/Now) Too poignant to please zombie-loving viewers, too full of murderous fungus monsters for your average prestige drama, The Last of Us was a totally idiosyncratic creation. That it managed to find a huge worldwide audience is testament to what an incredible piece of TV it was (not to mention the best video game adaptation ever). The tale of ex-construction worker Joel escorting medical miracle Ellie across a pandemic-ravaged US was so heart-in-the-mouth tense that at times it was almost too much to watch. And yet watch people did. You know it\u2019s an excellent apocalypse show when the most impressive achievements are the relationships at its heart: from the understated beauty of Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie\u2019s (Bella Ramsey) burgeoning father/daughter-esque relationship to Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett\u2019s poignant episode about love in the end times. Gorgeous, soul-stirring television. What we said: If The Last of Us was just nine episodes of Joel and Ellie trudging through crumbling cityscapes (and yes, that did make up a lot of the show), it would have made for pretty great TV. But the show had bigger ideas. Its third and best episode abandoned the larger plot altogether for a standalone story about the blossoming romance between a gruff survivalist and a man who fell into one of his traps (what a meet-cute!) If you were a particularly cynical exec, this was the episode you\u2019d chop. But its existence was part of what made The Last of Us a richer, deeper show than anyone could ever have expected. Read more 5 Poker Face (Sky Max/Now) It\u2019s hard to think of many more exciting prospects than Knives Out\u2019s Rian Johnson doing a murder-mystery series that\u2019s a homage to case-of-the-week detective shows like Columbo \u2013 and which stars the wondrous Natasha Lyonne. Judging by this daftly enjoyable show, there\u2019s a very good reason for that. From its masterly feature-length opener to ludicrously watchable episodes about murderous retirement-home pensioners, it was a riot packed with stellar guest star performances from the likes of Adrien Brody, Rhea Perlman and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. Bring on season two. What we said: \u201cIf Lyonne doesn\u2019t win the outstanding lead actress Emmy in January, I\u2019ll file the lawsuit myself.\u201d Read more 4 Beef (Netflix) There were car chases, shootouts, deaths and kidnaps in this tale of two Los Angeles residents whose lives become consumed by a spiralling feud triggered by a road rage incident. But for all its high-octane, anger-fuelled action, there was humour, tenderness and \u2013 in Ali Wong and Steven Yeun\u2019s outstanding performances \u2013 a tale of the ways deep, existential sadness can be overcome by the most unlikely of allies. What we said: \u201cTaken as a whole, the 10 episodes of Beef felt satisfyingly complete, but the hunger of the modern television industry \u2013 not to mention the eagerness of Netflix to capitalise on a hit \u2013 means that we should never say never \u2026 But Beef is such a miraculous show, so inventive and daring and propulsive, that the worst thing in the world would be for it to take another grab at the apple and miss. Perfection like this doesn\u2019t happen very often. Let\u2019s keep it perfect.\u201d Read more 3 Happy Valley (BBC One/iPlayer) Fans waited seven years for Sally Wainwright to give us the third and final instalment of one of the best British TV shows of all time, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. Sarah Lancashire returned on flawless form as weathered police officer Catherine Cawood, about to retire but still living under the threat of an incarcerated Tommy Lee Royce (the excellent James Norton) as she brings up his son/her grandchild Ryan. The strength of the show was, as always, in the finer details. From talk of Todmorden aliens to that confrontation in a Sheffield cafe, we were treated to highlights including a meme-worthy comment about having stew for tea and a final showdown in which Catherine tells Tommy: \u201cThat boy is a prince.\u201d Once again, Wainwright delivered a writing masterclass. What we said: \u201cWho would have thought that \u2018Hiya\u2019 would be a contender for one of the greatest lines in modern TV history? That\u2019s Sally Wainwright for you.\u201d Read more 2 Succession (HBO/Sky Atlantic) Was the final season of Jesse Armstrong\u2019s astonishing dynastic saga its finest from start to finish? Possibly not. But even an eight-out-of-10 performance from this show beats most dramas at their best. Logan Roy\u2019s shock death was one of the year\u2019s most talked-about moments (prompting the Daily Mail to put a bizarre obituary of him on the front page, as if he had been a real person). Really, though, this season was all about the finale. After nine episodes of zinger-packed scheming set up the showdown of the year, it did not disappoint. The terrifying moment Kendall hugged Roman until his stitches popped! The Roy siblings\u2019 cackling about \u201cnobbies\u201d! \u201cI\u2019m the eldest boy!\u201d Ultimately, it bowed out with a revelation that was surprising, depressing and all too realistic \u2013 the exact ending this all-time great needed. What we said: \u201cThe ruthless drama binned Logan Roy after just three episodes of the final season. Of course, showrunner Jesse Armstrong knew exactly what he was doing. He knew that his finest creations were Logan\u2019s grownup kids: Kendall (Jeremy Strong), Roman (Kieran Culkin) and Shiv (Sarah Snook). Taking them out of Logan\u2019s shadow meant Armstrong and his writers could slowly take them apart \u2013 and the siblings\u2019 downfall had almost too many bravura character beats to count.\u201d Read more 1 The Bear (Disney+) It\u2019s done it again! For the second year running, this bravura drama about a high-end chef\u2019s attempt to turn his deceased brother\u2019s grotty Chicago restaurant into a success has topped our list of the finest TV shows around. And no wonder: it didn\u2019t just create a second season with every bit as much heart as its first \u2013 it surpassed it. From the fist-in-the-air joy of seeing Richie\u2019s transformation into a slick maitre d\u2019 via the claustrophobic wonder that was the Berzattos\u2019 fork-throwing Christmas Eve feast, it was such emotional, vital TV that it was impossible to tear yourself away from. There were Boursin omelettes so delicious they became viral sensations, a hitherto-unexpected talent for tender romance, and Jamie Lee Curtis putting in such a temple-throbbingly tense performance as the family matriarch that it\u2019s remarkable she didn\u2019t bust a blood vessel. When it hit that glorious, cathartic finale, it only just felt like this show was really starting to motor. Do we expect season three to top this list for a third time? Yes Jeff! What we said: \u201cIt kept everything that made it great the first time round. The intensity. The wit. The flawless direction. The perfectly naturalistic dialogue that never wastes a moment or misses a beat ... The Bear, in short, remains a banquet.\u201d Read more \u2022 This article was amended on 19 December 2023 because the character of Joel in The Last of Us worked as a contractor in construction before the outbreak, he was not an ex-marine as an earlier version said. His brother, Tommy, had been in the military.",

        "body": "I became aware of Barry in the early 1960s, through the comic strip he wrote for Private Eye, The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie, about the worst aspects of Australians living abroad. I remember its co-founder Richard Ingrams saying Barry was the man who gave the magazine its initial sales boost. Then I was doing a TV programme in the Establishment Club with John Betjeman and he\u2019d just seen Barry\u2019s one-man show and said I had to go and see this man, he was terrific. So not long after he\u2019d moved to London Barry was the talk of two key places. I met him soon afterwards. He was a very charming man with a little edge that you had to watch out for. He would suddenly cut into your chat, and out of nothing, mention your tie or your lack of tie, then go off into this spin, and you\u2019d just think, where\u2019s this going \u2013 you never knew \u2013 but it was hilarious. He had a real gift. He told me he\u2019d started doing this on trips, or on the way back from school football games in Australia \u2013 he was the entertainment in the back of the bus imitating people, like teachers, and making everybody laugh. He got the hang of comedy that way. Barry educated himself from a very early age. He was very keen on music and reading and later he became a massive collector, particularly fascinated by first editions. He was also always drawing and painting and his parents hadn\u2019t been very interested in all that. He was a complicated mixture, in one way out of vaudeville, in another way a private intellectual. When I went to his home in 1989 to interview him for The South Bank Show, it was more like a library and a gallery. I knew I had to be careful. If I stepped in the wrong direction, a waterfall of beautifully bound volumes or a parcel of paintings could be knocked over, or fall on my head. But he was very anchored there, quite sane and straightforward, wanting to show you around to share his love of these things. He was all, do you know this edition? It\u2019s wonderful. Or: do you want to borrow that? We usually had poets, writers, actors or musicians on The South Bank Show, but I wanted to do something different with Barry as he\u2019s such an original person. I\u2019d suggested that I would interview him and then Edna, and on camera he made it a brilliant piece of television. He anticipated things that Edna would say, she would refer back to things \u2013 Barry made it really clever. At that time a comedian was thought of as somebody who just made you laugh, whereas now we know it\u2019s somebody who can make you think. Barry was very much at the forefront of that. There was a genius to characters like Dame Edna and Les Patterson. Barry wasn\u2019t a mimic or an actor. He inhabited these people \u2013 it wasn\u2019t even improvisation, it was immersion. As Les, he was suddenly this hilariously horrible person spitting and farting, and when he got on stage as Edna, he suddenly felt unleashed. I remember getting him to present a South Bank Show award. I announced him, and of course, he wasn\u2019t in the room, then he peeped around one of the doors \u2013 \u201cHello!\u201d \u2013 came on, and destroyed me. He could be cruel, but you had to ride with it, and of course, it was very funny at the same time. He always gauged how far he could go by the reception he was getting. If it was going well, he pushed it further. He did his writing in front of an audience. They were part of the material. I met him over the years at parties and the first nights of plays, and he always liked to chat. It sounds awful but he was a perfectly ordinary, nice bloke. But when he went into being somebody it was like flipping a coin. I don\u2019t think he was in control of it. He just let it rip. I last saw him at an event at the Palladium a few years ago and he hadn\u2019t lost any of his powers. He was in his suit, the normal Barry Humphries \u2013 but you knew you had to watch your step.",

        "body": "A controversial intelligence-gathering program run by Canada\u2019s foreign affairs ministry operates in a \u201cdistinctly grey zone\u201d, puts its officers at risk and breaches global diplomatic conventions, says a damning watchdog report. Canada\u2019s global security reporting program (GSRP), a critical part of the foreign ministry\u2019s security and intelligence footprint overseas, places officers in countries with \u201cpoor human rights records\u201d including Ethiopia, India, Egypt, Turkey, Israel and China. The program has received renewed scrutiny in recent months following reports that Michael Spavor, a Canadian jailed in China for nearly three years, was seeking a multimillion-dollar settlement from Canada\u2019s federal government, alleging he \u201cunwittingly\u201d provided intelligence on North Korea to Michael Kovrig, an officer with the GSRP, who then shared that information with Canada and \u201cFive Eyes\u201d allies. The pair were imprisoned in China from December 2018 to September 2021 and charged with espionage. The newly revealed investigation by the national security and intelligence review agency uncovered troubling aspects of the program, finding that officers lacked \u201cadequate training\u201d and the program did not have sufficient risk assessment and security protocols within to ensure officers \u2013 and their sources \u2013 were protected. In addition, the watchdog warned \u201cit was not clear if all officers understood that once they are no longer afforded diplomatic immunity, a receiving state may seek retaliatory measures against them\u201d. The report was completed three years ago but a public release was delayed because of concerns over the political sensitivities of Kovrig and Spavor\u2019s arrests and detention in China. Canada says the program \u201cgenerates focused diplomatic reporting on security and stability issues in countries of strategic interest to Canada\u201d. These reports are not secret and are read within the foreign affairs ministry and with partner departments. But the review found that the program \u201cdoes not have appropriate safeguards in place\u201d regarding the safety of contacts overseas, adding that the GSRP \u201cdoes not appear to appreciate associated risks\u201d of officers developing a network of sources. It also warned \u201cthe creation of a foreign intelligence entity, within [Global Affairs, the Canadian foreign affairs ministry,] or the allowance of mission creep by the GSRP into covert collection would run against the principles of the Vienna convention\u201d \u2013 the global pact that ensures diplomats can work without threat or fear of influence by the host government. The report also cautioned that GSRP officers relied on the Vienna convention as a \u201cshield\u201d for their actions but did not appreciate the \u201climitations\u201d of diplomatic immunity. The oversight agency said perceptions of GSRP activities by receiving nations \u201chave direct implications on reputational risk to Canada and its allies\u201d, concerns echoed by Stephanie Carvin, a former national security analyst and a professor of international relations at Carleton University. Carvin said that recent controversy over the program only deepens the need for Canada to better understand how intelligence gathering by the GSRP might be viewed by other countries. \u201cBut it also highlights the consequences of Canada\u2019s indecision of whether or not it wants to have a foreign human intelligence agency,\u201d she said. \u201cCanada may not want an MI6, but it also wants information from people living overseas about the countries they are living in. The resulting situation is very grey.\u201d In a statement, Global Affairs says it accepts all of the recommendations in the oversight report and \u201call have either been or are being implemented\u201d.",

        "body": "The shadow energy minister and long-time nuclear advocate Ted O\u2019Brien has accused Labor of weaponising a CSIRO report which found renewables to be the cheapest form of energy. The Australian Energy Market Operator/CSIRO report found renewables was the cheapest form of power. This prompted the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, to say the opposition\u2019s crusade for a nuclear option was not viable. O\u2019Brien has long championed nuclear as a solution to Australia\u2019s emissions reduction energy transition, despite the prohibitive costs and the Coalition government he belonged to showing no serious appetite to embrace nuclear while in power. In response to the latest report, O\u2019Brien said it examined costs through an investment lens, rather than a consumer lens. Investment costs are passed on to consumers in order for investors to recoup and profit from their investment. The report deliberately examines technology costs, which is one of the main drivers of energy investment, to help guide both government and private investors spending in the Australian energy market. \u201cIf an energy plan is to reduce household energy prices it must put consumers at the centre, not investors,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cBut Labor ignores this distinction and instead weaponises GenCost by deliberately misrepresenting the report and assuring Australians its \u2018renewables only\u2019 policy is reducing power prices. \u201cLabor points to GenCost to argue that renewables are the cheapest form of energy, but they fail to finish the sentence \u2013 renewables may be the cheapest form of energy for investors, but not for consumers.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Bowen said the report, which is used to help give guidance to both government and investors about the cheapest forms of energy, vindicated Labor\u2019s energy transition policies. \u201cThe draft report today makes it crystal\u2011clear, the cheapest form of energy is renewable energy,\u201d he said. \u201cRenewable energy is cheaper than coal, cheaper than gas, much, much, much cheaper than nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is the most expensive form of energy available.\u201d The report authors looked to the one feasible nuclear small reactor project in the world, the Carbon Free Power Project in the US, to draw it\u2019s cost and timing conclusions. The company had projected costs of A$18,200/kW in 2020 which jumped to A$31,100/kW in 2022 as a result of global inflation. With cheaper energy options, CFPP had trouble securing energy provision contracts and the project was cancelled in November this year. The project had previously been hailed by O\u2019Brien as evidence of a \u201cburgeoning\u201d global nuclear industry. By comparison, the GenCost report found that under existing policies, the cost of a new offshore windfarm would be between $5,545/kW to $6,856/kW (fixed to floating) while rooftop solar in 2023 cost $1,505/kW. Bowen said the opposition needed to question whether it would continue \u201cwith their ideological fact\u2011free attraction to nuclear energy\u201d. \u201cNuclear energy is a fantasy wrapped up in a pipe dream for Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also is not available by 2030, so if the opposition thinks it\u2019s going to play a role in Australia in meeting 2030 targets, they are engaging in a fantasy.\u201d The report found that if Australia did decide to make a nuclear small modular reactor as part of its energy mix, it would take until at least 2038 to be fully operational in a best-case scenario based on the deployment timing of the cancelled US project. It also found that renewable energy would probably be at least three times cheaper than nuclear energy by that date. O\u2019Brien argued the government should adopt \u201can all of the above approach to technology\u201d and that the Coalition would continue to push for a serious exploration of nuclear. Technology cost for renewables is expected to continue to decrease over the next six years to 2030, although it found that almost all energy technology capital costs increased over the last year due to inflation. Capital costs for onshore windfarms and solar farms both increased by 8%, batteries increased by 2% and gas turbines increased by 14%. Fossil fuels were more complicated, given their reliance on long-term energy provision contracts and growing investor reluctance because of climate policy risks. The report will remain open for consultation for six weeks.",

Under the proposals, festivals and celebrations including Hogmanay, Burns Night, Shrove Tuesday and the Welsh tradition of holding eisteddfodau, where all cultural activities including singing and spoken word are conducted in the Welsh language, could be understood as cultural heritage. The culture minister, Stephen Parkinson, said the government hoped to \u201ccelebrate treasured traditions from every corner of the UK\u201d. The government said it intended to ratify the 2003 Unesco convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage. Artisanal crafts such as thatching, tartan, tweed and basket-weaving, as well as the people who practise these traditions, will also be considered. The register could also include traditions brought to the UK by immigrant communities, such as the Notting Hill carnival and steel pan drumming. These practices are often also referred to as \u201cintangible cultural heritage\u201d or \u201cliving heritage\u201d, inherited from ancestors and passed down through generations. The 2003 Unesco convention seeks to protect such heritage, which is recognised as being a big part of national life. A public consultation on implementing the convention across the UK launched on Friday. Lord Parkinson said: \u201cThe UK is rich in traditions which are passed down from generation to generation. These crafts, customs and celebrations have helped to shape our communities and bring people together, who continue to shape them in turn. \u201cBy ratifying this convention, we will be able to celebrate treasured traditions from every corner of the UK, support the people who practise them, and ensure they are passed down for future generations to enjoy.\u201d The Welsh secretary, David TC Davies, the Scotland Office minister, John Lamont, and the minister for Northern Ireland, Steve Baker, welcomed the move to ratify the convention, which they said would help preserve the UK\u2019s cultural heritage. Davies said: \u201cWe have a huge number of wonderful traditions and customs in Wales that help make our nation unique and distinct, and it\u2019s great that many of these will now be formally recorded and recognised. \u201cIt\u2019s important to preserve and protect living heritage, as well as physical landmarks and heritage sites, to pass on to future generations and maintain our special Welsh culture.\u201d",

        "body": "Gerry Ellen moved to the village of Cambria, California, in 2020, looking for a change of pace. After many years working as a writer in San Diego, she was ready for a quieter life. One day that September, she went out to buy petrol and stopped at Cayucos, a popular dog-walking spot on the coast. \u201cMy little dog and I used to go everywhere together,\u201d she says. While there, she spotted a hand-written sign telling people to remove their rubbish from the beach. \u201cI started reading it out loud and noticed a man behind me was doing the same thing. I turned around and thought: \u2018I really need to meet this person.\u2019\u201d Greg, a retired Harbor Patrol officer who lived nearby in Los Osos, had come to the beach for a quick swim before lunch. \u201cI noticed Gerry Ellen was beautiful, but I was coming to the end of a relationship, so I wasn\u2019t looking for anything,\u201d he says. Because she seemed so friendly, he walked down to the beach with her. \u201cI told him my life story in 15 minutes, while we were barefoot in the sand,\u201d she says. \u201cWe really got on well, but then he decided to turn back because he was hungry and wanted to get lunch. He told me he would put a note with his contact details on my windshield.\u201d When she went back to the car, there was no note and she wondered if it had blown off. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever see him again, but when I told one of my neighbours about our meeting, she said my face was lit up like a Christmas tree.\u201d Although Gerry Ellen returned to the same spot on the beach a few times, she didn\u2019t see him there again. At the time, Greg was preoccupied by the breakdown of his relationship. \u201cIt ended in an amicable way, not long after that day on the beach,\u201d he says. \u201cA few weeks later, I found Gerry Ellen\u2019s email address online. I remembered her surname and the fact that she was a writer, which meant she was easy to find.\u201d Gerry Ellen was working at her desk when she got the email. \u201cI was sitting on my fitball and was so excited I fell off,\u201d she laughs. \u201cHe was very honest and told me about his previous relationship and that he hadn\u2019t wanted to start anything until it was over. At the end of the email he said: \u2018Consider this the note on your car.\u2019\u201d In mid-December, they met for lunch in Cambria. But after two divorces, Gerry Ellen admits she was nervous and wanted to be sure about Greg early on. \u201cMy friend advised me that if I really wanted to get to know him, I should write down questions to ask,\u201d she says. \u201cI asked him things like: \u2018How do you handle anger?\u2019 and \u2018What would your perfect day be?\u2019 Luckily, he gave great answers.\u2019\u201d Greg thought the questionnaire was \u201creally cute\u201d. \u201cOne of the biggest things I realised right away was that she got my humour. I felt as if I could be goofy around her,\u201d he says. Their relationship moved quickly, but Greg wasn\u2019t sure he was ready. \u201cAfter a month, I suggested we have some time out because I had only just come out of a relationship,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was really understanding and, after a couple of weeks, I realised how much I missed her and wanted to be with her.\u201d From that moment on they became a couple and enjoyed spending their time together, having outdoor adventures. \u201cWe often go on hikes or take trips over to Joshua Tree national park,\u201d says Gerry Ellen. They moved in together in Los Osos in 2022 and recently adopted a puppy. Greg says his partner is a great listener and always wants the best for others. \u201cShe\u2019s so carefree. She never looks more than a few steps ahead and, while it can be frustrating at times, I love her free spirit. She\u2019s like a butterfly cruising around.\u201d For Gerry Ellen, Greg is the \u201csalt of the earth\u201d and determined. \u201cHe never wavers from his convictions, which I really admire, and he\u2019s always so kind, generous and funny. He makes me laugh all the time and he\u2019s full of love.\u201d",

        "body": "No one gets into standup comedy expecting a routine factcheck. But that\u2019s what happened when a September profile of Hasan Minhaj in the New Yorker called out the former host of the Netflix series Patriot Act for misrepresenting his truth in two Netflix standup specials. In one, Minhaj described a white FBI informant infiltrating his mosque and an anthrax scare involving his young daughter (neither happened as Minhaj described them, the magazine found). In another, he recalled a white high school crush who jilted him on prom night for seemingly no other reason than his being of Indian descent (she denied it went down like that). The magazine said Minhaj\u2019s stories \u201cblur the lines between entertainment and opinion journalism\u201d, triggering an intense public debate about whether the comedian had stooped to claiming race-based victimhood to advance his career. Bill Maher likened Minhaj, a peer, to Jussie Smollett. In a 21-minute video rebuttal, Minhaj made a case for punching up his biography while poking holes in the New Yorker\u2019s hallowed vetting process. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s happening in the world,\u201d Minhaj intoned, \u201cI\u2019m aware even talking about this now feels so trivial. But being accused of faking racism is not trivial. It is very serious, and it demands an explanation.\u201d His staunch defense did the job of rallying his fans back onto his side, but not in time to undo the damage. Minhaj, a clear frontrunner to replace Trevor Noah as The Daily Show\u2019s permanent host, was reportedly dropped from contention in what looked for all the world like punishment for using creative license in a creative medium. \u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre to me,\u201d says the Last Comic Standing finalist Laurie Kilmartin. \u201cBecause when you look at how modern standup started, it was a thing that happened in between strippers. It\u2019s gutter art. We\u2019re not trying to win a Pulitzer prize.\u201d *** It used to be that comedians were the ones holding the powerful and persuasive to account, at no time more so than when Jon Stewart factchecked the Bush administration and its enablers in the mainstream media from behind The Daily Show desk. But as conventional wisdom of the past has given way to the age of bespoke truths, The Daily Show and other comedy institutions are no longer society\u2019s only funny factcheckers. Ever since standup comedy, a longtime fixture of clubs and late-night TV, achieved mainstream ubiquity, individual comics are doing that job too. And yet standup comedians balk at the prospect of that sobering treatment being turned on their own work. In April 2023, Selective Outrage \u2013 Chris Rock\u2019s hotly anticipated, post-Oscars clapback \u2013 became Netflix\u2019s highest rated comedy special, with more than 36m hours of total engagement. Certainly, more people streamed that special than Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s docudrama on Cleopatra, released the same month. Fact-based film and TV projects have themselves been checked against the official record since time immemorial; Pinkett Smith\u2019s decision to cast a Black actor as Cleopatra raised hackles in Egypt, with academics arguing the queen probably looked more like Elizabeth Taylor. Even music lyrics are taken as articles of fact that can potentially be used in court, as we\u2019re seeing with Young Thug\u2019s racketeering trial in Georgia. There\u2019s little doubt that much of the curiosity for Rock\u2019s special stemmed from a factchecking impulse to square his first-hand experience with third-hand perspectives of the slap seen \u2019round the world. When the world was turned upside down by Covid and the racial reckoning, Dave Chappelle emerged as the man who could make sense of it all. After the 2020 Netflix special 8:46, named for the time it took for Derek Chauvin to kill George Floyd, Chappelle was widely celebrated for putting laughs aside and speaking to the heart of the tragedy. It was only after pivoting to making transphobic jokes in 2021\u2019s The Closer special \u2013 a theme Chappelle returned to again on stage this year after promising to back off (and figures to touch on again in a year-end special) \u2013 that the top comic has been taken more seriously as a spreader of misinformation. \u201cChappelle is by far the lying-est comedian,\u201d said Jesse David Fox, a comedy journalist at Vulture, citing the 2017 special The Age of Spin. In it, Chappelle argues for not throwing away the \u201cvaluable legacy\u201d Bill Cosby left in spite of his history of alleged sexual abuses and, by way of example, notes how Cosby paid for the public address (PA) system for the 1963 March on Washington \u2013 a fact that\u2019s easily disproved. \u201cBecause he\u2019s raised so much gravitas,\u201d says Fox of Chapelle, \u201che just gets away with it.\u201d That gravitas comes from the new \u201cexpectation for comedians [to be] up there with public intellectual people\u201d, says Fox, who also wrote 2023\u2019s How Comedy Conquered Culture \u2013 and the Magic That Makes It Work. \u201cThey\u2019re not just held to the same standard as a famous director. They\u2019re held to the same standard as [the ABC evening news anchor] David Muir.\u201d In 2023, there was little circumventing the demand for truth in comedy. A year after raising hackles for featuring Chappelle at an Ohio show, John Mulaney drew scrutiny again for a bit in his Baby J special about hawking his $12,000 Rolex for half the price to buy drugs \u2013 a story Vulture went to lengths to confirm. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Mulaney copped to omitting the saddest part of that anecdote: that he accidentally dumped $3,000 of the $6,000 he made from selling the Rolex in the trash. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell that story of, you know, \u2018And there I was, selling a watch I had just bought, and I felt so small,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have that tone, you know? I really wanted to present these stories almost as if I was proud of them.\u201d Like Minhaj, Mulaney builds connection with his audience through \u201cemotional truths\u201d, as Minhaj described 70% of his comedic style to the New Yorker (the other 30% he called \u201chyperbole, exaggeration, fiction\u201d). But the veteran standup Kevin McCaffrey cautions: \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in lying for the laugh and lying for the clap.\u201d Where Mulaney aims to please, this year\u2019s most controversial young comic, Matt Rife (you may know him from TikTok \u2013 or his cheekbones), takes factchecks as fighting words. In his 2023 Netflix special Natural Selection, Rife needled women who turn to astrology for help choosing mates. \u201cJust because Jupiter has a ring and you don\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean you should run to the planets for magical relationship advice,\u201d he cracked. The influencer Bunny Hedaya reacted to the clip by posting a video of her six-year-old son offering a humble correction: \u201cActually, it\u2019s Saturn that has the rings.\u201d Instead of taking pushback good-naturedly, the 28-year-old Wild \u2019n Out regular allegedly unloaded on the kid in the comments, slagging off his mother for buying \u201cpresents with the money she makes on OnlyFans\u201d. (Hedaya does not appear to have a presence on that platform, whereas Rife has an account and a debut special named Only Fans.) For too many observers, the exchange seemed about on par for a comic who had apologized for a domestic violence joke in his special by directing the offended to a website for special needs helmets, a gambit that Rife\u2019s bedrock of women fans heard as a breakup line. Lost in the exchange between Rife and Hedaya\u2019s son was the fact that both were right: Saturn and Jupiter each have rings. \u201cThe star comedians are just the most amazing level of sensitive babies now,\u201d McCaffrey said. This wasn\u2019t just a year that saw Rob Schneider rail against wokeism in an \u201cunfiltered\u201d comedy special to a friendly Fox Nation crowd. It was the year Joe Rogan opened an \u201canti-cancel culture\u201d comedy club in Austin, Texas, expressly to remain unchecked. \u201cI\u2019m drunk and high on mushrooms,\u201d he enthused on opening night. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire me from my own club, bitch!\u201d In one clip from his dreaded Christmas Day special for Netflix, Armageddon, Ricky Gervais does the extra work to delineate fact from fiction in a sick punchline that has him calling Make-a-Wish kids \u201cretarded\u201d. \u201cThese are all jokes,\u201d he disclaims. \u201cI don\u2019t even use that word in real life, the r-word.\u201d It goes to show how swiftly standup comedy has evolved from resenting the masses for not taking a joke to resenting them for taking a joke as gospel. *** Minhaj\u2019s work makes it especially tough on audiences to suspend disbelief. Where a more traditional standup might paint a picture in a listener\u2019s mind with little more than a mic in hand, Minhaj drew on compelling visual aids. The FBI informant bit was underscored by Al Jazeera footage of an actual informant. In interviews with a New Yorker staff writer, Clare Malone, Minhaj admitted his story never happened \u2013 to which some say, so what? \u201cThat he experienced racism and Islamophobia matters more than whether it happened exactly as he said it,\u201d said Kilmartin, who judges her peers far more harshly for being actual hypocrites. \u201cWhen Louis CK was positioning himself as the ultimate cool feminist when in real life he wasn\u2019t, that\u2019s when you lose your audience. You can\u2019t be that different from your stage persona. But at the same time, if somebody\u2019s talking about a perceived experience, you have to give them some latitude. If you\u2019re trying to get laughs from a male audience talking about sexism or a white audience talking about racism, you have to change things a bit or they won\u2019t participate. They\u2019ll get defensive.\u201d For the prom bit, Minhaj deployed immersive staging to set the scene, including a screengrab of what looks like the blurred-out faces of his would-be prom date with her now husband \u2013 \u201cIndian as fuck,\u201d he vented, pointing out the irony. Minhaj also closely collaborated with factcheckers on Patriot Act, an extra step that made his material seem that much more airtight. Just as affecting was Minhaj\u2019s use of similarly high production value in his rebuttal video. The whole spiel had the feel of a Daily Show production, with Minhaj at a desk as a series of supposedly exculpatory graphics and audio recordings flashed over his shoulder. (The New Yorker stands by its story.) But in the end he would be forced to admit that much of his standup was embellished for dramatic effect. (He later revealed that actors played the real people shown in the onstage screengrab.) Minhaj told the magazine about his routines: \u201cThe emotional truth is first. The factual truth is secondary.\u201d \u201cIt does seem like that interview with him was done in \u2026 I don\u2019t want to say in bad faith,\u201d McCaffrey said. \u201cBut it does feel like there was an agenda, for sure. I think Hasan is paying a price for being a person that people believed did give a shit about what was real.\u201d That a magazine factcheck would ultimately cost Minhaj a job doing the fake news is an irony that will surely make its way into a future Minhaj Netflix special. He was already drawing on the experience during a recent appearance at New York\u2019s Beacon Theater. After relaying a story about a girl cheating on him in high school, Minhaj warned the audience: \u201cDon\u2019t factcheck me.\u201d \u201cI had to go head-to-head with one of the most dangerous organizations in the world,\u201d he said, ruling out the US military or the Israeli Defense Forces. \u201cI am talking about a white woman with a keyboard.\u201d But in the new era of the standup intellectual, many audiences will see Minhaj\u2019s warning less as a challenge than as a call of duty.",

        "body": "\u2019Tis the season to take a holiday and, in this cozzie-livs crisis, Australians are embracing camping as an alternative to pricier getaways. December data from Hipcamp Australia shows there has been a 47% year-on-year increase in campsite bookings by families with at least one child, a 58% year-on-year rise in bookings with five or more kids and a \u201csurge in multi-family trips\u201d. But for first timers, pitching a tent with kids in tow can be complicated. We asked outdoors experts and seasoned happy campers for their top tips on a (nearly) seamless first camp in the great outdoors. 1. Pick easy equipment As the coordinator of my family of five\u2019s camping adventures, my husband James recommends packing as light and as practical as you can. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to spend money on equipment that\u2019s easy to set up, because there\u2019s nothing worse than trying to set up a complicated tent with three kids running amok after they\u2019ve been in a car for ages,\u201d he says. He also recommends checking reviews on all equipment before purchasing, and buying a premade, camp-specific first aid kit which will have instructions for beginners in the event of an injury. \u201cMake sure that equipment is season-appropriate too \u2013 not all sleeping bags can be used year-round, so consider a three-season sleeping bag that can be used in shoulder seasons.\u201d 2. Pack familiarity, extra clothes \u2013 and wet wipes Iesha Mulla, who describes herself as a \u201ccamping enthusiast\u201d mum, says allowing kids to bring some comfort items, such as their favourite book or a soft toy, \u201chelps them adjust to the new surroundings\u201d. She says packing extra clothes is a must, too. \u201cKids tend to get dirty rather quickly when camping,\u201d she says. \u201cExtra socks, underwear and layers for warmth are crucial. And don\u2019t forget the wet wipes!\u201d I\u2019d add proper vomit bags to the list of essentials, to be kept in the car glovebox. 3. Always bring buckets It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the bigger things but thinking basic is essential. The team at Hipcamp suggest a portable potty \u201cwith an easy waste disposal system\u201d. Even if your campsite has a toilet block, it could well come in handy on the road. In addition to drinking water, bring plenty of buckets and containers of fresh water to wash hands, faces, plates and sandy feet. 4. Make a list, check it twice Robyn, who regularly camps with her husband, three kids and four other families, keeps two lists on the kitchen counter with a pen in the week before they head out. On one, she writes down everything that needs to be done to the house before they leave (including switching off power points and shutting windows) and a list of the last-minute packing stuff they remember as they go (think extra batteries, torches, insect repellent). \u201cWhen the car is completely packed and everyone is inside [ready to leave], get one parent to go back in the house and check both lists to ensure you have not forgotten any important items,\u201d she says. 5. Practise in the back yard If you have the space, try a back yard campout before hitting the road with your kids, Matthew New of Off-Grid Destinations suggests. \u201cThis familiarises them with sleeping in a tent and eases them into the camping experience. Incorporate as much of your camping equipment as possible: use lanterns or flashlights after dark, sit on camping chairs and use only camping gear for bedding to mimic the actual camping experience. [And] try cooking a meal outside, preferably on a portable stove or grill.\u201d 6. Plan gear-free activities \u201cTurn the entire camping experience into a playful adventure,\u201d says Daniel Espada of Gear Adventure. \u201cSet up a scavenger hunt, tell campfire stories and stargaze together. Play interactive games like flashlight tag, nature bingo or storytelling contests.\u201d Relying on nature for activities such as bird watching or plant sketching helps to entertain and uses your surroundings or existing supplies so you don\u2019t have to lug additional materials to keep kids entertained. 7. Group trips make for easy catering \u201cMy biggest tip is to go with multiple families with kids of the same age,\u201d Robyn says. \u201cThe kids form a tribe and the grown-ups can emotionally recuperate around the fire at night together. And split up the dinners between you all so everyone eats together, and you don\u2019t have to worry about prepping a bunch of different meals, because everyone has their own allocated meal time to cook one thing for everyone.\u201d James says splitting equipment between families helps minimise packing too. Meanwhile, the Hipcamp team suggest choosing food that \u201ckeeps and is easy\u201d to make mealtimes simpler \u2013 such as sausages, bread, baked beans and apples. 8. Use the experience to teach life skills Kirianna Poole, who documents her camping-in-a-Kombi adventures with her partner and three kids on Instagram, says enlisting children to help cook gives them purpose and aides in cultivating outdoor life skills and fire safety. \u201cI let the kids stir pots over the fire when I\u2019m nearby, but I always explain the different parts of a fire and where the most heat is found,\u201d she says. \u201cBuilding this knowledge and foundation helps them understand fire and its dangers. In turn, they learn to always respect it.\u201d Plus, getting them to collect and stack firewood is fun, she says: \u201cLike playing a big game of Jenga.\u201d 9. Don\u2019t overlook safety lessons \u201cTeach your children basic safety rules like staying within the campsite, recognising poisonous plants and the importance of staying hydrated,\u201d New says. \u201cEquip them with whistles and small flashlights.\u201d Mulla says it\u2019s important kids \u201cknow the boundaries of your camping area\u201d, using natural markers such as a tall tree or a big rock, which in turn helps you manage their free rein in the outdoors. 10. Lower your expectations \u201cLet go of any standards of hygiene,\u201d Robyn says. \u201cEveryone will go to bed filthy and wake up filthy. Don\u2019t look too closely at anyone\u2019s feet.\u201d 11. Take care of your surroundings \u201cInstil a love and respect for nature by teaching \u2018leave no trace\u2019 principles,\u201d New says. \u201cEncourage them to observe wildlife from a distance and to keep the campsite clean.\u201d 12. Involve the kids in planning \u2013 and have a backup plan \u201cLet [your kids] help choose the [camping] location and plan activities,\u201d New says. \u201cThis builds excitement and gives them a sense of ownership.\u201d He also recommends making a backup plan. \u201cFlexibility is key to a successful family camping trip. While having a plan is great, kids\u2019 moods and interests can change rapidly, so be ready to adapt.\u201d",

        "body": "The Australian cook and restaurateur Bill Granger has died in London aged 54. Fellow cooks, celebrities and lovers of his restaurants paid tribute after the family of the food writer confirmed on Instagram he had died peacefully in hospital on Christmas Day. Granger\u2019s wife, Natalie Elliott, and three daughters, Edie, In\u00e8s and Bunny, were at his bedside, the post said. Granger was born in Melbourne and became a global restaurateur and food writer with a career spanning more than three decades, having taught himself to cook. He was remembered on Wednesday as the person primarily responsible for the global popularity of avocado on toast and developing a distinctive style of Australian breakfast and brunch \u2013 so much so that he became widely known as the \u201cgodfather\u201d of avocado toast. Granger dropped out of art school in 1993 and moved to Sydney where he opened his first restaurant, bills, in Darlinghurst. The corner cafe became known for its fresh flavours and breakfast food, served at a central communal table. In 1999 he and Elliott launched their business globally, which eventually encompassed 19 restaurants in Australia, the UK, Japan and Korea. Granger wrote 14 cookbooks, made five television series and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia last January. \u201cHe will be remembered as the \u2018King of Breakfast\u2019, for making unpretentious food into something special filled with sunshine and for spurring the growth of Australian informal and communal eating around the world,\u201d his family wrote on social media. \u201cHe will be deeply missed by all, with his loss most profoundly felt by his adored family, who are grateful for all the love and support that has been given.\u201d Nigella Lawson said on social media she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to hear the news. \u201cSo cruel.\u201d Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Granger as a \u201cwonderful human [and] kind calm soul\u201d. \u201c[He] had an [extraordinary] ease and style in cooking that could only come from Australia,\u201d Oliver wrote. \u201cMany moons ago I remember going to his first Sydney restaurant in Darlinghurst \u2026 [it was] years ahead of its time.\u201d In London Granger established the chain Granger &amp; Co, with branches in Chelsea, Clerkenwell, Notting Hill, Kings Cross and Marylebone. The Australian writer Kathy Lette said on Twitter/X Granger was \u201cthe most gentle, charming, humble man\u201d and his restaurants were a haven for Australians. The Australian actor Hugh Jackman and his former partner Deborra-Lee Furness said they would miss Granger\u2019s friendship \u201cmost of all\u201d. \u201cHis talent, his joie de vivre, the way he brought people together and his commitment to family were inspiring,\u201d they said in a joint statement. Gwyneth Paltrow said the news was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. The food writer and former MasterChef Australia presenter Matt Preston said Granger was \u201ca genuinely lovely bloke and an inspiration\u201d. \u201cTogether he (with Natalie by his side) helped shape the image of modern Australian food around the world.\u201d Similar plaudits were found across social media, with chefs and cookbook authors, including Darren Robertson, Christine Mansfield, James Martin, Hetty McKinnon and Mark Best among those expressing their sadness, with Granger described as a gentleman who \u201cchanged the entire breakfast game\u201d. Writing on X, the cook and TV host Adam Liaw described Granger as \u201carguably [the] most influential pioneer of modern Australian food\u201d. \u201cHis \u2018sunny\u2019 (his word, not mine) codification of Australian cafe culture at bills is the model on which every Australian cafe around the world is now built. Bloody great guy, too.\u201d The founding editor of Food Illustrated and delicious magazines, Neale Whitaker, said Granger \u201cdefined an era in food for so many of us in Sydney and beyond\u201d. David Prior, former Conde Nast Traveller editor and family friend of the Grangers, said it was \u201cimpossible to overstate the inspiration, impact and importance of what Bill and Nat created\u201d. \u201cIt ushered in a change to our culture, not a fine dining one or canon of strict recipes but a brightly optimistic, quietly sophisticated and totally egalitarian approach to food. Australian food used to be a question, Bill made it a statement. He changed Australia\u2019s food culture first and then via, Granger and Co, came London and its many offshoots and cafes that took direct inspiration. \u201cBill was never anything but gracious and took no pride in authorship of recipes, design or approach but the truth is his was never bettered. The original dna of that bright little corner cafe was telegraphed around the world and yet it always evolved with his curiosity and pitch perfect taste.\u201d Granger was beloved by many in Australia\u2019s fashion industry, with Karin Upton Baker, the managing director of Herm\u00e8s in the country and a former editor of Harper\u2019s Bazaar Australia, remembering him as \u201cfull of light\u201d. \u201cMy babies came with me to Bills for breakfast after many nights of lost sleep,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd there was beautiful Bill smiling and charming and making delicious things to get us through the day. Never forget.\u201d Kirstie Clements, a former editor of Vogue Australia, said Granger was a \u201cwonderful man, with a wonderful legacy\u201d. \u201cRemembering that first shared table in Darlinghurst \u2026 Condolences to his family and to all the Bills staff \u2764\ufe0f\u201d. Environment minister and member for Sydney Tanya Plibersek posted on Instagram: \u201cSo very sad to hear of the death of Bill Granger. His cafes and books have given so much pleasure to so many. A Sydney icon. Condolences to his family and many friends.\u201d City of Sydney councillor Linda Scott also posted a tribute on Instagram, saying: \u201cSydney wouldn\u2019t be Sydney without bills. Thanks for everything, Bill Granger. Your breakfasts reshaped our @cityofsydney Darlinghurst streets, and your cookbooks transformed our kitchens. You\u2019ll be so missed. Vale.\u201d",

        "body": "I\u2019m a father of two, a five-year-old girl and a one-year-old boy. They are both happy and healthy and doing well in life. My daughter started school this year and loves it, she is leading her class in phonics and receiving great feedback from her teacher. But I keep hearing about child prodigies who had already started practising their crafts long before five. From pianists to F1 drivers, it seems some kids are already well on their way, and I don\u2019t know if I should be encouraging, or forcing, my daughter in one certain direction. I do a completely different job to my parents and didn\u2019t settle till later in life. Am I letting my daughter down by not pushing her harder towards a future career? Eleanor says: One of the strange things about parental love is its restlessness; even when things are going well, the worry is they could be going better. It\u2019s natural to be anxious about giving your kid the best start possible, or the most support you can. We want to give our children superlatives and help them achieve them, too. You mention the fact that you didn\u2019t \u201csettle\u201d until later in life. One natural expression of the parental-improvement instinct might be wanting to get your kids on a fulfilling, prosperous path as soon as possible. But there are some things to keep in mind. First, prodigies of the sort you mention are rare. We talk about them precisely because they\u2019re the notable exception. Most people \u2013 most successful people \u2013 were not world-class at anything when they were under 10. Second, early prodigiousness doesn\u2019t necessarily mean long-term success. What it does necessarily mean is an extraordinary amount of work. To be a child or adolescent \u201cwell on the way\u201d to a career defined by excellence, you have to put in astonishing amounts of effort. I mean identity-dominating, sheer brute hours that will alter her life and set expectations for your son. If you are the parent driving that amount of work, you will also be the parent associated with its opportunity cost: with the fact that she is practising or training when others are with friends, trying multiple things, or failing. So pushing (or forcing) her into a career now won\u2019t necessarily guarantee her future. But it will guarantee you change your relationship with her. It\u2019s worth thinking seriously about whether that gamble makes good on its cost. It\u2019s wonderful that your daughter\u2019s skill has been recognised, by you and by her teacher. Perhaps you could try to celebrate that skill \u2013 answering your own wish to not \u201clet her down\u201d \u2013 in a way that isn\u2019t about pushing for a particular career. You don\u2019t mention that she\u2019s showing a preoccupation with any one area, like sport or music. So perhaps the \u201cjob\u201d to shepherd her towards isn\u2019t any specific profession but the task of finding the things she likes and doing more of them. After all, the joy of skill isn\u2019t exhausted by achievement. Athletics or reading or musicianship can just be kaleidoscopically fun ways to learn about yourself and the world. That\u2019s especially true at her age, before skills get intertwined with concepts like \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201ccomparison\u201d. What can you do? How does it make you feel? Would you like to do more of it? The point here wouldn\u2019t be excelling for excellence\u2019s sake but showing her that the very fact she loves doing something is exciting to you. Perhap you could direct some of your wish to not let her down on cementing your relationship, no matter her achievements. Our parents can set us on a path towards a secure, prosperous future; but they can also give us the knowledge that no matter what happens \u2013 no matter our success, or how hard we work \u2013 their love will endure. And constancy of support might be the best \u201csuperlative\u201d you can offer. *** Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

        "body": "Struggling to make small talk as if life isn\u2019t a constant, crippling nightmare? Curious to try six desserts that are better than sex, but not as good as Outkast\u2019s Hey Ya? Want to share in the horror of a woman who proudly brought lunch to work and now has to eat the lunch she brought? All this wisdom and much more can be found at Reductress, the satirical women\u2019s magazine that launched 10 years ago and, a decade later, is as funny and relevant as the day it was born. The outlet, primarily published online, is known for its blend of made-up news stories, personal essays and lifestyle advice, packaged with a bite that mocks the tone of women\u2019s media. Its tongue-in-cheek articles are as comfortable taking on wellness as current affairs, with headlines including \u201cNice! Woman replaces screen time before bed with panicking in the dark\u201d and \u201cInteresting! Box tops for education apparently not valid toward student loans\u201d. The site was founded in 2013 by Sarah Pappalardo and Beth Newell, sketch comedy writers who met through New York\u2019s Magnet Theater. Fed up with male-dominated writers rooms and the \u201ccondescending tone and consumerist slant of women\u2019s media\u201d, they decided to parody a women\u2019s magazine in a blog format, Newell says. \u201cWe knew there was more to be said about women\u2019s experiences in the world, and the kind of outmoded, condescending tone of women\u2019s media in particular at the time,\u201d Pappalardo says. The result took inspiration from both Cosmopolitan and the Onion. Working with a few friends, the pair prepared about 50 posts before launching. The name, Newell explains, was a result of \u201ccombining words that might have a feminine sensibility\u201d; they landed on a combination of reductive and seductress. It\u2019s a tone that still resonates after a decade. Staff are younger, with gen- Zers joining the millennial founders, and topics have ranged from the the climate crisis to #MeToo. But the site continues to publish alarmingly relatable stories on the experience of being alive in 2023, with incisive coverage of our self-improvement obsession and, most recently, the US reaction to the war in Gaza (\u201cAw! This woman was only willing to separate people from their government when it was her and Trump\u201d). A day in the life Early on, Reductress consisted of Newell and Pappalardo meeting in coffee shops; eventually, they moved into an office in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan. They would hold weekly pitch meetings and spend their days writing pieces or editing material sent in by other writers, all while working on their first book \u2013 How to Win at Feminism: A Guide to Having It All \u2013 And Then Some!, published in 2016 \u2013 and other side projects. \u201cInitially Reductress was just an opportunity to give women a shot at writing something funny from our own unique perspectives,\u201d Pappalardo says. The immediate response was \u201csurprisingly positive\u201d: \u201cWhile lots of people had attempted satirical magazine covers, nobody else had made a fully fleshed-out magazine.\u201d Since then, the number of outside pitches has ballooned, and the masthead now includes a staff of five. In 2022, Reductress was purchased by the entertainment company Phenomenal Media (founded by Meena Harris, Kamala Harris\u2019s niece). Along with its online presence, Reductress has published books, holds in-person events, and offers humor-writing classes. But despite its growth, the writing process has remained similar over the course of the decade, Pappalardo says. \u201cWe\u2019ve always started from a strong conceptual foundation with a unique voice and perspective (for example, the headline) before fleshing out any creative idea.\u201d Staff gather to choose the best pitches from contributors, with a few guidelines in mind: \u201cIs it culturally or politically relevant, in the zeitgeist, or something relatable that hasn\u2019t been articulated before?\u201d they say. \u201cWe are always asking, \u2018Is the joke clear? Is it relatable? Does it have some truth to it?\u2019\u201d When it comes to addressing current events, \u201cwe identify who has power in any given context, and consider how that power is being wielded. Someone who has the power in one context may not be powerful in another,\u201d they add. \u201cFor example, a white woman may fall victim to sexism in one context, but experience privilege in another. This is where being specific in your critique and acknowledging context really matters.\u201d In 2016, amid allegations of sexual assault in the comedy world, Reductress published a homepage takeover focused on rape culture, covering the site exclusively with relevant stories. \u201cIt was a challenge to try to get to the heart of our emotions on the topic, which is why we attacked it from various angles,\u201d Newell says. Stories included: \u201cHow to be an ally to both a rapist and his victim\u201d, \u201cMan who sexually assaulted you likes your Facebook post about assault\u201d, and \u201cChill ways to just sort of live with it\u201d. \u201cI think observational comedy pulls at the threads under the surface of human behavior to show people what they know deep down to be true,\u201d Newell adds. \u201cBut when it comes to serious issues, many will remain in denial, so the role of the comedian is often more about giving strength to those who are already somewhat aware, helping them feel seen in their struggles and a little less alone.\u201d \u2018A vast community\u2019 Over the past decade, women\u2019s media has changed \u2013 \u201cmostly for the better\u201d, Pappalardo says. \u201cMany brands have taken note that women\u2019s media was too white, too fatphobic, too heteronormative, and trying too hard to sell an unrealistic version of \u2018femininity\u2019.\u201d While Reductress\u2019s creative processes remain similar, that particular target is \u201cless a focus of our critique\u201d. Leadership has changed, too, with Newell leaving amid the pandemic in 2020 (she\u2019s since written a book and hosted a podcast about parenting, and is preparing to join the celebrated Upright Citizens Brigade improv troupe next year). Still, Reductress\u2019s outlook \u2013 and its use of humor as a tool for inclusion \u2013 has held steady. New forms of media bring new opportunities for parody, and new ways to grow \u201ca vast community of people who connect with comedy, and whose experiences may not be reflected back to them elsewhere\u201d, Pappalardo says. The site\u2019s biggest audiences are in New York and Los Angeles, with international readers coming from London, Australia and elsewhere. \u201cReductress started as an experimental side project, so I think 2013 me would be surprised that it still exists at all,\u201d Newell says. \u201cI\u2019m glad it still resonates and that so many writers have been able to adapt and transform it to include their voices and causes.\u201d Pappalardo agrees. \u201cSatire isn\u2019t meant to provide solutions to the world\u2019s problems, but it is our job to point them out when we see them,\u201d they say. It \u201ccan also open up sincere, productive dialogue and learning on issues affecting marginalized groups that the broader populace may not be aware of, like the trans experience on Halloween.\u201d As for the next 10 years, Pappalardo says, Reductress aims to keep growing its readership and on to different platforms. A decade ago, the company prioritized web traffic; now, \u201cour commercial business is focused on developing original premium content for digital, film, TV, audio, books, and events,\u201d they say. In other words, as Jesus said before ascending into heaven: \u201cLike and follow for part 2.\u201d",

        "body": "While malnutrition is rightly discussed in the context of poverty in your article (Surge in number of people in hospital with nutrient deficiencies, NHS figures show, 21 December), it\u2019s important that this isn\u2019t at the expense of conversations around disease-related malnutrition \u2013 a significant health issue that has been worsening for decades. A 2022 survey of 1,543 adults across the UK found that 45% of those screened in health and care settings were at risk of malnutrition, including 55% of residents in care homes. Malnutrition prevalence was highest in individuals with cancer, and gastrointestinal and respiratory conditions. The data was collected using the malnutrition universal screening tool, a comprehensive measure of malnutrition risk that can and should be used in all health and social care settings. People at risk of disease-related malnutrition require specific, personalised care plans in which oral nutritional supplements can have a powerful role. These are able to provide micronutrients as well as calories and protein in low volumes, which can be very helpful when illness impacts on appetite. With an ageing population and a growing number of patients with multiple morbidities, nutrition supplements are an important tool to help manage malnutrition and so help reduce hospital stay, complications and to save lives. Hospital data significantly underrecords the frequency of protein energy malnutrition, while data on iron deficiency might reflect issues of iron loss through bleeding as well as insufficient dietary intake. In 2015, a National Institute for Health Research report estimated malnutrition to cost \u00a319.6bn a year, costs that will only have increased. Dr Nick Thompson Consultant gastroenterologist, Newcastle upon Tyne \u2022 I read your report with anger and indignation. It is not right that in 21st-century Britain rickets is on the rise. It is deeply shaming that children are going to school hungry, and just plain wrong that parents are having to choose who in the family to feed. In Newport, virtually every school runs an inhouse food initiative supported by faith and civic groups. People of goodwill are pulling together, but against a background of apathy and hostility from those who should know better. As a country we need to decide where our priorities lie. I hope that those in positions of power and influence reflect on his story, and allow it to shape their priorities. Canon Andrew Lightbown Newport Cathedral \u2022 Re your article (\u2018Children have bowed legs\u2019: hunger worse than ever, says Norwich school, 21 December), in 1924 more than 10,000 people in Norwich were employed in the shoe trade. Yet some children went to school without shoes. Today in Norfolk, the breadbasket of England, children arrive at school hungry because there is no food at home. In 2023, there are bow-legged children with rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency. What have we achieved in 100 years? Cllr Peter Prinsley Bowthorpe Ward, Norwich \u2022 The Royal College of General Practitioners is wrong. We do not need more free school meals or improved affordability of healthy food. We need a fairer, more equitable society in which everybody can afford a decent life. Doctors should know that we need to treat the disease, not the symptoms.

        "body": "Edinburgh\u2019s council leader has called for a new visitor levy to be introduced urgently to help the city fund its festivals, including this weekend\u2019s loss-making Hogmanay street parties. Cammy Day, leader of Edinburgh\u2019s Labour administration, said the proposed visitor levy could help the city raise about \u00a325m in extra funding for services and to subsidise tourism infrastructure. The Scottish parliament is studying plans to empower councils to introduce the UK\u2019s first transient visitor levy, a daily surcharge put on hotel and guesthouse beds very similar to tourism taxes in other European cities. Successive council leaders in Edinburgh have been the most vociferous campaigners for the new powers, arguing that a levy would help the city cope with the 4 million tourists who now visit each year. The council has faced fresh pressure from the organisers of this weekend\u2019s four-day Hogmanay festival \u2013 who predict they will lose \u00a3500,000 staging it \u2013 to increase its subsidies. All its events on New Year\u2019s Day are free. The levy had been resisted by the city\u2019s hoteliers, who argued it would put off tourists at a time of rapidly rising costs. Its supporters counter that the hotel groups which dominate the sector make significant profits in Edinburgh; the city has very high bed-occupancy rates and seasonal prices. Day said he welcomed recent calls from a cross-party committee of MSPs for ministers to rethink their original proposals for an 18-month delay between a city setting up a levy and it coming into force in 2026. But he was disappointed that the committee, in a report published just before Christmas, had not made a final decision on whether the levy should be a flat-rate or a percentage tax on beds per night. Day said he preferred a percentage rate of perhaps 3-4%. A flat rate levy would be regressive since it meant someone staying in a luxury hotel would pay the same rate as someone in a low-cost hostel. He admitted there were also significant demands for the levy to be spent on other public services. Most residents do not benefit from the festivals economy but experience much higher accommodation costs because tourism greatly distorts the property market. Day said the proposed legislation, expected to be passed by Holyrood in 2024, stipulated that any levy had to help support tourism infrastructure. But it could also be spent on improving parks or streets that would be used for festivals. \u201cI say the whole city should benefit. The tax for me is to grow and promote responsible tourism but also to benefit the city,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lobby of people who think the 18-month time period is way too excessive: we\u2019re ready to go now.\u201d The festival, now in its 30th year and famous for its midnight fireworks display and open air concert on New Year\u2019s Eve, to be headlined this year by Pulp, has previously been sponsored by brands such as Johnnie Walker whisky. Bill Burdett-Coutts, one of its organisers, said the Covid crisis and general economic situation had meant commercial sponsors were hard to find, while the event\u2019s costs had grown by 20-25%, making the need for public sector support even more pressing, he said. \u201cWe know the council is cash-strapped, so I understand their position completely,\u201d he added. \u201cI certainly think a tourist tax is a good idea, and if used wisely would be a good thing.\u201d",

        "body": "It\u2019s possible to have a lot of dogs over a long adult life and know even less about them at the end of it than when you started. They\u2019re all so different, almost like people. So, don\u2019t take this as a dog blueprint or, heaven forfend, a guide book \u2013 more a series of facts that will make you a better, more delighted companion. They have magic eyebrows Or rather, as Jules Howard, a zoologist and the author of Wonderdog, says: \u201cThink about the eyebrow as being composed of different sets of muscles. In dogs, one of those muscles is super pumped \u2013 much, much bigger than in any other mammal.\u201d This has the strength to lift up in a \u201creally beautiful way\u201d, Howard says. In the 10,000 to 15,000 years of human-canine interaction, \u201cdogs have evolved a muscle that we recognise as love, or dedication, or \u2018babyness\u2019. It\u2019s an evolution of a childlike face. It\u2019s kind of creepy that it works.\u201d It has most likely taken two to tango The origin story of the domestic dog used to be that humankind, recognising the alert and protective capabilities of the wolf, simply tamed it. Then came the revisionist idea: that they recognised our resource wealth \u2013 we are always amassing food, making it nice, then throwing some of it away \u2013 and essentially tamed us, by being cute (see the eyebrows). There is no \u201cgood art that tells the domestication story\u201d, Howard says, which appears to have happened in Europe and east Asia simultaneously. The canine palaeontologist Darcy Morey blew a hole in the artificial versus natural selection dichotomy (artificial selection would be us breeding dogs for traits, natural would be them adapting to us), arguing for \u201cco-evolution\u201d, driven by what the philosopher Donna Haraway calls \u201ca nasty developmental infection called love\u201d. Dogs are blessed with social genes \u201cWilliams-Beuren is a rare syndrome in one in 18,000 people that makes them super social,\u201d Howard says. \u201cIf you look at that collection of genes in mammals, you see DNA insertions in dogs that you don\u2019t see in wolves. The more mutations they have, the more social they are. Throughout the whole of the dog family, we see lots of insertions in these genes.\u201d Having said that, dogs\u2019 personality traits map very closely to humans\u2019 Stanley Coren, a psychologist and the author of The Intelligence of Dogs, evaluated more than 1,000 dogs, and found the Ocean traits we use to characterise people \u2013 openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (although we no longer use \u201cneuroticism\u201d, preferring a stability-to-instability scale) \u2013 map precisely on to dogs. \u201cSome dogs will go from being perfectly quiet and happy to growling and snapping, and that\u2019s very similar to the human dimension of stability-instability,\u201d he says. \u201cIn theory, we can change each other, but how many marriages do you know that went on the rocks because: \u2018Yes, I knew he was moody when I married him, but I thought I could change that.\u2019 You can\u2019t fight genes. Genes don\u2019t explain everything, but they load the dice.\u201d Forget everything you knew about dominance theory The idea of the family as a pack, in which there is an alpha and all other behaviour shakes down from the pack\u2019s recognition of that, has been peculiarly tenacious in dog husbandry. The theory goes: they have to understand there is a hierarchy in which they are at the bottom and therefore shouldn\u2019t sleep in your bed or eat at the same time. This is true to the degree that all animals have, as Howard explains, \u201can innate understanding of who is best to avoid and who is best to challenge for a food reward or mating reward, but it\u2019s no truer of dogs than it would be of a robin. The problem I have with the alpha male theory is, I think of politics and people like David Cameron.\u201d Which is to say, quite a basic, coarse version of interaction. A dog slotting in to a human household, after millions of years evolving to minimise aggression and obtain food, will have much more sophisticated relationships. Dogs are not obligate carnivores and usually don\u2019t need as much protein as they get As a result of the first misperception \u2013 that a perfect, \u201cnatural\u201d dog diet is entirely meat \u2013 pet food has been developed to have way too much protein. A lot of mainstream brands are 40% protein, whereas dogs do best at about 18% as adults (22% as puppies). This messes with their gut microbiome (yes, they also have one of those), causes inflammation and damages their kidney function. An \u2018intelligent\u2019 breed is actually a biddable breed Border collies and Australian cattle dogs are renowned for their incredible skill sets and are often described in human-adjacent terms intellectually, eg \u201cas intelligent as a three-year-old\u201d. But when they DNA-swabbed the highly trained dogs, these breeds were simply more obedient than others. In other words, your own dog could probably herd a sheep; it\u2019s just choosing not to. Your three-year-old, meanwhile, would be terrible at it. Can your dog really talk? Not in the way you think So-called \u201cbutton dogs\u201d \u2013 you can see them on Instagram \u2013 will, put in front of a mat with buttons that say words, reliably hit \u201cwalk\u201d or \u201couch\u201d or \u201ctreat\u201d, to the extent that it almost looks like we have broken the final frontier and can talk to one another. A large-scale study that is under way at the University of California San Diego is already confident that the button presses are not random. However, Amritha Mallikarjun, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, counsels: \u201cWhen we use a human linguistic interface, we start ascribing too much to our joint understanding of these words.\u201d There is no evidence to suggest that they know \u201clove\u201d means love; they just know what the sound leads to (food, probably). Never mind the word, though: the love is real The breakthrough study was in 2010, where dogs were fMRI-scanned while looking at an image of a person they \u201cloved\u201d. In humans, a similar image would light up our caudate nucleus; the same was true in dogs. In 2020, a study combined fMRI with eye-tracking and behavioural preference, and discovered that the bond between a dog and its human caregiver was remarkably like the attachment bond between human infants and their mothers. They don\u2019t just love you, in other words; they really, really love you. They do not, however, feel guilty Everyone thinks their dog has a guilt face and that this corresponds to their bad behaviour, but it\u2019s much more likely that they are just reading your angry cue and recognise themselves as its hapless cause. In order to feel remorse, they would have to be capable of an original betrayal. \u201cPeople who study monkeys and apes are always looking for signs of deception,\u201d Howard says \u2013 and they find it. \u201cThere\u2019s no strong evidence that dogs can do that. Their depth of contemplative intelligence is not the same as apes.\u201d Dogs can be traumatised I spend a lot of time watching bros on TikTok who find abused dogs tied up underneath trailers, then restore them to their natural state of joy. It\u2019s a magical process; all it takes is a flea treatment and a whole heap of love and everything is forgotten. This is not, unfortunately, the case. \u201cThere was a 10-year experiment done in the 60s,\u201d Howard says, \u201cwhere they reared up generations of dogs and treated them in different ways \u2013 some in solitary confinement, some banned from contact with humans. Those dogs who were mistreated, even the ones who had a bad incident with another dog, were clearly traumatised. They were the most unpredictable; they were the least likely to wag their tails. The result of that study was so convincing that in the US dogs stopped being used as research animals.\u201d If your dog is trying to tell you something, don\u2019t ignore it \u201cWe know this as a fact,\u201d says Robert Alleyne, a dog behaviourist. \u201cThere are dogs who can detect epilepsy; there are cancer bio-detection dogs.\u201d This became newly fascinating during Covid, when French researchers found a sensitivity rating of 97% in dogs, which was higher than any of the 15 antigen tests available at that time. Alleyne goes on to note, anecdotally, that his dog could smell depression. \u201cWhenever I felt down, I could see that he would recognise it. He would keep his head on my knee for an hour, saying: \u2018I understand.\u2019\u201d Dogs are one-trial learners with very long memories \u201cA lot of choices they make are the result of something that happened in the past,\u201d Alleyne says, \u201cand it only needs to have happened once.\u201d Sometimes this is useful. For instance, my dog once found a whole sausage roll in a Greggs bag and will now chase after the branding in any circumstance. Newsflash \u2013 very often there is a bit of pastry in there. But it also means that one act of aggression from another dog can lead to a lifelong fear response, so intervene early. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why we get it so wrong with dogs,\u201d Alleyne says. \u201cAlthough they are simplistic creatures, sometimes we think they\u2019re too simple.\u201d Dogs recognise siblings, but not necessarily as siblings \u201cDogs have a part of the brain that\u2019s very good at pack recognition,\u201d Howard says. This can span long periods of absence \u2013 years, even. But the shared-parent thing? Nope, we have no way of knowing. Dogs communicate anxiety well \u2013 we just need to get better at noticing \u201cAll of us could get better at reading dogs,\u201d Howard says. \u201cWe\u2019re really good at reading one another, but dogs are like us \u2013 they\u2019ve evolved to be really expressive. Even how a tail wags is a great way to understand how the dog is feeling. There is a lot of anxiety in dogs and a lot of behaviour we should take more seriously than we do. Dogs whining if they\u2019re left on their own \u2013 that\u2019s probably not OK.\u201d Dogs can tell the time (sort of) It\u2019s a puzzle of separation anxiety that a dog that can be left for 40 minutes will go bananas at 41 minutes. This is related to the concentration of the owner\u2019s smell in the air, which will dissipate at a stable rate. Also, says Vanessa Woods, the co-author of Survival of the Friendliest: \u201cLike people, dogs have a body clock in which their body creates digestive enzymes in a regular way,\u201d so they will be able to plot the passage of time through how hungry they are. But no, they don\u2019t know it\u2019s midnight. Dogs can empathise This is the simplest test imaginable: yawn at your dog and it will start yawning. \u201cContagious yawning is related to empathy scores in adults,\u201d Woods says. \u201cIn one study, more than 70% of dogs yawned when they saw someone yawning.\u201d Dogs can laugh The neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, researching laughter in nonhuman mammals, found that the laugh-like sound that dogs make when they are panting, played to other dogs, reduces stress and increases tail-wagging, play bows and general prosocial behaviour. Dogs should never eat raisins There are a number of foods you are told never to give your dog, mainly chocolate, and they seem to wrap their jaws around them periodically, to no ill effect. Don\u2019t make this your one-trial learning. It feels seasonal to point out that raisins and grapes can cause liver failure or, at the very least, an incredibly expensive out-of-hours vet visit.",

        "body": "Originally from the UK, Sonia never intended to move to France. After many years of travelling, and a long stint living in Dubai, she went to Belley in eastern France in July 2020 to visit family. But when pandemic lockdown rules changed, it was difficult for her to leave. \u201cI ended up staying and helping to start a bed and breakfast with my brother\u2019s mother-in-law,\u201d she says. In the spring of 2022, she went out for dinner with a friend, where she met the owner, Olivier, who had moved to the area from Paris to open his restaurant. \u201cI really liked the restaurant because the staff accommodated my vegetarianism, which was a hard thing to find in France!\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really quiet, so we ended up chatting to Olivier over the countertop.\u201d At the time, she says, her French wasn\u2019t good. \u201cOlivier was talking about life and future plans. I didn\u2019t understand it all but I thought: \u2018Oh my God, he\u2019s cute and funny.\u2019\u201d Luckily, he thought exactly the same about Sonia. \u201cAt one point, she asked me if I was looking for a wife and I went bright red,\u201d he says, laughing. Before they left, he offered to cook for her again. \u201cI was feeling shy, so I gave my phone number to her friend to pass on.\u201d Sonia\u2019s friend suggested she get in touch with him, but she was \u201cvery British\u201d about it and thought he should contact her. \u201cSix weeks after first talking to him at his restaurant, I hadn\u2019t heard anything. I had the strong feeling that he fancied me and I wanted to see him again, so I sent a message suggesting we have tea,\u201d she says. Because Olivier never drank tea, he had to rush out to buy a teapot. Having been divorced 10 years earlier, Sonia wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to jump into anything; she was content on her own. But despite the language barrier, she and Olivier connected straight away. \u201cI have no idea what we talked about, but there was this huge sensation that it was right,\u201d says Sonia. \u201cIt encouraged me to learn more French \u2013 I started taking classes.\u201d Olivier says Sonia was \u201cfriendly with no drama. We felt naturally compatible and both have a big interest in food.\u201d They met again a few days later at the chateau where Sonia was living. \u201cWe had a little walk in the woods and I just knew that I definitely wanted to be with him. That was the first day we kissed,\u201d she says. In the months that followed, Sonia focused on learning French while Olivier learned English. This gave them the chance to get to know each other better. \u201cAs our language improved, there were no more miscommunications,\u201d she says. \u201cOur relationship grew stronger and I moved in with Olivier that summer.\u201d Olivier believes that meeting as an older couple encouraged them to move quickly. \u201cI think you have to go fast, because we know that life is short,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re happy in your relationship, every minute is important and you want to be with the person you love as much as possible.\u201d The couple now live in Ceyz\u00e9rieu, surrounded by mountains, and enjoy \u201ca simple life\u201d. \u201cWe go to Lyon for the shops or cinema, but otherwise we are happy in our field, in our wellies. We are surrounded by people who make cheese and honey and wine, which we love.\u201d Olivier says they also love being in the garden, \u201csurrounded by nature\u201d, and having people over for food. Having closed his restaurant, he now cooks for private clients, while Sonia teaches English. She has two sons who live in Canada and Dubai; Olivier has a son who lives nearby, plus a young grandson the couple see regularly. Olivier loves that his partner is \u201chappy all the time, from the beginning of the day to the end\u201d. He says that she is a \u201ctotally free spirit. We are different by culture, but she helps me discover things and be open-minded.\u201d Sonia says that if they had met 20 years before they did, they might not be together. \u201cWe\u2019ve softened over the years and we\u2019re grateful for this second chance at love,\u201d she says. \u201cI like that I can be myself with him and I don\u2019t have to tone down my personality. I feel so young and silly with him; it\u2019s like being 21 again.\u201d",

        "body": "Viciously anodyne but not entirely unamusing, this older-folk-skewed comedy puts a gentle spin on a well-worn device, the magical-body transformation. In some genteel corner of England, retirees Joan and Arthur are leading a life of quiet resignation. She does gardening and whatnot; he potters with inventions in his shed. One night, his latest concoction, a formula mixed with whisky that will de-age a person back to the body she or he had in her or his early 20s, actually works. Arthur goes outside to holler triumphantly during a storm and gets struck by lightning, leaving Joan a widow. After the funeral, Joan (Patricia Hodge) and her two best friends, crafty divorcee Linda (Diane Keaton) and baking-obsessive Susan (Lulu), get stuck into the whisky/youthifying brew and wake up looking like the lithe young women they once were, played by three new actors: Esme Lonsdale as young Joan, Genevieve Gaunt as young Linda and Hannah Howland as young Susan. After a predictable bout of screaming and working out that the effect doesn\u2019t last more than six hours, they soon start to enjoy feeling stronger and healthier. (There\u2019s a funny gag that has Linda just repeatedly getting out of a chair and sitting down again, burbling with delight in finding it doesn\u2019t hurt.) The attentions of male suitors at a club, however, are not always welcome but Susan meets a handsome, middle-aged stud muffin who shares her passion for food, Joan considers looking up an old flame, and Linda pays a spiteful visit to her ex-husband in order to taunt him about turning 70. The climax wraps up most of the threads in Las Vegas where the women go for a last hurrah as the whisky runs out where they meet a cheerful drag queen and see Boy George on stage. The cast, from the leads down to the bit players, feels pretty random, and some might wonder if the ensemble hasn\u2019t gone through a number of transformations between greenlight and the wrap party. But the core threesome have a pleasant chemistry and are pros enough to make it work for an audience unlikely to be especially critical. \u2022 Arthur\u2019s Whisky is released on 1 January on Sky Cinema.",

Now he promises \u201can amateur\u2019s guide to staying alive \u2026 fuelled by class, queerness and fatness\u201d. His podcast is an antidote to what he describes as \u201cdelusional positivity\u201d. Framing sanity as a house of cards, looking at how self-pity could help with healing, and showing how capitalism has exploited sadness, it\u2019s thoughtful, helpful and forthright. Hannah Verdier The Pirate of Prague Widely available, episodes weekly If you\u2019re in need of a holiday binge, this Apple Original about a charming Czech conman who persuaded the wealthy to invest in an oil company has been a true-crime slowburner. In six episodes there are Aspen parties, suitcases full of cash and rich people trying to get richer, ripe for exploitation by smooth-talking Viktor Ko\u017een\u00fd. HV Trace of Doubt Audible, all episodes available Twenty-three years ago, author Samantha Weinberg was on her way to interview a murder suspect \u2013 of whose guilt she was certain. Now, she\u2019s looking back into the case where a British DNA scientist was murdered in her Californian garden. It\u2019s a twisty, slick series, in which her views are turned on their head. Alexi Duggins Moonkarta Widely available, all episodes available This surreally inventive children\u2019s podcast has an almost Mighty Boosh-like quality to its daft character voices, whimsical comic moments and oddball references. No wonder, given that its chronicle of the adventures of a character called Splott was created by a duo whose credits include Toast of London and Motherland. AD Who Killed JFK? Widely available, episodes weekly One of America\u2019s most enduring stories as told by one of America\u2019s greatest storytellers. Film-maker Rob Reiner investigates the assassination of President John F Kennedy (above) 60 years after it happened. He teams up with journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien, and they speak to CIA officials and a secret service agent, to follow the new leads that continue to be discovered. Hollie Richardson There\u2019s a podcast for that This week, Hannah Verdier picks five of the best podcasts hosted by families, from welcoming chefs to inclusive drag queens Stirring It Up with Andi &amp; Miquita Oliver Who wouldn\u2019t want to pop round mother-and-daughter duo Andi and Miquita Oliver\u2019s house for dinner? Their warm and welcoming podcast has gone from strength to strength, with glorious guests including Kathy Burke, Lemn Sissay and Elizabeth Day sitting down for a chat around the dinner table. While Miquita mixes the drinks, Andi brings the food, with honey-baked chicken and pan-fried seabass among the dishes on the menu. It\u2019s a comforting cue for easy conversations that switch from vulnerable confessions to lovable cackles in each episode. The Therapy Crouch If lovingly bickering is the key to a successful marriage, then Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch are in it for the long run. As podcasting couples go, these two need no script \u2013 they\u2019re funnier than some comedians. They also have a knack for letting enough slip about their celebrity marriage to grab a headline or two. Ralph the puppy, their latest addition, unites them in love and divides them in a crate-training debate, with Crouch being relegated into ninth place in their family\u2019s priorities. From moustache styling to beige flags, these two never run out of things to talk about. Sisters Kaitlin Prest\u2019s The Heart is one of the finest podcasts out there and Sisters, a five-part examination of her relationship with her sibling Natalie, is intimate, warm and highly nuanced. Their sisterly bond is realistic and relatable, with mostly off-the-cuff conversations over a period of two years. Although there\u2019s so much love between the two, Kaitlin accurately describes the feeling of being replaced by her younger sister, while Natalie recalls trying to copy her sister because she looked up to her. It\u2019s particularly fascinating to see how easily the pair fall into their old sibling roles as adults. Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware Only a pair of formidable women would serve Nigella Lawson her own pasta recipe, but mother and daughter force of nature Jessie and Lennie Ware are not known for sitting back and being quiet. While Jessie brings the pop-star creds, it\u2019s Lennie who will ask their guests anything she fancies \u2013 and her charm means she gets away with it every time. From quizzing Miriam Margolyes about why she has so much wind to pinning down Sadiq Khan\u2019s political ambitions, Mama Ware is unstoppable. Splitting her airtime between poking at her daughter and building rapport with guests, it\u2019s a recipe for fun. Sibling Rivalry Friends are the family you choose \u2013 and treasured relationships don\u2019t come much closer than the sisterly dynamic between Bob the Drag Queen and Mon\u00e9t X Change. Hilarious, outrageous, ultimately supportive: these two are all the drag queen tropes and more. Not being actual sisters doesn\u2019t stop them from bickering like they are, but behind all the acerbic one-liners are two people who are always ready to talk about inequality and speak up about being Black and queer in America today.

        "body": "David Leland was a master of understatement with a social conscience and wildly wicked sense of humour, arising like his friends the Pythons from our everyday humdrum British universe in the 60s and 70s. More than 40 years ago I saw the astonishing Made in Britain. The film that made Tim Roth \u2013 who played a violent skinhead \u2013 a star, was written by Leland for the producer and director Alan Clarke. It was a a biting attack on rightwing Thatcherite policies and it is just as relevant to today\u2019s brutal system. A few years later I had the privilege to see Wish You Were Here (1987) David\u2019s directorial debut, a hilarious but poignant film drama based on the early teenage life of the brothel keeper and party hostess Cynthia Payne. David also wrote it and the film introduced another new young actor Emily Lloyd to the world of cinema. I released the movie as a distributor to incredible reviews after its Cannes premiere. Almost simultaneously I was working with Neil Jordan on an idea which became Mona Lisa. Neil had come to an impasse with the script, so I suggested we ask my new friend David to give us a hand. They worked together to create a wonderful screenplay for Bob Hoskins to give the performance of his life, that won him best actor awards at the Baftas, Golden Globes and Cannes and earned him an Oscar nomination. We teamed up again as I was a producer and David directed an adaptation of The Big Man in 1989 for Liam Neeson to shine as an unemployed Scottish miner who takes part in an illegal bare-knuckle fight to save his family and resurrect his pride. David did an amazing job. The common theme in all of these movies was David\u2019s fierce determination to support and highlight the underdog, using stories told with a dark, quirky sense of humour. I don\u2019t think I have laughed as much as when we made The Big Man on location in Glasgow with David\u2019s clever observations on everyday life and his characteristic understatement always coming to the fore. I will always remember calling him from Rome with the terrific news that Ennio Morricone had agreed to write our score and David deadpanned with his deep baritone from the set: \u201cI\u2019m very, very excited.\u201d He genuinely was! I will miss his witty but gentle philosophical intelligence. I\u2019m sorry our paths didn\u2019t professionally cross again after the 80s. But I know that everyone who ever met David was touched by his matter-of-fact pragmatism and his kind and acute sense of the absurdities of the human race. He was a terrific writer and director and a lovely man who will be greatly missed by his family and friends.",

        "body": "Ohio\u2019s governor, Mike DeWine, on Friday vetoed a bill by fellow Republicans that would have banned gender-confirming healthcare for minors in the state, and prohibited transgender athletes from taking part in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports. The surprise move, which DeWine said was \u201cultimately about protecting human life\u201d, was largely welcomed by pro-LGBTQ+ activists, although the governor indicated he still intended to enact some of the provisions of the bill through executive action. DeWine announced the veto at a news conference on Friday morning, in which he said he had listened to people on both sides of the legislation who believed their position best protected children. \u201cWere I to sign, Ohio would be saying that the state, that the government, knows what is best medically for a child rather than the two people who love that child the most, the parents,\u201d he said. \u201cMany parents have told me that their child would be dead today if they had not received the treatment they received from an Ohio children\u2019s hospital. I have also been told, by those that are now grown adults, that but for this care, they would have taken their lives when they were teenagers.\u201d DeWine said he believed the law was \u201cnot in the best interests of Ohioans\u201d. Republicans have enough of a majority in the state legislature to ultimately override the veto, but it was not immediately clear whether or when they would attempt to do so. In a tweet, the ACLU of Ohio said: \u201cThank you Mike DeWine. Ohio is home. Protect trans youth.\u201d The Human Rights Campaign said it was \u201ca huge win for trans youth and their families in Ohio\u201d. Restrictions or outright bans on gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth have passed in more than 20 Republican-controlled legislatures nationwide since 2021, the Associated Press reports, making DeWine\u2019s resistance a break with precedent. Many of the actions have become the subject of legal challenges, with a growing number of judges blocking laws passed by conservative states. In Ohio, minors would have been banned from taking puberty blockers and undergoing other hormone therapies, or receiving gender-confirmation surgery to further align them with their gender identities, according to the bill that passed with only Republican support. Those already receiving care would have been allowed to continue. Opponents branded the bill as \u201ccruel\u201d, with dozens of doctors and mental health professionals, parents of transgender children and transgender youths giving testimony. Despite the veto, DeWine said he would take administrative actions that would address some provisions of the bill and \u201chave a better chance of surviving judicial review and being adopted\u201d. He said he was directing state agencies to ban gender-confirmation surgery for people under age 18; that he will require \u201crelevant agencies\u201d to report to the legislature information about minors and adults seeking gender-confirmation healthcare; and that his administration will prevent \u201cpop-up clinics or fly-by-night operations\u201d to ensure families receive \u201cadequate counseling\u201d over gender-confirmation care. \u201cI adamantly agree with the general assembly that no surgery of this kind should ever be performed on those under the age of 18,\u201d DeWine said. Similar to passing restrictions on transgender healthcare, numerous Republican-controlled states have acted to ban transgender athletes from women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports at school and college levels. In Florida last month, high school students protested in support of staff suspended for allowing a transgender athlete to play on a volleyball team. The Biden administration hopes to formalize a proposal into Title IX legislation next year that would effectively nullify state bans on transgender athletes.

        "body": "I\u2019m the eldest of four kids from Portsmouth, and, growing up, we\u2019d all fight for our father\u2019s attention by trying to impress him in our endeavours, whether that was playing sports or singing. That competitive nature stayed with me \u2013 I\u2019ve always enjoyed boxing and rugby, and when I joined the Royal Naval Reserve, I took part in a field gun competition, racing with antique guns through a number of obstacles. That\u2019s where I met my friend Ginge, who holds the record for the fastest climb of every peak in Africa. He co-founded the Edgar Evans Club in 2015 for ex-service personnel to take part in eccentric events in sleepy towns across the UK and raise money for local charities. Perhaps the weirdest was the Elver Eating World Championships in Gloucestershire \u2013 the eels were cooked with butter and garlic, and were actually quite tasty. I came second, but I wanted to win, so I told Ginge I should compete in something more suited to my skills. He suggested the World Pea Throwing Championships, which are held in a pub in Lewes, East Sussex \u2013 no one knows exactly when they began, but some say about 40 years ago. \u201cWith your boxing skills and the size of your limbs, you should be good at that,\u201d Ginge said. So in 2015, when I was 33, I began researching how to get small objects to travel a long way, and how much velocity you can generate if you throw them. I practised with a ball bearing, as it could travel further than anything else I tried. The competition takes place in a narrow cobbled street outside the pub, lined with pea spotters stood side by side for about 40 metres holding tape measures. There were around 30 to 40 competitors from all over the world: Welsh, Scottish, Irish, South African, German and Dutch. We each had to pick a pea from a glass. The landlady looked bemused as I took my time picking the one I wanted to throw, choosing a perfectly round pea. The only rule is not to step beyond the throwing line. We had to beat the record of 26 metres. I was a bit nervous \u2013 Ginge had put pressure on me to win after I\u2019d come second in the elver-eating championships. Each competitor gets three attempts. My first throw came in at 24 metres, with my second at 26 metres. My third ended up being the winning throw, which came in at 28.6 metres. With that, I\u2019d won the world championships, and came away with the infamous plaster of paris trophy \u2013 a gold hand holding a pea. To my mind, if you throw a javelin, it\u2019s very different from throwing a shot put, which is very different from skimming a stone. So there\u2019s definitely a special technique to throwing peas \u2013 though I prefer to keep mine to myself as I want to win again. But it\u2019s ultimately all about delivering the best velocity, having long limbs and generating a lot of power from your arm as quickly as possible. Because I\u2019m 6ft 3in, with bloody long arms, I\u2019ve got an unfair advantage. Cricketers, golfers, boxers and anyone who plays racket sports would do very well in pea throwing because it\u2019s all about how quickly you can move your hand. It\u2019s not the most serious of sports, but winning felt like a minor achievement. I celebrated with a couple of pints of bitter. I now live by the maxim: \u201cGive peas a chance.\u201d Two years later, after training a lot, I went to defend my title and was joined by an ex-navy mate who\u2019s also a boxer. I thought he might beat me, but I was at an advantage in terms of having longer limbs to generate the power to throw. My second throw was the current pea-throwing record at 44 metres, which still stands today. I haven\u2019t been able to attend the event since, but I fully intend to go back to win my third title. I\u2019ve also tried out other quirky competitions, like welly throwing, which I was terrible at. There\u2019s a gravy-wrestling championship up north that I want to try. I love the element of theatre and playing to an audience while making a spectacle of myself \u2013 I just like the attention, really. But these things are always worth trying \u2013 you might go back home with a world championship under your belt, and that\u2019s always a great story to tell over a pint. \u2022 As told to Yousif Nur Do you have an experience to share?

        "body": "I haven\u2019t used this pun yet this year and even though it\u2019s taken me right up to the last few minutes of possible deployment, I am glad I kept my powder dry \u2013 because Men Up is definitely this year\u2019s Christmas cracker. The 90-minute tale of the first trial (in Morriston Hospital, Swansea, in 1994) of the drug that would become Viagra, is short, sweet and altogether lovely. Though it never loses its twinkle, it plays the matter straight and \u2013 while the characters may joke about their situations \u2013 never for laughs. Tonally, it\u2019s a masterpiece by writer Matthew Barry and director Ashley Way that never undercuts or overeggs a moment. The story coheres round a handful of men who, after trying the various treatments on offer in the early 90s for their erectile dysfunction (penis injections, inflatable rods, a literal pump in the scrotum, pellets up the urethra), leap at the chance to try a potential cure in pill form. Soon Meurig (Iwan Rheon), whose failure to thrive is a consequence of his diabetes, though his wife (Alexandra Roach) fears it is a reaction to her double mastectomy after breast cancer, and his fellow sufferers find themselves hooked up to \u201cstrain gauges\u201d, popping pills, watching porn and waiting for magic to happen. For most, eventually, it does. For others, the disappointment threatens to overwhelm everything. What unfolds is a gentle, compassionate but witty examination of the importance placed \u2013 by men, by society, by women (though I\u2019d like to talk further about that one) \u2013 on the presence or absence of erections and the capacity or incapacity for penetrative sex. And from there, an equally kindly but acute interrogation of the narrow definitions of masculinity we work within, the inflexibility and absurdity of them, the needless misery caused by falling outside the lines. More impressively still, Barry\u2019s script makes poignantly clear the difference between sex and intimacy. The restoration of boners solves only one problem and often, it turns out, not the true one. Widowed Colin\u2019s (Steffan Rhodri) pills allow him to move beyond phone sex with his new lady friend, but it is the love he and his late wife shared, despite years without him being able to \u201cperform\u201d (as if men were actors \u2013 or seals), that carries him through. And it is what allows him to help a despairing man for whom the new drug does not work. The rarely depicted intimacy of unembarrassed male friendship is almost the most moving element of Men Up. But there is also the rare sight of marriages in difficulties but set fair to overcome them. And of ordinary men wrestling with problems without turning to drink, or violence, or into monsters. And of the deep wounds unthinking cruelties can inflict \u2013 for example when Tommy (Paul Rhys), whose long-term partner is a man, must lie to get on the trial because the protocol dictates that only heterosexuals qualify. Not only are those tramlines narrow, but they must also lead only to vaginas. What a world. All this and a great opening turn by Katy Wix as Meurig\u2019s obtuse therapist. Men Up is a lovingly made thing, full of delicately poised performances that allow the whole to pivot from funny to sad and back again without the smallest wobble. What a lovely way to end the year. \u2022 Men Up is on BBC One and iPlayer",

        "body": "Good morning, and welcome to the last edition of this newsletter for the year (and fear not, we\u2019ll be back next week, in what sources say will be 2024). 2023 was, among many, many other things, the year that brought Labor back down to Earth. Who knows what\u2019s coming next \u2013 some good TV at least. We hope you\u2019ve enjoyed our picks of interesting stuff from around the Guardian every Saturday. If you have, consider forwarding this email to a friend! Friends love emails. And here\u2019s what I thought looked good this week. Put on one of the tracks you may have missed this year, maybe rustle yourself up a Bill Granger summer brunch (RIP) and treat yourself to some weekend reading. 1. Nude public baths \u2013 was Australia ever ready? The traditional Japanese bathhouse Ofuroya was the country\u2019s first when it opened in Collingwood in 1998. \u201cI remember all my friends at the time telling me that it couldn\u2019t work here,\u201d 78-year-old founder Hiromi Masuoka says \u2013 \u201cthat Australians would not cope well with the nudity aspect.\u201d But as James Norman writes, Ofuroya became a beloved inner-Melbourne sanctuary, one that lasted 25 years. What is Japanese bathing? The tradition is generally traced back to Buddhist purification rituals in the sixth century, \u201cbelieved to cleanse the body and spirit through heat and steam\u201d. Today, onsens (natural outdoor bathing pools) and sentos (public baths) can be found in most Japanese towns and cities, where Norman notes they also act as community meeting places. How long will it take to read: two or so minutes 2. Yes to romance, no to tech Out: empiricism, algorithms and smartphones. In: \u201castrology, art and a life lived fiercely offline\u201d. Ross Barkan thinks the zeitgeist is changing. Turbulent times, he posits (are they ever not?), make for rebellion. In a piece both notably pro-Substack and (weirdly) anti-Fauci, he suggests we\u2019re heading for something like a rerun of 19th-century romanticism, where poets and painters railed against a dehumanised, industrialised future with, well, poems and paintings. Today, he says, art is once again the key. \u201cBacklash is bubbling against tech\u2019s dominance of everyday life, particularly the godlike algorithms that rule all of digital existence.\u201d Not sure where I stand on this take, honestly. Excitingly idealist, or just a false binary? Tell us what you think, at australia.newsletters@theguardian.com. How long will it take to read: four minutes 3. Mythbusting: anti-Zionism is not antisemitism Kurds don\u2019t have their own state, nor do Basques, Catalans, Scots, Kashmiris, Tibetans, Abkhazians, Ossetians, Tamils \u2026 yet, Peter Beinart argues, \u201cbarely anyone suggests that opposing a Kurdish or Catalan state makes you an anti-Kurdish or anti-Catalan bigot\u201d. It\u2019s been four years since Beinart grappled with the dangerous tangling of anti-Zionism and antisemitism. Amid the still-unfolding devastation in Israel and Palestine after 7 October, his bleakly timeless piece became one of this year\u2019s most-read stories from the Guardian\u2019s long reads archive. \u201cAll over the world, it is an alarming time to be Jewish,\u201d the editor-at-large of progressive US magazine Jewish Currents wrote in 2019. \u201cBut conflating anti-Zionism with Jew-hatred is a tragic mistake.\u201d It\u2019s a conflation that keeps on coming up. Per Beinart, it rests on three pillars: that \u201copposing Zionism is antisemitic because it denies to Jews what every other people enjoys: a state of its own\u201d; that to \u201ctake away that statehood once achieved\u201d is bigoted; and that, lastly, \u201cas a practical matter, the two animosities (anti-Zionism and antisemitism) simply go together\u201d. His analysis carefully examines each. How long will it take to read: seven minutes Further reading: As always, you can find many perspectives on and full coverage of the current Israel-Palestine conflict here. 4. Packaged up: the \u2018weird but true\u2019 history of cereal Eating sugary snacks first thing in the morning: yay or nay? Another thing 2023 was, apparently, was the 160th anniversary of cereal. Matthew Cantor goes deep on its American beginnings \u2013 \u201ca culinary history deeply intertwined with the history of US advertising\u201d. A good hook: \u201cLike all good stories, the history of cereal begins with an anti-masturbation campaigner,\u201d he writes. OK, go on. How long will it take to read: three minutes 5. How to win the Google Street View comp Name that spot! That exact one! Competitors at the GeoGuessr World Cup are given a Google Street View image that could be anywhere on Earth, and asked to identify the location. They can zoom in and pan around \u2013 but can\u2019t zoom out \u2013 for added context. So, as Ralph Jones discovers, they look for clues: in \u201cbrick houses, distinctive trousers and unusual telegraph poles\u201d. Who\u2019s the best? GeoGuessr\u2019s most public champion goes by the striking name of Trevor Rainbolt, a 25-year-old who tells Jones he has spent more than 10,000 hours playing. (\u201cThat he didn\u2019t think he was good enough to enter the World Cup tells you all you need to know about the other players,\u201d Jones adds.) How long will it take to read: five-and-a-half minutes Well, that\u2019s all for now. Have a lovely weekend, and a wonderful New Year.

        "body": "The co-founder of the Glastonbury festival, a bestselling novelist and an organ-playing TikTok sensation are among the recipients of New Year honours from the world of arts and culture. Michael Eavis, 88, who first hosted the Pilton Pop, Blues &amp; Folk festival at Worthy Farm in 1970, was recognised for services to music and charity. In an interview with the official Glastonbury website, Sir Michael said his daughter Emily, with whom he runs the Glastonbury music festival, had brought him the official letter about his knighthood, adding: \u201cI was really surprised to see it, actually. Why did they choose me I wonder?\u201d He added: \u201cWhat can I say, really? I\u2019ve done quite a lot of stuff in my life and I\u2019ve always been fairly sure that I was doing the right thing.\u201d Leona Lewis, the singer-songwriter who won the third series of The X Factor in 2006, has been made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to music and to charity. Lewis grew up in Islington and, after being recognised for her vocal ability on the TV talent contest, became a seven-time Brit award nominee and was nominated three times for a Grammy award. Also in music, Anna Lapwood, 28, a renowned organist, conductor and TikTok sensation who has challenged sexism in her industry, said it was a \u201chuge privilege\u201d to be on the honours list for an MBE. Lapwood, the director of music at Pembroke College, Cambridge, said: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t quite believe it and it\u2019s still sinking in, I guess.\u201d She was the first female organ scholar at Magdalen College, Oxford, in its 560-year history and is now an associate artist of the Royal Albert Hall and also a conductor at Pembroke College. She has introduced the organ to a new audience on TikTok, where she has more than 690,000 followers and amassed more than 21m likes. Other showbiz names honoured include the radio DJ Tony Blackburn, who is made an OBE, fellow radio DJ Steve Wright, and Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood, who both are made MBEs. The author Kate Mosse received a CBE, which she said was a recognition of the importance of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction, of which she is a co-founder. The novelist, 62, whose books have been translated into 38 languages and published in more than 40 countries, is best known for the Languedoc Trilogy \u2013 Labyrinth, Sepulchre and Citadel \u2013 and The Joubert Family Chronicles \u2013 The Burning Chambers, The City Of Tears and The Ghost Ship. She has been made a CBE for services to literature, to women and to charity. The Women\u2019s prize for fiction is now one of the biggest literary prizes in the world. Mosse said everybody involved in it \u201cdeserves all the accolades they could have\u201d, as she applauded the \u201cgroup effort\u201d. She added: \u201cQuite often those things do get overlooked, not deliberately, but just there isn\u2019t a system for them. \u201cSo it does feel that although obviously this is for me, it\u2019s very much an acknowledgment of the importance of the Women\u2019s prize, and that it matters that women support other women.\u201d Elsewhere in literature, the bestselling author Alexander McCall Smith was knighted. The creator of The No 1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency series as well as the 44 Scotland Street novels has been given a knighthood for services to literature, academia and charity. In film and television, the director and producer Sir Ridley Scott, whose works include Gladiator, Alien and Napoleon, is made a Knight Grand Cross, upgrading his previous knighthood, while Game Of Thrones actor Oliver Ford Davies has said he is \u201chonoured\u201d to be made an OBE. The performer, 84, best known for his Shakespearean stage work, found new fans as Maester Cressen in the HBO fantasy series and as Sio Bibble in the Star Wars prequel trilogy films released in 1999, 2002 and 2005. He has been recognised for services to drama. Elsewhere in the arts, British artist Brian Clarke and Gregory Doran, the artistic director emeritus of the Royal Shakespeare Company, both received knighthoods.

        "body": "The Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer was suggested as a mediator in the fight by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government to prevent the publication of Spycatcher, the memoirs of former MI5 officer Peter Wright, according to newly released official papers. The offer was made by Wright\u2019s Australian counsel \u2013 and future Australian prime minister \u2013 Malcolm Turnbull as part of a proposed out-of-court settlement, files released by the National Archives show. The young lawyer was propelled to international prominence with his aggressive cross-examination of Britain\u2019s most senior civil servant, Sir Robert Armstrong, in the government\u2019s ultimately doomed attempt to obtain an injunction banning publication of the Wright memoirs. During the course of the five-week trial in Sydney in the autumn of 1986, Armstrong, the cabinet secretary, famously admitted one of his statements had been \u201ceconomical with the truth\u201d \u2013 a comment eagerly seized on as proof of British duplicity. In a telegram to London towards the end of his witness box ordeal, the mandarin disclosed that Turnbull had approached the government\u2019s counsel Theo Simos with an offer of talks with a view to reaching a settlement. He said Turnbull\u2019s proposal would involve Thatcher recognising the problem of \u201cold spooks wanting to tell their stories\u201d and agreeing to set up a committee of inquiry. The aim would be to move to a system similar to that in the US, where ex-CIA officers could publish provided they had permission from their former employer. Turnbull said that if she agreed, Thatcher would be seen as \u201ca champion of freedom of information and freedom of speech\u201d, while he would do his best to say that Armstrong had done \u201ca splendid job\u201d. \u201cVery good of him, I must say,\u201d the Whitehall mandarin drily noted. He said Turnbull, who was a legal adviser to Packer\u2019s media empire, had added that the tycoon \u2013 best known in Britain for his rebel World Series Cricket \u2013 \u201ccould mediate if that were necessary\u201d. There was little enthusiasm for the proposal on the British side. Armstrong noted the closing words of the judge that day, quoting the Roman poet Virgil: \u201cTimeo Danaos et dona ferentes\u201d \u2013 beware of Greeks bearing gifts. \u201cWe certainly need to view Turnbull\u2019s proposition in that light,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cThere is not much enthusiasm here for starting down this course. We do not trust our Greek.\u201d In London, Thatcher and her senior ministers quickly decided that a settlement on such terms was \u201cout of the question\u201d. \u201cThe government could not compromise on its point of principle that a member of the Security Service could not write an unauthorised book,\u201d they agreed.",

        "body": "Lara on Claire What were you hoping for? To meet the woman of my dreams and swiftly u-haul it to a coastal location. First impressions? Stunning smile and soulful eyes. And her shirt was cheeky and fun. What did you talk about? Travel. Careers. Awareness that this life is brief and important. Most awkward moment? Leaving at the end, I wanted to ask for her number. While I had to be back home for the little people, I would have loved to have texted her all night. Good table manners? Claire suggested sharing food \u2013 which is most admirable and joyful. Best thing about Claire? Her self-awareness, lack of ego, energy for new opportunities, and courage. Would you introduce Claire to your friends? Yes, my friends would adore Claire. Describe Claire in three words. Wise, generous, playful. What do you think Claire made of you? That I talk too much, and use my hands to exaggerate any story. Did you go on somewhere? We didn\u2019t. If we\u2019d been in our 20s we\u2019d have moved to several destinations and danced the night away. And \u2026 did you kiss? No! And I didn\u2019t even ask for her number. Regrets, regrets, regrets. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? To have started earlier so we could have spent more time in conversation. Marks out of 10? Claire\u2019s a 10 for sure. Would you meet again? I would love to see Claire again. There is so much more I would like to know. Claire on Lara What were you hoping for? I was open to anything. First impressions? Lovely big smile. I instantly relaxed. What did you talk about? Why we chose to blind date. LGBTQ+ communities. Next year\u2019s Sydney Mardi Gras. Family. Most awkward moment? I dropped an overly buttered slab of bread on to my chair. I picked it up, spreading back on the bit of butter that had flown off, and continued eating it. Good table manners? She was right at my level: finger-eating when needed, cutlery when necessary. Best thing about Lara? Her passion for LGBTQ+ community work and the values she holds. Would you introduce Lara to your friends? If I was out with my friends and bumped into Lara, I absolutely would. Describe Lara in three words. Confident, happy, funny. What do you think Lara made of you? I\u2019m usually good at reading people, but it was really hard to tell what she thought of me. Did you go on somewhere? We didn\u2019t, but we stayed until last orders at the restaurant, as we both loved the food. And \u2026 did you kiss? No. Just a friendly hug goodbye. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? That perhaps Lara would feel more comfortable to pose more questions back at me, so she could get to know me more. Possibly she felt nervous or didn\u2019t want to pry, but I felt she knew little about me by the end of the night. Marks out of 10? 7. Would you meet again? I don\u2019t think we will. Our parting and goodbyes felt mutual. Claire and Lara ate at the Strand Bistrotheque, Sydney. Fancy a blind date? Complete the form here (Australia only) or email blind.date@theguardian.com",

        "body": "Born in 1958 in Liverpool, singer, songwriter and producer Ian Broudie is best known for his Britpop-era hits with the Lightning Seeds. As well as being a producer for the likes of Echo and the Bunnymen, the Zutons, the Coral and the Fall, Ian\u2019s eclectic career has included playing guitar for 1970s post-punk group Big in Japan, as well as scoring a No 1 hit with 1996\u2019s football anthem Three Lions. His son Riley, 32, who manages Ian and plays guitar for the Lightning Seeds, will be joining the band as they celebrate their 35-year anniversary with a greatest hits album and tour. Ian For the first five years of Riley\u2019s life, we lived in a sandstone cottage on Beaconsfield Road in Liverpool, opposite Strawberry Fields, the orphanage that inspired the title of the Beatles\u2019 song. In this picture, he\u2019s about four; he\u2019s picked up a guitar and is singing over whatever melody I was trying to write. Often Riley would try to distract me and get my attention when I was working, but I didn\u2019t mind. We would have ended up just playing songs together. I was more of a studio type of musician and didn\u2019t tour until the third Lightning Seeds album, so I was around a lot in Riley\u2019s younger years. I look back at this period at home with him as halcyon days \u2013 the happiest times of my life. I didn\u2019t have too much success yet, but I was on the journey. Riley was a couple of weeks late. When we went past the due date, I started writing The Life of Riley \u2013 the lyrics describe my worries about what I would be like as a dad. As it turns out, I was quite overwhelmed. When I first saw him I was scared and didn\u2019t trust myself not to drop him. The midwife \u2013 a proper scouse nurse \u2013 said to me: \u201cIt\u2019s a boy! Here you are!\u201d and gestured for me to take him. I said: \u201cI don\u2019t hold babies.\u201d She said: \u201cYou do now, love.\u201d She put him in my arms. It was incredible. Like all little babies, Riley would wake up throughout the night. I had a Citro\u00ebn at the time that had suspension brakes. At 4am, I\u2019d wrap him up and we\u2019d get in: I\u2019d turn the heating and suspension on, as well as Oasis\u2019s first album. The songs would play incredibly loud from the stereo while the car went up and down; I snoozed in the front seat while he snoozed in the back. What a sight on our drive that must have been for our neighbours. It\u2019s no wonder he grew up to love Oasis. I split from Riley\u2019s mum when he was seven, and after that we lived apart. I was worried for a lot of that time about what would happen to us, and how our relationship would go. But we became great friends. I decided when he was little that I was going to treat him like an equal: I would explain everything to him like he was an adult, and tried not to fob him off with silly answers if he had questions. It just so happens that he became very inquisitive at school. Teachers were kind of peeved about it, but I thought it was amazing. Riley\u2019s a lot brighter than me, in most ways. I\u2019m not well educated. I left school when I was 15 and I\u2019ve got a really awkward way of writing songs \u2013 it\u2019s based on not knowing how to do certain things and being obsessive until it\u2019s right, but that can also take me to interesting places creatively. The first time we were on stage together, he was 14 and the two of us played acoustically in Liverpool. I wanted him to have that experience, and our chemistry just worked; the way we played guitar knitted together really well, like it does with brothers. At that time, my heart wasn\u2019t in my music. I felt like the band had gone from the Premier League to the fourth division. Gradually I did some more gigs, including one solo show with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014. Ian McCulloch came on for a song, as well as Terry Hall and James Skelly and Bill Ryder-Jones from the Coral. Riley was on guitar. His energy that night was a catalyst for me to enjoy it all again. Gradually, as stuff needed doing in my career, Riley started doing it for me, so he became my manager. I was talking to him the other day, and said: \u201cI find it weird that people say I\u2019m hard to work with. I\u2019m not hard to work with \u2026\u201d There was a long pause from Riley, so I said: \u201cAre you not going to say anything?\u201d He replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything.\u201d I spoke to his mum later on and she confirmed it: \u201cYeah, Riley says you\u2019re a nightmare!\u201d It might be the case, but working with my son is great. He plays with love, and he also phones me up and tells me what I need to do and where I need to go. I need that, as I can be quite unfocused. This photo sums us up: I am a head-in-the-sand kind of person, while he\u2019s more: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on! Let\u2019s get it sorted!\u201d Riley This photo epitomises my childhood \u2013 sat in the garden, playing the guitar with Dad. If we weren\u2019t doing that, then we\u2019d be kicking a football around. Or hanging out in the house, listening to his songs on the radio. Dad\u2019s job always felt normal to me. There was never a moment when it was weird. My mates would know the Lightning Seeds\u2019 stuff, and mostly everyone was nice, even if it was a bit frustrating when people sang Three Lions at me. That didn\u2019t happen too much, and I never felt embarrassed by what my dad had achieved. I was proud. My dad is a big part of my life \u2013 as a parent, but also professionally. We\u2019re super close. My mum and dad split up when I was younger, so I only saw Dad at the weekends. Now we play and tour together, I get some of the time back that we didn\u2019t get when I was growing up. Like anyone with a parent, you get to a certain age and the roles reverse a little. The child feels more responsible. As someone who manages their dad, I certainly feel like that towards him. He now trusts me to make sure everything is right for his career. We have a good laugh on tour, and thankfully if anyone needs telling off, the tour manager can do that \u2013 not me. Dad knows that everything I do is for the best. The best for us, for the band and for his songs, which are so personal. I never expected to join Dad\u2019s band. I was very into studying history. In my gap year between going to university, Dad asked if I wanted to do some gigs with him. One of the first ones was at Glastonbury in 2010. I was very nervous, but after a while I realised that even though I was standing on the Pyramid stage, it was kind of the same as us playing together in the garden. After that, I caught the bug. Playing my dad\u2019s songs is like second nature. They\u2019re so deep inside my consciousness. My dad is open, but he expresses his feelings best in his lyrics. If there\u2019s something he can\u2019t say in a conversation, he hides it in a song. Because I know him very well, I can see it. There\u2019s something special about having a collection of his music, his thoughts. A part of him is here, for ever.",

        "body": "Voices outside the van woke me in the night. I lay still, my mind racing. There had been no one around when I parked at the end of a single track next to a wild beach. Campervanning alone as a woman was going to bring challenges, I knew, and sleeping in remote spots was high on the list of them. Eventually an engine started, they drove off and there was silence. The next morning\u2019s reward was a sunrise of shifting colours over a deserted beach in County Donegal \u2013 another new day all to myself to explore. As far as adventures go, this trip \u2013 10 days travelling alone around the island of Ireland, climbing as many mountains as I could \u2013 was one of my least far-flung. I\u2019d travelled on the Trans Siberian Railway, hiked 500 miles across Spain, walked the Great Wall of China and the Inca Trail. But I\u2019ve learned that you can cram a lot of adventure into a short amount of time, without travelling to far-flung places. I had booked the trip following a painful break-up just two weeks before, deciding it was best not to remain at home nursing heartache. After picking up the van in Belfast, I hit the road with the outline of a plan \u2013 a few ideas on mountains I liked the sound of, but not much else. In the end I completed more than 800 miles, climbed 12 mountains with a total ascent of 5,900 metres \u2013 that\u2019s higher than Everest base camp. My first stop was Glenveagh national park in Donegal, where I climbed the 751m-high Errigal. It\u2019s a well-trodden path, but I had not hiked on my own in Ireland before. The views were amazing and the sense of adventure tangible. Mountain routes in Ireland, I discovered, tend to be either very well known or completely off the beaten track. Drumnalifferny (595m) was a particular challenge \u2013 remote, with just herds of red deer for company. I hiked through boggy land and boulder fields, worried about the daylight and the lack of GPS. But when I made it back to the van after an adrenaline-fuelled day in that little-trodden land, the sense of achievement was exhilarating. The days rolled on, punctuated by wild swims and wild camps (the Park4Night app helped with parking spots \u2013 I was very conscious of not parking where I wasn\u2019t wanted). I grew more confident sleeping alone at night, the van like a cocoon, the sound of waves often lulling me to sleep. I hired a bike, joined a parkrun on Achill island and enjoyed a gig by a folk band at a bar in Westport \u2013 my desire for a pint trumped my fear that I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable on my own there. There was an ever-changing cast of band members, I was made welcome by the chat and laughter of locals and it was a joyful, fun and very welcome evening out after nights alone. I loved travelling the Wild Atlantic Way, climbing 764m-high Croagh Patrick (known as the Reek) in County Mayo, a pilgrimage site with a chapel on top and a view over the 100 or so islands of Clew Bay. It was satisfying to look out and see the road I\u2019d travelled. In the Mourne Mountains, County Down, the weather closed in: I tackled the 850m-tall Slieve Donard in strong winds and challenging weather. I struggled to get the lie of the land in the low cloud, but I was pushing my limits and it felt good. I\u2019d had a very different trip planned with my ex, and a long list of reasons why I shouldn\u2019t go. I was afraid of getting lost, of too much time on my own, of breaking a leg in a remote place \u2026 But adventure doesn\u2019t come without risk, and there\u2019s no risk-taking without a little fear. It\u2019s true that you need to feel the fear and do it anyway. Interviewed by Jane Dunford",

Side note: brands do need to reconfigure their language around this. Saying one person has \u2018normal\u2019 skin automatically assumes everything else is \u2018abnormal\u2019. Anyway, I digress. Our skin shifts as time passes, and hormones and environmental aggressors can play a part in this. Which means our skincare should shift accordingly. Case in point, I\u2019ve always considered my skin very oily (a hangover, perhaps, from my acne-ridden teens) and so a cleansing oil aimed at \u2018very dry to irritated, sensitive skin\u2019 would never have spoken to me. But I didn\u2019t notice that when I stumbled across this cleanser from the French pharmacy stalwart. It was late, I had a face full of makeup, I needed something that would take it off quickly, I spotted the bottle, it said, \u2018Cleansing oil\u2019 and I said, \u2018Great, that\u2019ll do!\u2019 And now, this cleansing oil, with its slightly foamy texture, has quickly become one of my most-loved beauty products. It is incredible. Not only does it remove makeup brilliantly, it is non-greasy, hydrating, excellent value (it\u2019s for face and body) and it balanced out my skin \u2013 which I\u2019ve realised is increasingly dry and dehydrated. So if you are now re-evaluating your skincare and type, this cleansing oil is a good place to start.

        "body": "At some point in the next few paragraphs, I will swoon over the memory of a rabbit and black pudding pie encased in an ornate glazed-pastry case so shiny, so golden, you could wave at your own reflection in it. I will rave about a ludicrously cheap tasting menu of uncommon thrills, a playing field-sized kebab platter and a noble globe artichoke. Because a great plate of food really is a source of happiness. But before we get to the high points of 2023, let\u2019s deal with the low. If 2022 brought fierce economic headwinds for the hospitality sector, this year was simply worse. It was a story played out not in my reviews, but in the \u201cnews bites\u201d that appear beneath them online. Usually, it\u2019s a roundup of pop-ups, charity fundraisers and openings, and there was quite a lot of that. But those news bites were dominated, sadly, by reports of closures. It started in January with the announcement that D&amp;D group was closing Klosterhaus and East 59th in Leeds, as well as the longer-lived Blueprint Caf\u00e9 and Avenue in London. In all they closed six businesses this year. In the summer, we lost two of the UK\u2019s more venerable restaurants, Bully\u2019s in Cardiff and Le Chardon d\u2019Or in Glasgow. Both owners cited rising costs. In Worthing, former MasterChef winner Kenny Tutt closed first Bayside Social and then Pitch, and in Ramsbottom, Levanter Fine Foods went. Then the Belgian-born chain Le Pain Quotidien closed all but one of its 10 UK branches. On and on it went. If you can afford to, please support your local restaurant. You\u2019ll miss them if they go. But let\u2019s hear it for the openings. This year we critics impersonated sheep and piled in to Bouchon Racine, the rebirth in London\u2019s Clerkenwell of chef Henry Harris\u2019s much-loved Racine, originally in Knightsbridge. Then we all said how bloody marvellous his armpit-ripe, butter-smeared bistro cooking was: his snails properly swamped in garlic butter, the calves\u2019 brains with capers, the t\u00eate de veau with sauce ravigote, and a cream-whorled Mont Blanc. It was all the best wobbly rich things. We could, I suppose, have ignored Bouchon Racine. But there\u2019s surely always a place for some wet-lipped fandom. Further into London, the gold and glitter-crusted Criterion at Piccadilly Circus finally got the restaurant it deserved courtesy of the Indian Masala Zone. At the end of that review, I complained about them handing out tablets for instant feedback; apparently that has stopped. Likewise, at the Parakeet pub in Kentish Town it turned out they had withdrawn their pro-dogs policy even before my whinge about the boxer rubbing its arse on me during dinner appeared in print. Still, it inspired a jolly debate, with lots of dog lovers thinking I was the worst human in the world. The row should not have detracted from Ben Allen and Ed Jennings\u2019 impressive live-fire cooking, especially the taut-skinned, funky mutton sausage and the grilled and glazed lamb belly, topped with courgette and salted anchovy. However, the experiences that really stayed with me this year were, as ever, the less glossy, unmarketed ones. Courtesy of the Sportsman Club in West Bromwich I finally got to try a Desi pub, serving the food of the Indian subcontinent, hard by the pool table and the trilling fruit machine. I adored the brazenly red chilli fish and the soothing, iron-rich saag aloo. In Plymouth at Toot, it was all about the fluffy, buttery Persian rice and the ludicrously generous platters of smoky kebabs. As we left, the manager asked us sweetly if we could leave a review on Tripadvisor. I told her I would try to do better than that. I hope I did. Meanwhile, in Salford, there was the Hong Kong caf\u00e9 cooking of the tiny Sakura, tucked into the ground floor of a block of flats: the brow-wrinkling mapo tofu, the spicy instant noodles and the outrageous barm cake, slathered in butter and condensed milk. It took weeks to convince them to let us photograph the place. I\u2019m glad they finally said yes. Glasgow gave me two of the best meals of the year. There was the vegetable-led menu of Rosie Healey at Gloriosa, starting with her stunning focaccia. It went upwards through the chilli butter and roasted aubergine flatbreads, to reach her noble globe artichoke with chive butter. But there was also 111 by Modou, which came with a terrific backstory: its chef, Senegalese-born Modou Diagne, arrived in the city as an asylum seeker, landed a job as a pot-washer in one of chef Nico Simeone\u2019s restaurants and advanced to run the kitchen. Eventually, Simeone put his name above the door. But that wouldn\u2019t have been interesting were it not for the fabulous cooking, served in a \u201cTotal Trust\u201d five-course tasting menu for just \u00a325 a head: the oxtail croquette with black garlic pur\u00e9e, the warm cheesy mousse with chive oil and crispy onions, the salmon raviolo with a dill emulsion. Wow. Glasgow is great. However, two of my greatest experiences this year actually came from a long way south. First, in Aldeburgh there was the Suffolk Sur-Mer, George Pell\u2019s shabby-chic seafood pub, a gull\u2019s wing from the shingle beach. There, I got wistful over asparagus with a frothy brown crabmeat hollandaise, and garlicky lobster and chips. It was all the good things done very well indeed. But it was Lark, housed in a one-time bus shelter turned tiny dining room, that really took my breath away. Chef James Carn produced gorgeous plates of perfectly poised deliciousness: muntjac tartare on a crisp-edged hash brown, lozenges of sherry-cured trout with ribbons of kohlrabi, trout roe and ajo blanco and, of course, the rabbit and black pudding pie. It was an extraordinary piece of work. I described it as the love child of a \u201cWellington and a Scotch egg\u201d. It was bound in a shiny pastry lattice work, and sat on a silky pea pur\u00e9e, itself within a pond of girolles-studded jus. Sometimes, we crave simplicity. Sometimes we need it. But there\u2019s always a place for brilliant, talented chefs showing us exactly what they can do. The rabbit and black pudding pie was certainly my favourite dish of 2023 and Lark, my restaurant of the year. Next year marks my 25th anniversary of writing this column. I\u2019d like to tell you I was thin when I started back in 1999, but I really wasn\u2019t. Still, cooking as good as I\u2019ve been privileged to experience in 2023 doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m very lucky. Here\u2019s to a happy new year.

        "body": "Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos and American actor Emma Stone are quite the collaborative powerhouse. Since working together on dark period comedy The Favourite (2018), which earned 10 Oscar nominations and seven Bafta wins, they have made the short film Bleat and the Oscar-tipped feature Poor Things , and shot another feature, currently entitled Kind of Kindness. Their working relationship is clearly nothing if not productive. In Poor Things, which has been described as a \u201ctwisted science-fiction romantic comedy\u201d (and that doesn\u2019t get close to quite how strange it is), Stone plays Bella Baxter \u2013 a reborn 19th-century woman, living under the paternalistic care of Frankenstein-like surgeon Godwin Baxter (a makeup-laden Willem Dafoe), whom she calls \u201cGod\u201d and who appears to have gifted her with the rapidly developing brain of a baby. While critics have struggled to define the film\u2019s more outlandish elements (the Chicago Sun-Times called it \u201cbeautifully garish\u2026 unabashedly raunchy\u201d, while Empire went with the rather less prosaic \u201cabsolutely batshit, utterly filthy\u201d), Stone says simply that it\u2019s a story about a woman \u201cwho doesn\u2019t have to deal with shame\u201d. When I meet Lanthimos in London, the Oscar campaign around Poor Things is starting to heat up, with a slew of awards and nominations following its Golden Lion win at Venice in September. It doesn\u2019t open in the UK for two weeks, but it\u2019s already the most talked-about movie of 2024. Yet Lanthimos, whose films Dogtooth (2009), The Lobster (2015) and The Favourite all attracted Oscar attention, appears impressively unfazed by all the hoopla. He\u2019s relaxed, easy-going and genial, unlike so many of his movies. I recall that when I introduced Dogtooth on Channel 4\u2019s Extreme Cinema strand several years ago, I hyperventilated about its \u201ceerie, icy\u201d satire and remarked on Lanthimos\u2019s staunch refusal to explain his often surreal movies. \u201cPeople are always trying to get me to confirm their point of view and I just won\u2019t do it,\u201d he once said. But now, sipping coffee in a West End hotel, he seems eager to talk \u2013 to get into the nitty gritty of what Poor Things is really about. Does he agree with Stone\u2019s pithy description of the film, I wonder. \u201cWell, shame is one thing that we are conditioned to feel in certain situations and Emma\u2019s character doesn\u2019t have that,\u201d he says. \u201cShe never got to know what shame is, so she is totally free to give her mind, her thoughts, her opinions, her body, whatever.\u201d I remind him of his own description of the film as being \u201cabout a woman who has a second chance\u201d. He subtly rephrases that description now, reconfiguring it as being about \u201ca human being that has a chance in the world \u2013 someone who hasn\u2019t been moulded in a very specific manner to perceive the world in a certain way. She gets to start clean, and that gives her a far freer view of things. She\u2019s a 28-year-old woman who, up until then, had lived a life that obviously didn\u2019t satisfy her. And she comes back with a blank slate, able to start again, and to own that life.\u201d Poor Things was adapted by Lanthimos and screenwriter Tony McNamara from a celebrated 1992 novel by Alasdair Gray, the Scottish writer who won both the Whitbread award and the Guardian Fiction prize for the book, and who was described in the Guardian\u2019s 2019 obituary as \u201cthe father figure of the renaissance in Scottish literature and art\u201d. In the novel, a rambunctious Victorian pastiche, Gray presents several competing accounts of the life of Bella Baxter. In one version, it is claimed that Dr Godwin Baxter swapped the brain of a drowned woman with that of her unborn foetus, creating a child-like adult with no sense of moral decorum, who embarks on an uninhibited journey of discovery. In another, such claims are dismissed as fantastical tales, reeking \u201cof all that was morbid in that most morbid of centuries, the nineteenth\u201d, wantonly plagiarising \u201cepisodes and phrases to be found in Hogg\u2019s Suicide\u2019s Grave, with additional ghouleries from the works of Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe\u201d. Lanthimos first approached Gray about adapting the novel back in 2011, at which point the author hadn\u2019t seen any of his films. Indeed, Gray\u2019s son had to show him how to work a DVD player so he could watch Dogtooth, which he apparently greatly admired. As for Lanthimos, he was just surprised that Poor Things hadn\u2019t already been adapted for the screen. \u201cIt was incredible because it\u2019s so cinematic,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated but you can see clearly that there is a film in here. So as soon as I found that it hadn\u2019t been made I went up to Scotland to meet him, and when I arrived he was there at the door, putting on his jacket. He just said, \u2018Follow me!\u2019 and started showing me around Glasgow, very fast! Because the novel takes place in Glasgow, and this was his world. Then we went back to his house and he said, \u2018I think you are a talented young man and I would be happy if you want to make my film.\u2019 Then I got back on to the train and went back to London. We never really talked about it again after that.\u201d How faithful was he to the source? \u201cWell, the essence of it is very much in the novel. The novel has a very different structure, a very different narrative. Her story is mainly being told by all these other men, so it has various literary devices that sometimes refute \u2013 is that the right word? \u2013 that sometimes announce what they say as false. We made a shift from the novel because the film is solely about her journey, her perspective. And I felt that if we were going to do this, this world needs to be seen through her eyes. So I thought that we should build this world; go into a studio and build everything, use old-school techniques and make everything ourselves and paint backdrops and make the sets and have a tactile sense of this world.\u201d Lanthimos also crucially decided to drop \u201cthe part of the novel which is like a philosophical political essay about Scotland and its relationship to England and the world. I thought that couldn\u2019t be part of the film, both in terms of just practically making that kind of philosophical essay into a film, but also me being a Greek person, making a film about Scotland. It would have been totally disingenuous of me.\u201d As a proud advocate of socialism and Scottish nationalism, politics was very important to Gray, whose most (in)famous novel is often referred to as a \u201cpolitical allegory\u201d. Lanthimos\u2019s films have regularly dealt with thorny issues of personal liberation and societal repressions (the performative grieving rituals of Alps, 2011; the absurdist personal \u201cdefining characteristics\u201d of The Lobster) but in the past he has declared flatly: \u201cIf I wanted to talk about politics or social problems I\u2019d become a writer. But I\u2019m a film-maker and that\u2019s all I can do.\u201d I wonder if that position has shifted \u2013 whether he now sees his films as being at all political, or polemical. \u201cNot polemical, no. But I think in some sense they are political, without declaring a specific ideology. When you make films in the world and deal with the issues you mention, that\u2019s a kind of political act \u2013 a comment, an urge to ask questions about things. Most films that have some profound questions are political in one way or another.\u201d I wonder what formed Lanthimos\u2019s inquisitive worldview. \u201cWell, it is still being formed day by day,\u201d he laughs. \u201cRemember, I grew up in Greece, and I never imagined that I would be able to make films \u2013 not at all.\u201d The son of a shop owner and a professional basketball player, Lanthimos pursued business and marketing studies before deciding that his future lay in directing. Switching to the Hellenic Cinema and Television School Stavrakos in his native Athens, he wound up making commercials, music videos and dance films, certain that he would never get the chance to direct a feature. \u201cIn Greece a decade or so ago there wasn\u2019t any film industry or tradition,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were two or three standalone film-makers who were working. But you couldn\u2019t get financing. But then at some point I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t we just go and make a film ourselves? We don\u2019t need much. Let\u2019s get a camera, we\u2019ll pay for the film, the lab, pay for some actors, go someplace and just shoot something. What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019 I never imagined that people would watch this stuff! I thought that it was something we\u2019d show to our friends and they would be happy that we made it. Then slowly, people started to appreciate it, and somehow it became a reality that we might be able to make films for a living. Not in Greece \u2013 that\u2019s why I moved to England, to London, after the three films I made in Greece. But the method was the same.\u201d Lanthimos and his wife, Greek-French actress Ariane Labed (who appears in both Alps and The Lobster), returned to Athens in 2021 but the director still seems to be on home turf here in London. As we order more coffee, I stop to check that my phone is recording our conversation, apologising for the fact that I\u2019m constantly terrified of being let down by digital technology. I\u2019m slightly embarrassed but Lanthimos is absolutely delighted. \u201cWe are the same!\u201d he declares. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wish to shoot everything on film! I have shot a couple of films digitally and I totally hated the experience.\u201d I ask what it was particularly that Lanthimos disliked about shooting on digital and the answer seems to be\u2026 everything! \u201cI just don\u2019t appreciate the process,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBeing on set and watching these things that look like a soap opera on the monitor. It kind of distracts you. You don\u2019t understand what it is that you\u2019re getting and you\u2019re seeing, and then you have to live with that horrible image during post-production and editing. Then when you are finishing the film you are just striving to make it look like something \u2013 to add texture, make the skin tones look kind of OK; it\u2019s an effort to make it look OK instead of enjoying a creative experience. Also, I just feel that everybody senses there is something a little more precious going on when you are doing a take on film instead of just pressing a button. And I am becoming more hardcore. I have just built a darkroom \u2013 a studio in Athens for developing and printing my film. Actually, during Poor Things, I would shoot pictures on set, on film. And after finishing filming, Emma and I would go together and develop all the negatives. It just became this thing of winding down and relaxing after an intense day of shooting. We\u2019d go and process the film of the day.\u201d I ask Lanthimos to describe his creative relationship with Emma Stone, and how their latest project (originally titled AND before being renamed Kind of Kindness) is shaping up. \u201cIt\u2019s all shot and we have started editing,\u201d he confirms. \u201cIt\u2019s a contemporary film, set in the US \u2013 three different stories, with four or five actors who play one part in each story, so they all play three different parts. It was almost like making three films, really. But it\u2019s great to be working again with Emma. It makes it so much easier to have someone there who trusts you so much, and who you trust so much.\u201d Describing his casting methods as \u201cvery intuitive\u201d, Lanthimos recalls meeting Stone for the first time and knowing immediately that they could work together. \u201cI just thought that she had something very special. I\u2019d seen the work that she\u2019d done, and I thought that she would be great for The Favourite. She had seen The Lobster and Dogtooth, and she said, \u2018I like what you do, so let\u2019s just do it.\u2019 She is ready to do whatever it takes to get things done. And apart from her being an incredible actress, it\u2019s just being able to communicate with someone without having to explain anything, without having to use too many words. Just getting it.\u201d This kind of creative intimacy is crucial for Poor Things, not least because the central role of Bella presents a series of exposing challenges for the actor. \u201cDefinitely. But by the time we made Poor Things, we\u2019d already made The Favourite, and we had become friends. And then we shot this silent short film, Bleat, in Greece for the Greek National Opera. That was a very special experience because Emma came to Greece and went to an island. It reminded me of the way that we made the early films in Greece.\u201d A three-time Oscar nominee (she won Best Actress for La La Land), Stone was reportedly the highest-paid actress in the world in 2017. Yet according to Lanthimos she is far more interested in the prospect of pursuing smaller-scale passion projects than big Hollywood blockbusters. \u201cWith Bleat, we had a crew of 10 people on an island in winter,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t the rest of the world around us \u2013 it was just us. Emma actually said after, \u2018Why can\u2019t we make all films like that? Why do we have to have all these people around? I just want to be here, me and you and the camera and whoever else is absolutely necessary, and just make this and make it intimate.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019ve been striving for this ever since I started making English language films!\u2019 I was always saying that we don\u2019t need all these people. And the truth is that on Poor Things we did manage to do that quite a few times. I said to [cinematographer] Robbie Ryan, \u2018I know there are these huge sets and there are going to be hundreds of people around but why don\u2019t we just hang the lights from the ceiling and then send everybody out. Close the door so it\u2019s just us in the room. If we need anyone, we\u2019ll call them \u2013 they\u2019re just outside the door \u2013 but let\u2019s just create this intimate situation again. And that\u2019s what we did.\u201d Our conversation turns towards Jerskin Fendrix, the Golden Globe-nominated British musician who provides the electrifyingly eclectic score for Poor Things. When Lanthimos heard Fendrix\u2019s 2020 album Winterreise, he had the feeling that he had discovered another creative soulmate. \u201cThere are so many different sounds in his work, so many different feelings. There\u2019s humour, there\u2019s melodrama. It\u2019s playful, it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, but it can be heavy when it needs to be. I found the sound so particular and so beautiful. I just felt there was something in the soul of this thing that would somehow fit into the world of Poor Things. And when I played the album for Emma, she said, \u2018It\u2019s like everything in your head exploded into music.\u2019\u201d Fendrix\u2019s music definitely helps to connect Poor Things\u2019 audience with the film\u2019s off-kilter emotional heart. I note that while Lanthimos\u2019s films often have fairly cerebral conceits (the value of one life over another in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, for example), they work because on some level they elicit a visceral response; they make you squirm, or cry, or wince, or (most often) laugh. \u201cYes, yes!\u201d he responds. \u201cBeing moved or laughing is something you can\u2019t help but experience by feeling. I appreciate that much more than the intellectual part of it. You can think, \u2018Oh, this is a great film because of this and this\u2019, but if you don\u2019t experience it in the moment, if you don\u2019t feel something, even if you don\u2019t know what it is, then what\u2019s the point?\u201d What makes Lanthimos laugh? \u201cMark Ruffalo in rehearsal!\u201d he replies immediately (the actor is heavily Oscar-tipped for his hilarious portrayal of Bella\u2019s pompous buffoon of a beau, Duncan Wedderburn), before offering a more considered response: \u201cThe awkwardness of human interaction and behaviour, I guess, is what makes me laugh.\u201d I wonder whether Lanthimos also sees a philosophical bond between the created, artificial worlds of Poor Things and Dogtooth, in which a controlling father keeps his children imprisoned in their home, isolated by invented tales about tiny planes and killer cats. \u201cWell, the imprisonment of Bella and the fact that she doesn\u2019t understand the world and she is kept there, is very much something that exists in Dogtooth,\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut Poor Things is more like what happens when she gets out. I have to say, I didn\u2019t think about that when I read the novel. But when we were actually making the film, the parallels became more apparent. Dogtooth explores the confines of the family, or whatever social structures can manipulate human perception. Poor Things takes that as a starting point, and then you see how that can have an impact when you come into contact with the real world.\u201d Does Lanthimos have a favourite among his own films? \u201cThey are all problematic children,\u201d he sighs, \u201call problematic in different ways.\u201d And does he ever rewatch them? \u201cI did, about a year ago. And during the pandemic, I thought: \u2018Let\u2019s have a look at what we\u2019ve done here.\u2019 I watched The Favourite, Dogtooth, Sacred Deer. I was pleasantly surprised.\u201d Surprised how? \u201cI thought they were worse!\u201d he laughs. \u201cI thought they were worse and when I saw them I was like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s not that bad! It works well.\u2019 I mean, you can never make a perfect film, but it\u2019s well put together and there are ideas there that are interesting. And I guess that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\u201d Poor Things opens in UK cinemas on 12 January",
